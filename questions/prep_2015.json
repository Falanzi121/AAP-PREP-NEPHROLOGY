    "explanation": "E. ventricular fibrillation\nHyperkalemia impairs cardiovascular, neuromuscular, renal, endocrine, and metabolic\ndysfunction. The most life-threatening complication of hyperkalemia is cardiac\narrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and asystole. Hyperkalemia causes the\ncardiac membrane potential to be unsteady by altering the resting membrane potential.\nAn unsteady cardiac membrane potential can result in cardiac arrhythmias, including\npeaked T-waves, widening of the QRS complex, loss of P waves, asystole, and\nventricular fibrillation. These findings are based not only on the level of extracellular\npotassium, but also on how quickly the change in potassium level has occurred over\ntime. Electrocardiographic changes that generally occur at a concentration greater than\n7 mEq/L (7 mmol/L) in children with chronic hyperkalemia may be seen at lower levels\nin children with an acute rapid rise in serum potassium, resulting in a swift decrease in\nthe transmembrane potassium gradient.\nIn patients with acidosis, the excess hydrogen ions are buffered in the intracellular\ncompartment and electroneutrality is maintained by movement of the intracellular\npotassium into the extracellular space.\nMuscle weakness is usually ascending, beginning in the legs and progressing to the\ntrunk and arms, which can progress to flaccid paralysis.\nEmergent treatment of hyperkalemia includes nebulized albuterol, intravenous calcium\nto stabilize membrane potential, intravenous sodium bicarbonate to drive potassium\nintracellularly, and glucose and insulin to also drive potassium into cells. Sodium\npolystyrene sulfonate and the initiation of dialysis therapy are used to remove potassium\nfrom the body.\nThere are many causes of hyperkalemia including acute kidney injury, spurious\nhyperkalemia, drug-induced hyperkalemia, type 4 renal tubular acidosis, increased\ntissue catabolism as occurs in tumor lysis syndrome, hemolysis, and necrotic tissue, as\nwell as other causes.\nWhile hyperkalemia may be the result of reduced renin (and aldosterone) secretion,\nonce developed, hyperkalemia leads to an increase in renin secretion, a compensatory\n\nmechanism designed to improve renal potassium secretion. Incidentally, the increase in\nrenin also results in renal vessel vasodilation and reduced or unchanged normal systemic\nvascular resistance. Hyperkalemia does not cause increased blood pressure. While\nhyperkalemia may lead to skeletal muscle weakness (eg, flaccid paralysis) and smooth\nmuscle dysfunction (eg, paralytic ileus), the most serious outcomes of hyperkalemia are\ncardiac conduction disturbance and arrhythmias.\nPREP Pearls\n Cardiac arrhythmias are the most life threatening complication of hyperkalemia\n There are multiple causes of hyperkalemia in children\n Severe hyperkalemia required urgent treatment\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia\nSuggested Readings\n Andreoli SP.

    "explanation": "D. lower birth weight is associated with hypertension caused by a lower nephron\nendowment\nObtaining a detailed birth history is an important part of your initial evaluation of any\npediatric patient presenting with a new diagnosis of hypertension. Birth weight provides\ninformation and can initiate dialogue regarding potential prenatal and early postnatal\nrisk factors, maternal health and nutrition, premature delivery, and the early neonatal\ncourse, including any need for a neonatal intensive care unit stay. In addition, low birth\nweight is a risk for masked hypertension.\nLow birth weight is often a result of prematurity or suboptimal fetal growth. Both can\nlead to impaired or incomplete renal development, resulting in diminished nephron\nendowment. Nephrogenesis is not complete until approximately week 34 to 36 of\ngestation, therefore neonates born earlier than that time period may not develop their\nfull complement of nephrons. While nephrogenesis can occur postnatally, it is often\nsuboptimal, does not progress much further than 40 days after birth, and is often\ncompromised by further renal insults related to the care of premature infants (eg,\nsepsis, hypotension, administration of nephrotoxic agents such as furosemide and\ngentamicin). As a result, premature infants are at risk for lower functional renal mass\nthan those born full term, placing them at risk for hypertension.\nNeonates born full term but small for gestational age are also at increased risk for the\ndevelopment of hypertension. Both animal and human studies have demonstrated\nhigher blood pressures among those born with low birth weight when compared to those\nnot born small. This risk is also shown to increase with increasing age: for each 1 kg\nincrease in birth weight, blood pressure is lower by 1 to 3 mm Hg in adolescence, and\nlower by 5.2 mm Hg among individuals 64 to 71 years of age. The etiology of this\nassociation is also felt to be related to lower nephron mass, termed \"congenital\noligonephropathy,” among low birth weight individuals related to the intrauterine\nenvironment and impaired renal development. In addition, low birth weight neonates\nalso often experience “catch-up growth” that places increased metabolic demands on the\nkidneys. This accelerated postnatal growth can lead to further nephron loss.\nCongenital oligonephropathy leads to hypertension via hyperfiltration of the remaining\nnephrons and eventual glomerulosclerosis over time, with further nephron dropout\n\nsimilar to what is seen in renal disease. This compensatory renal hypertrophy among\nindividuals born with a low birth weight and its association with hypertension was nicely\ndemonstrated in 2 studies of white adults. Individuals with low birth weight had almost\n25% lower nephron endowment, with each individual glomerulus larger than expected\nwhen compared to individuals who did not have a low birth weight. When the overall\nglomerular tuft volume (number of glomeruli x average glomerular volume) was\ncompared, there was no difference between groups based on birth weight. This\npreserved glomerular tuft volume despite lower nephron endowment was also\ndemonstrated when the same individuals were dichotomized based on their hypertensive\nstatus; hypertensive individuals had fewer, larger glomeruli with overall unchanged total\nglomerular tuft volume compared to normotensive individuals.\nInterestingly, neither the association of hypertension with congenital oligonephropathy\nnor with low birth weight is as clearly evident among African Americans. In contrast to\nthe previously mentioned studies done in white adults, several studies have shown no\ndifference in glomerular number or birth weight between hypertensive and normotensive\nAfrican Americans.\nWhile high birth weight (> 10 lbs) is known to be associated with the development of\nobesity in adulthood, it is not an independent risk factor for the development of\nhypertension. In fact, a high nephron number protects against the development of salt-\ninduced chronic hypertension. Further, it is lower birth weight neonates, not greater\nbirth weight neonates, that are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease risk factors\nlater in life such as diabetes, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction. This\nincreased risk is thought to be caused by accelerated postnatal weight gain. Increased\nearly weight gain velocity is also independently associated with greater blood pressure\nand hypertension later in life. While neonates with low birth weight may experience\ngreater neonatal stress and be exposed to more inflammatory processes, this is not\nconsidered part of the pathogenesis of later hypertension.\nFinally, low birth weight adolescents newly diagnosed with hypertension are more likely\nto have primary, not secondary, hypertension.\nAdditional Readings\n\nPREP Pearls\n Low birth weight, either caused by prematurity or suboptimal fetal growth, is\nassociated with elevated blood pressure and primary hypertension.

    "explanation": "C. intravenous D5 one-fourth normal saline at a rate of 300 mL/m2 per day plus replace\nongoing losses\nThe patient in this vignette presented with oliguria and acute dehydration from a\ngastrointestinal illness. Initial evaluation revealed 10% to 15% dehydration, and initial\nappropriate therapy with fluid boluses of 20 mL/kg normal saline was administered.\nAdequacy of fluid therapy is demonstrated by the normalization of heart rate and blood\npressure. However, she has remained anuric and has now developed worrisome\nperipheral edema. Laboratory evaluation meets the diagnostic criteria for acute kidney\ninjury (AKI). Based on the increase in serum creatinine to greater than 3 times the\nexpected normal value for her age, as well as the persistent anuria, she currently has\nAKI stage 3 based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) staging. The\nmost appropriate management at this time is to provide intravenous D5 one-fourth\nnormal saline (without potassium) at a rate of 300 mL/m2 per day (to account for\ninsensible water losses) and additionally replace any ongoing losses from diarrhea or\nvomiting.\nGastrointestinal illnesses are the commonest cause of dehydration and pre-renal AKI\nworldwide. In many cases, patients present with oliguria and an increase in blood urea\nnitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, with a history and physical findings consistent\nwith dehydration and a pre-renal etiology. In such cases, a fluid challenge may be\ndiagnostic as well as therapeutic. Typically, fluid challenges in children consist of normal\nsaline in the dose of 10 to 20 mL/kg, repeated once or twice until urine output improves.\nAdequacy of fluid therapy is best demonstrated by the normalization of vital signs and\nphysical examination, re-establishment of urine flow (and a subsequent reduction in BUN\nand serum creatinine), all of which would also confirm a pre-renal etiology. Thus, any\nchild with a clinical history and physical examination consistent with hypovolemia\nrequires immediate intravenous fluid therapy in an attempt to restore renal function and\nprevent the progression of pre-renal AKI to intrinsic AKI. Commonly used fluid for\nresuscitation is normal saline (20 mL/kg given over 30 min, repeated twice as needed).\nIncreasing evidence suggests that isotonic crystalloids such as normal saline should be\nused instead of colloids for initial expansion of intravascular volume in patients at risk\nfor AKI or with AKI.\n\nThe majority of children with dehydration will respond to 2 to 3 intravenous boluses of\nnormal saline and can then be switched to standard regimens that allow for complete\nrehydration to occur in the subsequent 24 hours. These regimens typically employ\nintravenous D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq/L of potassium at twice the\nmaintenance rate. However, the persistence of anuria and development of fluid overload\n(as exemplified by the vignette), or an absence of improvement in BUN and serum\ncreatinine, would indicate the diagnosis of intrinsic AKI and would call for an urgent\nchange in medical management. When urine output does not improve after restoration\nof intravascular volume, more invasive monitoring (including bladder catheterization,\nimaging of the kidney and urinary tract, and central venous pressure monitoring in\nselect cases) may be required to guide further therapy. The clinician must also pay\ncareful attention to ongoing fluid losses (insensible water loss of approximately 300 to\n500 mL/m2 per day, in addition to replacement of urine and gastrointestinal losses) and\ngains (fluids, medications, and nutrition administered). Insensible water losses are\nhigher in febrile children and lower in ventilated children with decreased respiratory\nlosses. Insensible water losses are best replaced with D5 one-fourth normal saline, and\npotassium should be avoided until after urine output has been convincingly\ndemonstrated.\nIn patients with fluid overload, the achievement of negative balance may require\nreplacement of less than the total ongoing losses. Early renal replacement therapy\nshould be considered for critically ill children with intrinsic AKI and greater than 10% to\n20% fluid overload who are not expected to recover kidney function expeditiously.\nThe other responses provided in the vignette are incorrect. Additional boluses of normal\nsaline are contraindicated in anuric children with physical signs of fluid overload, due to\nthe risk of pulmonary edema. Intravenous potassium is contraindicated in anuric\npatients. Stopping all intravenous fluids in this child with ongoing diarrheal losses carries\nthe risk of recurrence of dehydration and worsening AKI. In children with hypotension\nnot responsive to volume repletion alone, preservation of blood pressure and renal\nperfusion with appropriate inotropic agents may be considered to prevent AKI. However,\nin children who are volume replete with normalization of blood pressure (as in this\nvignette), the use of inotropic agents such as “renal dose” dopamine is not indicated.\nThe use of low “renal dose” of the inotropic agent dopamine (0.5 to 3 mg/kg/min) is\ncommon in the critical care setting because of its renal vasodilatory and natriuretic\n\neffects. However, prospective randomized studies of adult patients at risk for AKI have\nnot shown a beneficial renoprotective effect of “renal dose” dopamine. Furthermore,\nthere are risks associated with even “renal dose” dopamine, including tachycardia,\narrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and intestinal ischemia. Therefore, the routine use of\ndopamine for prevention or treatment of AKI is not recommended.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Evaluate the clinical course and adequacy of fluid therapy for an oliguric patient\nSuggested Readings\n Devarajan P.

    "explanation": "D. renal hypercalciuria\nIn 1978, Moore et al showed that the prevalence of hypercalciuria in children is about\n3% to 6%. The cutoff for normal calcium excretion varies by age. While a\ncalcium/creatinine ratio of less than 0.2 mg/mg is considered normal in older children\nand adolescents, higher ratios are considered normal in neonates and infants. Generally,\nhypercalciuria in children is defined as urine calcium excretion exceeding 4 mg/kg/day.\nThe random urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio can be used to screen for hypercalciuria,\nwhile the timed collection, if feasible to perform, confirms the diagnosis.\nWhile the pathogenesis of hypercalciuria was traditionally thought to be caused by either\nincreased intestinal calcium absorption or increased renal calcium excretion, the process\nis far more complex. The approach to patients with hypercalciuria therefore requires\nunderstanding about the differentiation of types of hypercalciuria. Indeed, as elegantly\ndescribed by Srivastava and Schwaderer and others, understanding the pathogenesis of\nhypercalciuria requires knowledge about the roles of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,\nbone, kidneys, and several hormones in calcium homeostasis.\nIdiopathic hypercalciuria may result from one (or combinations of) of several processes:\n1) Type I absorptive hypercalciuria: This is caused by increased calcium absorption in\nthe GI tract. Patients with this type feature normal serum calcium and normal or low\nparathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Examples include congenital sucrase-isomaltase\ndeficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption, Down syndrome, Williams-Beuren\nsyndrome, and blue diaper syndrome.\n2) Type II absorptive hypercalciuria: This rare entity is caused by elevated 1,25-\ndihydroxyvitamin D-stimulated calcium absorption. These patients may not develop\nelevated urinary calcium levels if kept on a low calcium diet.\n3) Type III absorptive hypercalciuria: Patients with this subtype have decreased renal\nreabsorption of phosphorus (renal phosphate leak), leading to hypophosphatemia. This\nstimulates the conversion of 25 vitamin D to 1,25 vitamin D, resulting in increased\nintestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. The end result is hypercalciuria. The\nserum calcium and PTH levels are usually normal. The cause is usually elusive.\n4) Renal hypercalciuria: This type reveals decreased renal reabsorption of calcium.\n\nInitially, the serum calcium level is low, stimulating high PTH and vitamin D levels. This\n3\ninduces increased GI absorption of calcium and hypercalciuria. Examples include\nidiopathic hypercalciuria, Dent disease, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with\nhypercalciuria, Wilson disease, familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and\nnephrocalcinosis, Liddle syndrome, and Lowe syndrome.\n5) Resorptive hypercalciuria: This is due to enhanced bone resorption and is generally\ncaused by hyperparathyroidism. Affected patients develop hypercalcemia, elevated\nvitamin D levels, and hypercalciuria. Examples include McCune-Albright syndrome,\n3\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia 1 syndrome, Jansen disease, and infantile\nhypophosphatasia.\nIn most children with idiopathic hypercalciuria with normal serum calcium, no further\ninvestigations other than 24 hour urine collection may be needed for diagnosis. In\nselected cases, laboratory tests are needed for further evaluation of hypercalciuria and\ndifferentiating the subtypes listed; symptomatic patients (ie, with suspected\nnephrolithiasis) may also require renal imaging studies. In asymptomatic children,\nlaboratory evaluation could include a detailed but focused and logical metabolic screen.\nThis should be done while the patient is on a regular diet. The initial blood tests should\ninclude serum calcium, creatinine, and phosphate studies, along with PTH and vitamin D\nlevels. If the history, examination, and initial laboratory tests do not provide definite\nclues to the etiology of hypercalciuria, a calcium-loading test may be performed for\nfurther evaluation. In patients with absorptive (GI) hypercalciuria, urine samples will\nshow a significant increase in urine calcium concentration. In contrast, calcium loading\ndoes not result in an increase in urine calcium concentration in patients with renal\nhypercalciuria.\nThe boy in the vignette has normal serum calcium and phosphate levels, along with a\nlow PTH level and elevated 1,25 vitamin D level. Patients with Dent disease have renal\n3\nhypercalciuria and also feature mild proteinuria and excessive amino acid excretion. The\ndiagnosis can be established by genetic testing of the patient or of the affected parent.\nSince Dent disease is inherited in a X-linked pattern, it almost exclusively affects males.\nThe lack of available information about this boy’s family history complicates the\nevaluation. While patients with type I absorptive hypercalciuria may have normal serum\ncalcium and phosphate levels, with low PTH levels, they often have a clinical history (eg,\nsyndrome) featuring enhanced GI calcium absorption. Type II is rare, and the patient\n\nwould have an elevated, not suppressed, 1,25 vitamin D level. Patients with type III\n3\nhave hypophosphatemia, while those with the resorptive type feature hypercalcemia and\nelevated 1,25 vitamin D .\n3\nAs mentioned, the serum calcium level alone can provide valuable clues to the etiology\nof hypercalciuria.

    "explanation": "C. dopamine infusion\nSubstances that stimulate the renal sodium-potassium ATPase (Na-K-ATPase) contribute\nto reduced retention of Na, while substances that inhibit the ATPase contribute to\nreduced excretion of Na. The catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine play a\nprominent role in the renal regulation of sodium homeostasis and blood pressure. Both\nsubstances interact with the renal tubular sodium-potassium ATPase (Na-K-ATPase) and\nthereby play a role in renal sodium regulation.\nDopamine inhibits the ATPase. As a result, dopamine increases sodium excretion and,\nunder certain circumstances, may contribute to the development of hyponatremia. In\naddition, dopamine may further exacerbate hyponatremia by stimulating antidiuretic\nhormone (ADH) secretion; this induces sodium excretion, although the role that this\nmechanism plays in overall sodium balance is unclear. Indeed, studies in animals and\nhumans display that dopaminergic agents induce hyponatremia. Dopamine and\nnorepinephrine mediate their effect on sodium transport via the dopamine-specific\nprotein phosphatase-1 inhibitor, DARPP-32, and the norepinephrine-activated protein\nphosphatase-2B, calcineurin, respectively. These effects are more pronounced during\nrenal development.\nDopamine infusion is the most likely reason for the development of hyponatremia in the\nchild in the vignette, via inhibition of the renal Na-K-ATPase. While hyponatremia may\nbe caused or exacerbated by alterations in fluid balance (eg, hyponatremic dehydration,\nretention of water), this child’s vital signs suggest relative euvolemia. While underlying\nrenal disease may result in renal sodium wasting, this child had a glomerular disease\nand did not have the typical histology (eg, renal dysplasia) expected to result in excess\nsodium losses. Although dopamine has been suspected to induce ADH secretion, and, as\na result, natriuresis, this mechanism is not confirmed. Regardless, this child’s urine\nspecific gravity is not consistent with increased ADH activity. Administration of isotonic\nintravenous fluid should not cause hyponatremia.\nBasiliximab has not been shown to significantly and consistently affect sodium transport,\nwhile corticosteroids stimulate sodium retention. It should be noted that among the\nother immunosuppressive agents used in transplant, there is evidence that cyclosporine\n\nand tacrolimus inhibit the Na-K-ATPase, possibly contributing to hyperkalemia. In some\nseries, tacrolimus has been associated with the development of hyponatremia.\nDopamine is formed in the proximal tubule cells as a result of uptake of filtered L-DOPA,\nthe latter of which is decarboxylated to dopamine. Dopamine regulates sodium balance\nby various mechanisms, including inhibition of proximal tubular sodium reabsorption.\nThis effect is unrelated to the effect of dopamine as a vasodilator. Dopamine receptors\nare essential for its uptake. There are various receptor groups, the most essential being\nthe D1-like receptors. The D1 receptors are coupled to G proteins. For example, infusion\nof a D1-like receptor antagonist (SCH-23390) in animals reveals a significant role for\ndopamine in basal sodium excretion. Dopamine inhibits the Na-K-ATPase in the proximal\ntubule, thick ascending limb of Henle, distal tubule, and cortical collecting duct. While\nD1-like receptors inhibit the ATPase, D2-like receptors generally stimulate the Na-K-\nATPase.\nThe catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine are released from the sympathetic\nnerves and the adrenal medulla. The effect of norepinephrine on sodium reabsorption is\nopposite to that of dopamine. Norepinephrine activates the Na-K-ATPase, thereby\nstimulating Na reabsorption. Studies show that norepinephrine has no impact on the\nsodium-hydrogen exchanger or other sodium-dependent (eg, sodium-phosphate\ncotransport) mechanisms. While norepinephrine increases sodium retention, it increases\nblood pressure. In response to volume depletion, norepinephrine, similar to angiotensin\nII, raises the blood pressure while concomitantly stimulating sodium reabsorption via\ndirect stimulation of proximal and loop of Henle sodium reabsorption, altered peritubular\ncapillary hemodynamics, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by\nthe ß1-adrenergic receptors. Compared to norepinephrine, epinephrine has a minimal\neffect on renal sodium balance.\nCatecholamines also regulate renal blood flow and function. Acute increases in renal\nperfusion pressure result in a direct increase in urinary sodium excretion via tubular\nreabsorption. Indeed, adrenergic innervation has been identified in the renal vasculature\nand in the proximal tubule, loop of Henle, and distal tubule. Renal sympathetic activity\ntends to be increased in states of effective circulating volume depletion. Norepinephrine\nis the most potent vasoconstrictor among the catecholamines and it reduces renal blood\nflow in an effort to maintain perfusion to the brain and heart. Dopamine is a renal\n\nvasodilator at low concentrations, thereby lowering renal vascular resistance. Overall,\nenhanced sympathetic activity increases sodium reabsorption, an effect that may\ncontribute to the compensatory renal sodium retention seen with volume depletion. This\noccurs via direct effects on the Na-K-ATPases and via increased renin release and renal\nvascular resistance, together shifting the pressure-natriuresis curve to the right.\nDuring development, the ability of renal nerve stimulation and catecholamine release to\nincrease renal vascular resistance and reduce renal blood flow is not as robust as it is in\nolder subjects. During the antenatal period, renal nerve stimulation generally induces\nsodium retention. The concentration of dopamine is higher in the fetal rat than the adult\nrat, thereby counterbalancing the retention of sodium exhibited by other\ncatecholamines.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the role of renal nerves and circulating catecholamines circulating\ncatecholamines in influencing sodium reabsorption during development\nSuggested Readings\n Abdulnour-Nakhoul S, Khuri RN, Nakhoul NL.

    "explanation": "E. untreated, her predicted survival to 18 years of age is less than 50%\nThis patient presents a difficult dilemma. The severity and significance of diseases that\nare now mostly controllable or preventable is not appreciated by some families. To\nunderstand the often malignant catastrophic course of untreated childhood lupus\nnephritis, one must go back to the literature.\nIn 1 published study describing 150 patients with systemic lupus (approximately one-\nthird of whom had pediatric systemic lupus) in the early 1970s, patient survival before\nthe use of cyclophosphamide or rituximab was approximately 75% at 5 years after onset\nof disease. Studies done from the early 1950s to mid-1960s reported 5-year survival\nrates around 50%. For those with lupus nephritis in those studies, the 5-year patient\nsurvival rate with diffuse proliferative or membranous lesion was approximately 30%,\nand for those with focal proliferative lupus, patient survival was around 70%. Thus, the\nnatural history of untreated systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is dismal.\nThe presentation of childhood lupus rarely occurs before 5 years of age (< 5%) and\nmost patients (about 60%) present after 10 years of age. Compared to adults, children\nhave a more severe presentation with a higher risk of hemolytic anemia, lupus nephritis,\nmalar rash, and systemic features such as weight loss, fever, and fatigue. Lupus\nnephritis occurs in over 50% of patients with systemic lupus in most childhood series.\nDespite modern therapy, up to 10% of children with severe forms of lupus nephritis may\nprogress to end stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 5 years of onset of lupus nephritis.\nHowever, after renal transplantation, the majority of children with a history of ESKD due\nto lupus nephritis achieve outcomes similar to those with other causes of ESKD. These\npatients do have an elevated risk of death (1.8-fold) possibly related to other\ncomorbidities.\nThe long term outcome of childhood onset lupus in adulthood has been examined in a\nlarge cohort of 662 childhood systemic lupus patients. The patients in the study were\ndiagnosed after 1983 and were 81% female, with an average follow-up of 10.7 years.\nForty-four percent of the patients had biopsy-proven lupus nephritis. During the\nobservation period, 7% developed ESKD. The mean age of ESKD onset was 30 years of\nage, and ESKD occurred about 18 years after disease onset. Other reported\n\ncomplications of lupus included hip, knee, and ankle replacements (less than 4%),\nmalignancy (2%), and cerebral vascular accidents (6%). Thus, the long term, treated\nnatural history of systemic lupus and lupus nephritis in the modern era is still\nconcerning.\nThe prevalence and demographics of SLE in children has been studied. In a Medicaid-\nenrolled population, the prevalence is approximately 10 per 100,000 children. In that\nstudy, SLE was over 5 times more common in girls than boys and over one-third had\nlupus nephritis. In addition, there was a higher prevalence of both lupus and lupus\nnephritis among nonwhite children; per 100,000 Medicaid-enrolled children a prevalence\nof 23.79 in patients of Asian ancestory, 14.08 in African Americans, 11.51 in Hispanics,\n13.38 in Native Americans and 4.86 among Whites was found. Geographically, the rates\nof SLE and lupus nephritis are lower in the Midwest compared to other regions of the\nUnited States, which has been ascribed in part to differences in regional ethnic\ncomposition.\nThe comparative risk for SLE nephritis in children based on ancestry or ethnicity has not\nbeen reported. In North American adults, the risk for SLE is highest for those with West-\nAfrican and African-Caribbean descent. There is also evidence for an increased risk for\nSLE among individuals with Native American, Polynesian, Asian Indian, Chinese, and\ncertain Hispanic (Mestizo) backgrounds, with a reduced risk among individuals with\nEuropean ancestry.\nGenetics has a strong role in SLE susceptibility with a concordance rate in monozygotic\ntwins of over 25%, and, in some series, over 50%. Dizygotic twins have only a 2% to\n5% concordance rate. Despite the extensive efforts to assess the genetic risks for SLE\nwith genome-wide association studies, it appears that much of the genetic susceptibility\nto SLE is caused by numerous variants that are common in the population and\ncontribute a small or modest degree to disease susceptibility. For example, while various\ngenetic factors such as the genes IRF5, STAT4, and TRAF1-C5 seem to increase the\nsusceptibility to developing SLE, they have not been shown to increase the risk for lupus\nnephritis.\nOverall, the propensity for renal involvement is highest in adults of sub-Saharan African\nancestry. Recently, the risk for ESKD in African Americans with lupus nephritis was\n\nfound to be strongly associated with the APOL1 risk alleles, with an adjusted odds ratio\nof 2.7 for those carrying risk alleles. Some of this excess risk was reduced after\nadjustment for hypertension and diabetes.\nAdditional Readings\nPREP Pearls\n Untreated lupus nephritis is deadly\n Multiple genes are associated with lupus susceptibility\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the natural history and epidemiology of systemic lupus erythematosus\nSuggested Readings\n Aggarwal A, Srivastava P.

    "explanation": "D. peritonitis\nAscites is defined as the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, causing\nabdominal swelling. Most ascitic fluid in adults accumulates as a result of a disease\nprocess affecting the hepatic or gastrointestinal systems, but other systems that may be\ninvolved in the pathogenesis include the urinary tract.\nA useful and instructive way to assess the pathogenesis of ascites is to consider if the\nfluid represents a transudate (low protein [< 2.5 g/dL], low lactate dehydrogenase\n[LDH], high pH [at least 7.40], low cholesterol, low specific gravity [< 1.012], normal\nglucose, and fewer than 1 white blood cell per 1,000 mm³) versus an exudate (high\nprotein [> 2.5 g/dL], high LDH, low pH [<7.30], high cholesterol, high specific gravity\n[> 1.020], low glucose, and many white blood cells per 1,000 mm³). Finally, measuring\nthe serum to ascitic fluid albumin gradient (SAAG) may help differentiate a transudate\ndue to hepatic disease or portal system obstruction from other causes; a high (> 1.1\ng/dL) gradient suggests the etiology is in the hepatic and portal system. Observing the\nappearance of the fluid may also be informative; peritoneal fluid is usually straw-colored\nand clear. The fluid may be yellow in patients with liver disease, milky in patients with\nlymphatic obstruction, red-tinged if blood is present, green in the presence of bile, and\ncloudy if there are microorganisms.\nThe peritoneal fluid analysis for the neonate in the vignette is a classic exudate (high\nprotein, high LDH, low pH, high cholesterol, high specific gravity, low glucose, and many\nwhite blood cells per mm³). Given the paracentesis results, the most likely cause of this\nneonate’s ascites is an inflammatory process, such as peritonitis. Congenital\nneuroblastoma is a rare cause of ascites in the newborn period. Ascites from liver\ndisease would yield a transudate, not an exudate. Moreover, the appearance of ascites\nfrom hepatobiliary disease is often delayed for several weeks after birth. It is also\nimportant to note that other causes of a transudate may include cardiac disease or\nnephrotic syndrome. Obstruction from lymphatic drainage (chylous ascites) would not\nordinarily yield an exudate.\nIn older children and adults, transudates are often the result of increased pressure in the\nportal vein (due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis), while exudates are generally the\n\nresult of an inflammatory or malignant process. In the newborn period, there are many\ncauses of ascites. In 1 series of 27 cases of neonatal ascites, the causes were: urinary\n(7 cases) caused by congenital urinary tract malformations such as posterior urethral\nvalves and vesicoureteral reflux, gastrointestinal (5 cases) caused by ileal and other\nmalformations or obstructions, cardiac (3 cases) caused by paroxysmal supraventricular\ntachycardia, hepatic (2 cases), and mixed causes (10 cases). In another case series,\nLord et al reviewed 28 fully documented cases of neonatal ascites and found a definite\netiology in 22 cases, among which 18 had obstructive urinary tract lesions, the most\ncommon being posterior urethral valves. Yet, while urinary tract obstruction is a\ncommon cause of neonatal ascites, the likelihood of developing urinary ascites from a\ncongenital urinary tract malformation is very low, or about 1 in every 100 cases. Other\ncommon causes of neonatal ascites are listed in the Table.\n\nTable. Causes of Neonatal Ascites.\nUrinary Tract:\no Posterior urethral valves\no Intraperitoneal bladder\no Vesicoureteral reflux\no Neurogenic bladder/rupture\no Ureteral obstruction/perforation\nGastrointestinal:\no Ruptured liver tumor or hemangioma\no Intestinal lymphangiectasia\no Spontaneous bile duct perforation\no Perforation of the gall bladder\no Stress ulcer\nOther:\no Chylous ascites\no Congenital neuroblastoma\no Stress ulcer\no Ruptured adrenal\no Ruptured spleen\no Meconium ileus\no Fetal hydrops\no Heart failure\no Persistent cloaca\no Hernia\n\nAnother cause of ascites in the newborn is chylous ascites. In adults, chylous ascites is\ncommonly caused by lymph obstruction or intra-abdominal malignancy; in the newborn,\nit is usually secondary to congenital obstruction of the lymphatic system, including\nstenosis of the thoracic duct. Another proposed etiology is poor communication between\nthe peripheral and central (major) lymphatic systems. The onset of symptoms may be\ninsidious. If there is chylous ascites at birth, there may be abdominal distension and\nrespiratory distress with a fluid hernia.\nThe most common cause of neonatal ascites is the urinary tract, therefore the fluid may\nbe straw-colored. Identifying the site of leakage from the urinary tract was previously\ndifficult, but with modern imaging studies, this is now more feasible. Urine may leak\nfrom any site along the urinary tract, therefore careful attention to all sites is prudent.\nOnce urine leaks into the subcapsular space, it will easily find its way into the peritoneal\ncavity. When urinary ascites presents at birth, there is often a history of premature\nlabor. The birth weight is usually normal, but the abdomen is distended and there may\nbe respiratory compromise. It is not uncommon, in milder cases of obstruction and leak,\nfor there to be a delay in presentation of ascites for several weeks.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the different causes of ascites in the newborn period\nSuggested Readings\n Aslam M, DeGrazia M, Gregory ML.

    "explanation": "C. inflow pain\nBicarbonate-based peritoneal dialysate (PD) solutions are available in many countries\noutside of the United States, but have not yet been approved for use in the United\nStates. There is a risk for calcium carbonate precipitation, so a double chamber bag is\nused that separates the basic and acidic solutions until being used on the cycler\nmachine. This is unique from the lactate-based solutions that are used in the United\nStates.\nThe improved biocompatibility of bicarbonate-based solutions has many reported\nbenefits over lactate-based solutions including increased ultrafiltration volume, better\npreservation of urine output, and reduced inflow pain. Inflow pain is felt to be a direct\nconsequence of the acidic pH of standard lactate-based solutions, while bicarbonate-\nbased solutions have a neutral pH and are less likely to cause this adverse effect.\nThere are a variety of PD solutions available both inside and outside of the United\nStates, which may include different osmotic agents and buffers, as well as variations in\nelectrolytes. The different osmotic agents include glucose, glucose polymers (icodextrin),\namino acids, and polypeptides. Glucose is an inexpensive osmotic agent, however, both\nglucose and its degradation products (GDP) can induce injury to the peritoneal\nmembrane through both vascular proliferation and induction of fibrosis. Icodextrin\ncontains less GDP than standard glucose-containing solutions while having the\nadvantage of preserved ultrafiltration with long dwells. Icodextrin has been shown to\nimprove ultrafiltration, better control fluid overload, preserve residual renal function, and\nimprove creatinine clearance when compared to standard glucose-containing PD\nsolutions. Amino acid-based PD solution contains no GDP, but may also act as a\npotential protein source for malnourished PD patients.\nThe different buffering agents are lactate (only available in the United States), acetate,\nand bicarbonate, with some solutions containing a combination of buffers (mainly lactate\nand bicarbonate). The concentration of buffer can vary from 34 mEq/L to 40 mEq/L.\nCitrate has been considered as an alternative, as it may also provide anti-coagulative\nproperties. However, to date, there are limited studies in animals, without any clear\nadvantages seen with its use.\n\nFor patients receiving acute PD, some modifications (such as potassium) in the dialysate\nsolution can be provided depending on the patient’s clinical status; alterations in\ndialysate calcium or bicarbonate concentration are not recommended due to risk of\nprecipitation. For patients receiving chronic care, the electrolyte concentrations in\ncommercially available PD solutions can vary some, but not greatly, with the\nconcentration of calcium being altered most commonly. The typical electrolyte\nconcentration ranges for patients receiving chronic care are:\n Sodium, 130 mEq/L to 137 mEq/L (130-137 mmol/L) (132 mEq/L in North\nAmerica)\n Calcium, 10 mg/dL to 14 mg/dL (2.5-3.5 mmol/L)\n Magnesium, 0.5 mEq/L to 1.5 mEq/L (0.25-0.75 mmol/L)\n Potassium, 0 mEq/L to 2 mEq/L (0-2 mmol/L) (0 being most commonly used)\nMost commercially utilized bicarbonate-based solutions are available with similar\nconcentrations of sodium, glucose, calcium, and magnesium as lactate-based solutions.\nThere is also no reported difference in the peritoneal transport characteristics of these\nsolutions, so there should be no difference in the serum levels of these electrolytes when\nswitching from bicarbonate-based to lactate-based solutions. Decreased reflexes from\nhypermagnesemia should not occur, as standard PD solutions contain 0.5 mEq/L (0.25\nmmol/L) of magnesium, which should not cause hypermagnesemia. Increased thirst\nfrom hypernatremia should not occur, as the sodium concentration of solutions in North\nAmerica is 132 mEq/L (132 mmol/L), which is similar or slightly decreased from\nstandard solutions in Europe. Muscle cramping from hypokalemia is less likely to occur,\nas acidosis is more likely to occur with the use of lactate-based solutions. Hypocalcemia\nhas not been seen at an increased rate with the use of lactate-based solutions compared\nto bicarbonate-based solutions, while tetany has not been reported. One reported\nchange that has been seen with bicarbonate-based solution is improvement of acid-base\nstatus in both adults and children.\nPREP Pearls\n Bicarbonate-based peritoneal dialysate (PD) solutions feature a double chamber\nbag, which is requisite to add both bicarbonate and calcium\n\n There are many benefits of bicarbonate-based solutions over lactate-based\nsolutions, but those that may be directly seen by providers are improvement in\nacidosis, improvement in ultrafiltration, and avoidance of inflow pain\n There are some variations of electrolyte concentrations between different PD\nsolutions worldwide, but these variations are not that great for sodium and\npotassium.

      "pneumothorax",
      "pulmonary embolism",
      "pleural effusion The answer is A The clinical history, and timing of presentation of this ‘s respiratory distress makes flash pulmonary edema the most likely etiology of his pulmonary symptoms. Flash pulmonary edema is a known complication in individuals with renal artery stenosis (RAS), which can be exacerbated by the initiation of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). Renal artery stenosis can occur any time after renal transplantation, with it more commonly occurring between 3 months and 2 years post-transplant. Risk factors for the development of post-transplant RAS include surgical complications related to the harvest and anastomosis, delayed graft function, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and donor atherosclerotic disease. Renal artery stenosis of any cause leads to renal hypoperfusion and a decrease in intraglomerular flow. To preserve renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated, leading to increased salt and water retention, changes in vascular tone, and increased sympathetic nervous system activity. The resultant increase in effective circulating volume and direct systemic vasoconstriction causes systemic hypertension, as there is no opportunity for negative feedback with continued renal hypoperfusion seen with stenosis. In addition to these effects, angiotensin II helps maintain intraglomerular pressure and therefore the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by preferentially increasing efferent arteriolar resistance. As opposed to the circumstance in patients with 2 functioning kidneys, in patients with a solitary kidney, there is reduced ability to modulate sodium and water secretion, resulting in the increased proclivity of hypertension due to volume retention (ie, lack of pressure diuresis). This has been demonstrated in experimental studies comparing the 2-kidney 1-clip (unilateral RAS with a normal contralateral kidney) versus the 1-kidney 1-clip (unilateral RAS with no contralateral kidney). In the 2-kidney 1-clip model, the contralateral kidney can compensate by enhancing sodium and water excretion, which is not feasible in the 1-kidney 1-clip model. These autoregulatory responses are also disrupted and largely reversed with ACE inhibition and angiotensin II blockade. These agents cause a reduction in intraglomerular pressure by preferentially dilating the efferent arteriole and blocking angiotensin II production (ACEi) or action (angiotensin II receptor blocker; ARB). In addition, the effective circulating volume may be reduced and systemic blood pressure lowered, reducing renal blood flow further. With significant reductions in blood pressure, either with ACEi/ARB therapy or other antihypertensive agents, renal perfusion can be decreased to the point where functional renal mass is lost. This loss of functional renal tissue occurs because of cortical ischemia, interstitial inflammation, tubular atrophy, and irreversible fibrosis. Use of an ACEi or an ARB in individuals with RAS, either those with a solitary (native or transplanted) kidney or those with bilateral disease, can lead to several complications soon after starting therapy. One of the more commonly known adverse effects of these medications is a rise in serum creatinine, related to the reversible decline in the GFR described. A rise in plasma creatinine of 30% or more after starting ACEi or ARB therapy is suggestive of RAS. This impairment in renal function with angiotensin inhibition can also lead to hyperkalemia, as was seen in the patient in the vignette. Flash pulmonary edema (FPE) is another known complication of ACEi/ARB therapy in patients with either bilateral RAS or unilateral stenosis of a solitary kidney. While FPE is commonly associated with acute decompensated heart failure, FPE in this setting occurs because of amplification of the pulmonary RAAS, increased sympathetic nervous system activation, and reduction in nitric oxide production. Together, this results in enhanced vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction. Ultimately, left ventricular end diastolic pressure increase, exacerbating the neurohumoral activation and causing pulmonary capillary stress failure. Patients present in respiratory distress with cough, dyspnea and tachypnea, with or without chest pain. An examination may reveal hypertension, a heart murmur, S3, rales, hepatomegaly, or peripheral edema. A chest radiograph would show pulmonary edema. Other findings associated with RAS include resistant hypertension and an acute rise in blood pressure. In the patient described in the vignette, he had controlled blood pressure until recently, which also coincided with upper respiratory symptoms. It is possible that CMV infection, a known cause of RAS, or another infectious agent could have led to pneumonia; however, the lack of a fever does not support this diagnosis. Pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, and pleural effusion are other causes of respiratory distress; however, the clinical presentation in this vignette that includes acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia, makes FPE related to ACEi/ARB initiation the most likely etiology.

      "peritoneal dialysis (PD) Answer B The patient in this vignette has the typical clinical manifestations of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Based on the increase in serum creatinine to greater than 3 times the baseline value, as well as the persistent oliguria, he has AKI stage 3 based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) staging. He has also developed azotemia, hyperkalemia, and a 20% fluid overload. He remains critically ill, on mechanical ventilation, with hemodynamic instability, requiring vasopressor therapy for blood pressure maintenance. He needs urgent renal replacement therapy for fluid removal, as well as clearance of potassium and nitrogenous wastes, in a manner that will not compromise hemodynamic stability. Mere fluid restriction will not be sufficient. In an ideal situation, the preferred modality of therapy is continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). In general, the indications for dialysis in pediatric AKI include the following:  Symptomatic uremia  Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, or acidosis unresponsive to nondialytic medical management  Fluid overload  Oliguria requiring fluid restriction that limits nutritional and other supportive care In critically ill children, the epidemiology of AKI has changed from primary renal diseases to one characterized by a consequence of other systemic or multi-organ disease. Fluid overload and oliguria requiring fluid restriction have emerged as the most common reasons to initiate renal replacement therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU). The Prospective Pediatric Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy Registry Group, via the analysis of its 340 patient cohort, showed that when fluid overload was dichotomized to greater than 20% and less than 20%, patients with greater than 20% fluid overload at continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) initiation had an adjusted mortality odds ratio of 8.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-25.7). These findings have now been confirmed in adults with AKI and fluid overload. Furthermore, outcomes were superior when CRRT was initiated earlier in the ICU course. Thus, the available data, although largely observational, indicates that outcomes are improved if CRRT is initiated earlier in the clinical course and at a lesser degree of fluid overload. The child in this vignette, with a documented 20% fluid overload, ongoing oliguria, and ongoing anticipated need for supportive critical care (including nutrition, antibiotics, vasopressors, and blood products) is ideally suited to receive CRRT. Over the past 2 decades, CRRT has become the preferred modality for the management of the critically ill, hemodynamically unstable child with AKI and fluid overload. This is in part due to advances in CRRT technology, allowing for more precise and reliable treatment delivery with greater ease of operation. Clinical experience has demonstrated several advantages of CRRT over more traditional dialytic modalities in critically ill patients. Removal of fluid and solutes occurs gradually, but continuously during CRRT. Therefore, hemodynamically unstable patients who may not tolerate large volume and solute concentration changes that characterize standard hemodialysis can be safely managed with CRRT. While peritoneal dialysis can also provide gradual clearance of solutes and fluid, CRRT has the advantage of independently controlling the degree of fluid removal and solute clearance. Furthermore, certain modalities of CRRT can provide solute clearance that exceed the efficiency of standard peritoneal dialysis treatments. The nomenclature of CRRT is based on the ensuing primary method of solute clearance. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) provides primarily fluid removal, with convective solute clearance afforded by the high ultrafiltration rates. In continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), the majority of solute clearance is diffusive, provided by the countercurrent infusion of dialysate through the hemofilter. In continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), both diffusive and convective clearance of solutes is achieved. The choice of CRRT modality used is often based on institutional standards and familiarity, the availability of appropriate replacement and dialysis solutions, and the primary goal of therapy. CVVH is often employed when the primary goal is fluid removal. CVVHDF is the preferred modality in patients requiring improved small solute clearance in addition to fluid removal, such as those with azotemia or hyperkalemia (as is the case in this vignette). It should be noted that middle molecule (eg, β-2 microglobulin) clearance is superior with CVVH versus CVVHDF. Moreover, it should be acknowledged that solute clearance, especially using postdilution replacement fluids, with CVVH alone would also likely be of nearly equal efficacy for the child in this vignette, if institutional preference and limitations in availability of dialysate fluid steer the clinician in that direction. Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) provides rapid ultrafiltration and solute removal, and is often the modality of choice for the treatment of ingestions, drug toxicity, severe fluid overload, and severe hyperkalemia. A 4-hour IHD session provides solute and fluid clearance comparable to 24 hours of CRRT. IHD can be performed outside of critical care units and provides a large window of dialysis-free time for procedures and imaging, which can be complicated in patients on CRRT. In addition, in contrast to CRRT, there is reliable information on drug clearance in IHD. However, the major disadvantage of IHD is hemodynamic instability and hypotension, which commonly occur in critically ill children. This often leads to early termination of treatment and limited ability to achieve the fluid and solute removal goals. In addition, fluid restriction is usually required during the 20 hours of dialysis- free time, which can compromise ongoing clinical care and nutrition. Hence, IHD is not best suited for the child in this vignette. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has historically been the most widely employed dialytic modality in children with AKI, and remains widely used in facilities where IHD and CRRT are not available. Just like CRRT, PD provides gentle continuous removal of fluid and solutes. However, CRRT technology now allows for a greater degree of, and better precision in, daily clearance rates of fluid and solutes in comparison to PD. Ultrafiltration and solute clearance occur slowly with PD, therefore this modality is not optimal in patients with severe volume overload or hyperkalemia (as is the case in this vignette). Furthermore, patients on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory compromise may not tolerate large volumes of dialysate in the abdomen. Finally, PD should be approached with caution in patients with suspected intra-abdominal pathology.

      "neonatal respiratory distress syndrome Answer C Nephrocalcinosis (NC) in children may occur at any age, but is more prevalent in the first few years after birth. The main reason for this phenomenon is that NC is often caused by inborn errors of metabolism or tubular abnormalities that exist at birth. A rare but treatable cause of NC is primary hyperoxaluria. Several other main etiologies of NC are shown in the Table. The pathogenesis of NC, regardless of the cause, involves 2 main mechanisms. The initial event is the formation of crystals in the renal tubule. This provides a nidus for retention for aggregation of the crystal. It should be noted that adherence of calcium to the tubular epithelium requires intact, undamaged epithelium. Interestingly, immature or proliferating epithelium (as seen more commonly in newborns and infants) is uniquely vulnerable to crystal formation. Any factor (presence of stone inhibitors) that protects against crystal formation and growth will counteract the development of NC. The infant in the vignette has a typical history for the development of NC. The most important factor contributing to the development of NC in this infant is immaturity of the renal tubules, which provides a nidus for calcium crystallization. A history of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) or (hyaline membrane disease) is not uncommon in infants who develop NC, usually due to furosemide (loop diuretic) use, which promotes hypercalciuria and NC. While a history of furosemide use is not mentioned in the vignette, it is a major risk factor for NC. African American children are less likely to develop NC than white children; epidemiological data in children of other races are lacking. Since calcium channel blockers enhance cellular uptake of calcium, their use would tend to decrease, not increase the risk for NC. Worldwide, the incidence of NC is similar in males and females. A history of NRDS itself does not increase the likelihood of developing NC. Early studies suggested a very guarded prognosis for children with NC. Pope et al studied 13 infants who developed NC from loop diuretic use. Over the follow-up period of up to 10 months, NC resolved in 6 patients, but persisted in 7. The mean time to resolution was 5.2 months following discontinuation of the diuretic. Ezzedeen et al followed 17 infants with NC due to diuretic therapy. They found that despite resolution of imaging evidence of NC in the majority of patients, renal function remained compromised in some. Downing et al assessed renal function in 27 preterm infants, including 10 who received furosemide and developed NC. Compared to infants that did not receive furosemide or who received furosemide but did not develop NC, those with NC had significantly lower renal function, higher urinary calcium/creatinine ratios and fractional excretion of sodium, lower tubular reabsorption of phosphate, and impaired bicarbonate reabsorption. More recent studies suggest that if the cause can be addressed, spontaneous resolution occurs in the majority of preterm infants. One prospective study showed that NC persists in 35% of patients at 15 months and 15% of patients at 30 months, with 10% to 25% showing persistent radiological findings 7.5 years later. The renal function was similar in those with or without radiologic evidence of persistent lesions. Other complications or associated symptoms may develop with NC, including hematuria, urinary tract infection, and urolithiasis. Management initially involves identifying clues to the etiology. Eliminating the offending agent (eg, furosemide) or the treatment of underlying renal disorder (eg, renal tubular acidosis) is essential to reducing the long term morbidity of NC. Initial testing includes obtaining a baseline urine calcium-to- creatinine ratio, serum chemistry, including calcium, creatinine, and phosphate levels, and if the diagnosis is unclear, serum parathyroid hormone and vitamin D levels. Once diagnosed and the cause identified, management of NC involves meticulous re-assessment of renal involvement. This requires serial ultrasonography, intermittent measurement of renal function, and intermittent surveillance of urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio.

The renal biopsy is consistent with abnormalities of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) (diffuse foot process effacement), increased mesangial matrix, segmental sclerosis, and moderate tubulointerstitial disease. This constellation of findings is consistent with Pierson syndrome. Pierson syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and is caused by mutations in the LAMB2 gene that encodes for the laminin β2 protein. Since laminin β2 is required for the formation of normal basement membranes, patients with Pierson syndrome feature nephrotic syndrome (may be congenital or appear later in childhood) and ocular complications (eg, abnormal lens, retinal, and cornea). Some affected individuals may also develop microcoria and hypotonia, as was evident in this child. The symptomatology and age of onset of the various symptoms in Pierson syndrome vary. While the patient described in the vignette has nephrotic syndrome that developed at 2 years of age, the renal disease onset and severity varies in affected children. In a case report by VanDeVoorde et al, the affected patient presented at birth and renal biopsy revealed diffuse mesangial sclerosis. In general, glomerular diseases comprise a vast array of disorders characterized by specific derangements of glomerular structures. The capillary wall is the unit where filtration occurs, and itself is composed of endothelial cells and the GBM. The GBM consists of collagen, laminin, polyanionic proteoglycans, fibronectin, and other glycoproteins, podocytes/foot processes, and mesangial cells. The GBM is subdivided into 3 parts: lamina densa, lamina rara interna, and lamina rara externa. All 3 parts of the basement membrane are comprised of 2 main elements: 1. Basal lamina: An extracellular matrix that is comprised of type IV collagen, laminin, nidogen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The basal lamina is an essential part of the glomerular filtration barrier. It provides a barrier between the epithelial cells (podocytes) and the underlying connective tissue. Pathology develops if this barrier is interrupted. The basal lamina of the visceral epithelium fuses with the glomerular capillaries, forming a filtration membrane. 2. Reticular lamina: Made of reticular tissue, collagen fibers, and matrix. It provides support for the basal lamina. Laminin and type IV collagen are the major components of the basal lamina, with type IV collagen being most abundant. These chains interject to form a mesh-like polymer. Laminin has binding sites for nidogen (or entactin), proteoglycans, α-dystroglycan, and integrins. The role of the GBM components in renal disease is profound. Indeed, different isoforms of these molecules are produced and each is found in certain tissues. Alport syndrome is the most widely known renal disease involving disruption of the basal lamina. Patients with Alport syndrome feature progressive nephritis and hearing loss. The prevalence of Alport syndrome is estimated at 1 out of 5,000, although this may vary according to locale. The histology includes thickening of the GBM with splitting and fragmentation of the lamina densa, forming the classic “basket weave” pattern. The genetics reveal an abnormality in type IV collagen of the basal lamina. Other diseases characterized by abnormalities in the components of the GBM are listed in the Table. Proteoglycans (eg, heparan sulfate) are essential components in the GBM. They play a vital role the proper organization and function of the GBM, and help maintain the selective permeability of the GBM. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans bind chemokines and help recruit leukocytes to the extracellular matrix, thereby contributing to inflammation. However, there is no evidence that proteoglycans are involved in the pathogenesis of Pierson syndrome. Nidogen (also termed entactin) is another important GBM component that binds laminin and type IV collagen. Studies suggest its potential involvement in disorders of renal development (eg, renal agenesis), but not in glomerular disease. As mentioned, abnormalities in type IV collagen cause Alport syndrome and benign familial hematuria, each with characteristic renal and extrarenal manifestations. Patients with Alport syndrome or benign familial hematuria have features distinct from patients with Pierson syndrome. Finally, fibronectin has been implicated in fibronectin glomerulopathy, a disease mainly observed in adults and featured by nephrotic syndrome and glomerular deposits with fibril formation, but without extrarenal manifestations.

      "use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor preferentially lowers renal vasculature resistance and increases the glomerular filtration rate in newborns Answer: A The rate of production of glomerular ultrafiltrate or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a function of the surface area and hydraulic conductivity of the glomerular basement membrane, the net hydrostatic force across the membrane and the glomerular blood flow rate. During in utero development, dramatic changes in the number and function of the glomeruli occur. In the fetus, the first permanent functioning nephrons are formed at about 10 weeks and the development of additional glomeruli ceases at about 34 weeks of gestation. In utero renal blood flow and GFR are low, but do not determine the fetus’s creatinine. The fetal creatinine is reflective of maternal creatinine because of the minimal transplacental gradient of creatinine. At birth, renal blood flow dramatically increases and GFR increases. Despite having a full adult complement of nephrons, a newborn’s GFR, adjusted for body surface area, is less than a third of an adult. Glomerular filtration rate increases by at least two-fold by age 2 weeks in a term baby and reaches adult levels by 2 years of age. Much of the change in glomerular function is due to increases in renal blood flow (3-7% in fetus, 10% by a week of age, and eventually 20% to 25% of cardiac output in the adult). Renal hemodynamics are controlled in large part by the renin-angiotensin system. At birth, systemic blood pressure is low and renovascular resistance is high. At this time, the renin-angiotensin system is highly activated, but falls in the first weeks of life and throughout infancy. Previously, the administration of angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) in newborns for hypertension was associated with significant hemodynamic complications (hypotension, seizures) until this high renin state in the term newborn was appreciated and dosage adjustments were made, leading to modified dosing of ACEi of about 10% of that used in older infants and children (per kg). Another important factor contributing to the postnatal increase in GFR is the structural maturation of cortical development. As elegantly shown by Spitzer and Brandis, renal maturation proceeds from the inner cortex outward. As a result, the abundant outer cortical nephrons develop later and slower. Once those outer cortical nephrons develop further, GFR rapidly increases. Assessing serum creatinine in a cord blood sample is unnecessary because the newborn’s serum creatinine generally reflects the maternal level. In addition, there are risks associated with obtaining cord blood samples, including blood loss, infection, and the development of air bubbles. Moreover, if reduced renal function is suspected in a newborn, more traditional methods can be employed to obtain a sample. Systemic blood pressure rises, accompanied by a decrease, not increase, in renal vascular resistance, resulting in a doubling of GFR during the first few weeks of life. As the kidneys more than double in length from the newborn period to adolescence, increases in GFR are also facilitated by increases in glomerular surface area and permeability. Indeed, while glomerular number peaks at 34 weeks of gestation, the mean glomerular diameter increases by over 50% and the mean glomerular surface area more than doubles by adolescence. PREP Pearls  The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is extremely low in utero.  The GFR doubles by 2 weeks of age and is at adult levels (normalized for size) by about 2 years of age.

      "vitamin D deficiency Answer: D Hypocalcemia may be true or spurious (pseudo, artifactual) and causes for both are shown in the Table. The infant in the vignette has chronic diarrhea and edema. The presence of edema, even in the absence of a serum albumin level, should raise the suspicion of significant protein loss caused by protein-losing enteropathy. Thus, this infant likely has hypoalbuminemia with a normal ionized calcium level, consistent with pseudohypocalcemia (or artifactual hypocalcemia). The infant has moderately elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, most likely caused by acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to reduced renal perfusion. It should be noted that while hypocalcemia may occur in AKI, it is more commonly seen in patients with chronic kidney disease. Alkalosis also contributes to hypocalcemia by reducing the concentration of acids in the blood, thereby preferentially increasing the binding of alkali with calcium, resulting in reduced free serum calcium. While excess serum phosphate can bind calcium (forming precipitate), the serum phosphate level in this infant is normal for age. Vitamin D deficiency is unlikely in this infant, owing to the normal serum phosphate level. Finally, unlike gadolinium agents used in magnetic resonance imaging, oral contrast agents such as iodine- containing agents have not been shown to cause hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia caused by hypomagnesemia is due to suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) release and end organ (mostly bone and kidney) resistance to PTH, the latter of which is a potent positive regulator of serum calcium. Hyperphosphatemia causes hypocalcemia via the binding of calcium by the excess phosphate, with subsequent precipitation of the product in tissues. Pseudohypocalcemia in patients with hypoalbuminemia features only a decline in the total calcium, not ionized calcium level. A reliable estimation of the impact of serum albumin on total serum calcium is for every decline of albumin by 1 g/dL (10 g/L), the total serum calcium falls 0.8 mg/dL (0.20 mmol/L). The mechanism of pseudohypocalcemia after use of gadolinium and other magnetic resonance imaging agents is suspected to be related to the binding of calcium by chelating agents present in the agents. Another plausible explanation is the interaction between gadolinium and orthocrescolpththalein, the latter of which is used in calorimetric assays to measure calcium. Finally, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in lavender top tube can excessively bind calcium and release potassium, resulting in pseudohypocalcemia and pseudohyperkalemia. If pseudohypocalcemia is suspected (ie, no obvious identifiable cause for hypocalcemia is elucidated), it is prudent to measure the ionized calcium level. As mentioned, if the ionized calcium level is normal, one must strongly suspect pseudohypocalcemia caused by hypoalbuminemia. The levels of other parameters that may help determine the etiology of hypocalcemia include serum magnesium, vitamin D, and PTH levels. Table. Causes of True Hypocalcemia and Pseudohypocalcemia.

Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract are associated with over 200 syndromes and represent a wide range of abnormalities that result from abnormal development of the renal parenchyma, abnormal renal migration, or abnormalities of the collecting and drainage system. The general incidence of unilateral renal aplasia is about 1 out of 2,000 live births. Abnormal renal parenchymal development is manifest by renal agenesis, renal dysplasia, renal tubular dysgenesis, and cystic renal disease, including the polycystic renal diseases. The abnormalities of renal parenchymal development can be seen in isolation or in association with disruption of the normal embryologic migration of the kidneys and vessels, examples of which include the pelvic kidney and horseshoe kidney. In addition, there may be isolated or concomitant abnormalities in the development of the collecting system (ureteropelvic junction obstruction), ureter (megaureter, ectopic ureter, or vesicoureteral reflux), bladder (bladder exstrophy), and urethra (posterior urethral valves). Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are usually identified on prenatal ultrasonography and are confirmed by postnatal ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). Prenatal ultrasonography findings of bilateral hydronephrosis, dilated bladder with a thickened wall, and a dilated posterior urethra in a male fetus is suggestive of PUV. There may also be oligohydramnios, urinary ascites or perinephric urinoma from rupture of a posterior fornix of a kidney, bladder diverticulum, patent urachus, and increased renal echogenicity and cortical cysts, suggesting renal dysplasia. Renal and urologic manifestations of PUV include chronic kidney disease, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and bladder dysfunction. Vesicoureteral reflux is present in about half of patients with PUV. This is termed secondary VUR and is caused by increased intravesical pressure from bladder outlet obstruction. In boys with PUV, the incidence of end stage renal disease by 16 years of age is 25% when bilateral VUR is present, 7% when unilateral VUR is present, and only 4% when VUR is absent at initial evaluation. In contrast, primary VUR may occur in isolation or in association with a single kidney, dysplasia, or ectopic kidney. Primary VUR is found in up to half of single kidneys when contralateral aplasia or cystic dysplasia is present. By international consensus, primary VUR is graded 1 through 5. Grades 1 to 2 (mild) and 3 (moderate) is nonrenal parenchymal dilating reflux and 4 to 5 (severe) is renal parenchymal dilating reflux. The risk of reduction in functional renal parenchymal tissue is increased with higher grades of reflux and is either congenital due to abnormal renal development or acquired related to renal parenchymal infection. Appropriate management of PUV and VUR depends on the extent of the abnormality (eg, higher grade of VUR or bilateral generally requires prophylactic antibiotic) and associated renal parenchymal involvement. Patients with PUV or higher grade VUR will require close urological management and attention to the risk of urinary tract infection. Lessons in the optimal management of urinary tract anomalies can be derived from outcome studies in patients with renal agenesis or renal dysplasia. The prognosis of renal agenesis or renal dysplasia depends on whether there is unilateral versus bilateral disease and whether there are associated urological disorders. In a study from Turkey, chronic kidney disease developed in 5 out of 51 patients, 4 of whom had urological anomalies, while the other patient had a small hyperechoic solitary kidney. Among the 3 patients who had hypertension, 2 had an associated urological anomaly while 1 developed proteinuria. Thus, other urological anomalies often accompany unilateral renal agenesis and these patients should be followed closely and managed to reduce risk of end stage renal disease. The outcome of patients with a solitary kidney was studied by Schreuder et al. They found that among 66 patients with a solitary kidney, microalbuminuria or hypertension was present in 50% at 1 point in time. They concluded that systematic follow-up of blood pressure, proteinuria, and renal function in all children with congenital solitary functioning kidneys, especially in patients with a low birth weight, is justifiable. While a comprehensive discussion of treatment paradigms for hypertension and proteinuria in patients with renal agenesis or dysplasia is beyond the scope of this critique, appropriate therapy with anti-hypertensive medications, especially medications that target the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, are often reasonable options. In summary, current recommendations include ongoing monitoring of the patient with at least yearly assessment of blood pressure and urinalysis. In patients with elevated blood pressure or urinary protein excretion, renal function should be assessed by obtaining a serum creatinine to estimate the glomerular filtration rate. In general, the long term outcome of unilateral renal agenesis or renal dysplasia is good when the contralateral kidney is normal. Serial renal ultrasonography should be used to assess compensatory growth of the contralateral kidney. It has also been suggested that ultrasonography measurements of parenchymal thickness can be used to augment monitoring of the development of the single kidney and may contribute to a more accurate assessment of any possible previously undetected or subtle anomalies of that kidney. For the patient in the vignette, intermittent monitoring throughout childhood and into adult life is the correct management option. While patients with an ectopic kidney may require specific assessment (eg, VCUG) and management, ectopic kidney is not the only renal anomaly that requires continued observation. As stated, all patients with a variety of urinary tract anomalies, regardless of the presence of hypertension or proteinuria, require continued observation.

      "recurrence Answer A This patient has the classic hemolytic uremic syndrome triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. Diarrheal-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (D+HUS) is most often caused by Shiga-(or verotoxin) producing Escherichia coli (STEC). E coli O157:H7 is the most common verotoxin- producing E coli (VTEC) serotype identified. Cows are the reservoir for STEC, and STEC is transmitted to humans by exposure to undercooked beef or unpasteurized apple juice, water, or vegetables that have been contaminated by manure. Person-to-person transmission can also occur, especially in outbreaks. Daycares may be a site of person-to-person transmission. Symptoms typically occur 3 to 8 days after exposure. Ten percent to 15% of those exposed will develop D+HUS; most often, D+HUS ensues 7 to 10 days after the symptoms begin. Risk factors for developing D+HUS after exposure to STEC include young or old age, antimotility agents, severe gastroenteritis, and female gender. Antibiotic administration may also increase the risk. Studies are limited, but it is estimated that there is 1 case of HUS per 50,000 patient-years for those younger than 18 years. The majority of D+HUS occurs in between April to September (spring to fall). The majority of cases occur in children younger than 5 years of age, with mean age near 2.4 years in many studies. Diarrhea may be bloody in up to 75% of cases. Nonbloody diarrhea does not preclude a diagnosis of diarrhea-associated HUS. Only 30% will present with fever, so fever does not differentiate between D+HUS and atypical HUS. Fifty percent to 70% may require dialysis and up to 3% to 9% mortality has been reported. The typical course of D+HUS may result in spontaneous resolution or improvement by approximately 11 days. However, long term effects on glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, and proteinuria may be present in up to 25% of patients. Up to 3% may develop chronic kidney disease stage 5. Severity of illness, duration of anuria, and elevation of the white blood cell count (> 20) are associated with a worse long term prognosis, but cannot distinguish D+HUS from atypical HUS. Approximately 10% of HUS cases are atypical (aHUS). Some non-diarrheal associated (D-) HUS is due to streptococcal pneumonia. Dysregulation of the alternative complement system, due to genetic mutations and/or antibodies to factor H, play a role in the development of aHUS. It is uncommon for D+HUS to present before the age of 1 year, and aHUS should be suspected in the very young. Atypical HUS can be triggered by viral infections. This may include viral gastroenteritis, making those cases difficult to distinguish from D+HUS, but often aHUS occurs in the absence of diarrhea. They can present at any time of year and there may be a family history of HUS. Patients may have a history of a previous episode of HUS. Onset may be more insidious, with a relapsing course and stronger component of hypertension. aHUS has a worse prognosis than D+HUS, with historical mortality of 25% and 60% to 70% progressing to CKD stage 5. Up to 10% to 30% of patients with aHUS will have neurologic involvement. The advent of complement directed therapy, eculizumab, has improved the prognosis of aHUS. While a family history of HUS is more common (but nevertheless unlikely) in aHUS, it would not provide a valuable clue to distinguish between these two entities. Both D+HUS and aHUS can occur at any age; therefore, patient age itself does not help differentiate these two entities. Fever may be present in both D+HUS and aHUS. Finally, recurrence is more likely with aHUS than D+HUS.

In children, a succinct definition of\nhypertensive crisis has not yet been developed.\nFor adults and children, acute hypertension or hypertensive crisis can be\nsubdivided into categories of hypertensive emergency and urgency. A\nhypertensive emergency is characterized by significantly elevated BP with\nevidence of end organ damage (eg, retinopathy). Patients also commonly\nreport various symptoms of high BP, including seizures, posterior reversible\nencephalopathy syndrome, focal or diffuse neurological deficit, symptoms of\ncongestive heart failure, mental status changes, headache, papilledema,\nblurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. A hypertensive urgency features\nsignificantly elevated BP, but without end organ damage. Patients may\n\ndevelop symptoms of high BP, but may also be asymptomatic. The\nincidence of hypertensive emergency and urgency in children is unknown.\nIn evaluating a child with hypertension, it is necessary to ascertain if the\nonset is acute or chronic, or acute exacerbation of chronic hypertension. For\npatients with a history of chronic hypertension, it is necessary to determine\nif the child has essential (primary, idiopathic) hypertension or a secondary\nform of hypertension. Patients with a history of more elevated BP are more\nlikely to have a secondary form of hypertension, while those with a history\nof mildly elevated BP are more likely to have essential hypertension.\nOther clues to consider in the evaluation of hypertension include age at\nonset. Hypertension with onset in the first decade of life is more likely to be\nsecondary, while hypertension with onset during the teenage years is more\nlikely to be essential, unless the blood pressure is significantly elevated.\nPrimary or essential hypertension is more likely to be associated with\nobesity, sedentary life style, and a positive family history for hypertension.\nThe most common cause of hypertensive emergency or urgency in children\nis renovascular or renal parenchymal disease, including acute\nglomerulonephritis. Other common causes include endocrine conditions (eg,\npheochromocytoma), collagen vascular disease (eg, systemic lupus),\nmedication use (eg, corticosteroids), cardiovascular (eg, coarctation of the\naorta), and drug use. In neonates and younger children, the most common\nconditions causing hypertensive crises include cardiovascular (eg,\ncoarctation of aorta), renovascular, and endocrine disorders. In older\nchildren and adolescents, renal parenchymal disease, endocrine disorders,\ndrug use, alcohol abuse, collagen vascular disease, and medications are the\nmost common etiologies.\n\nA renal ultrasonography is usually performed in the evaluation of the child\nwith acute hypertension and can determine if there is an anatomic cause of\nhypertension such as renal dysplasia, obstructive uropathy, or cystic kidney\ndisease, or detect abnormal renal blood flow, suggestive of renovascular\nhypertension. For patients with endocrine disorders, signs of catecholamine\nexcess such as palpitations, sweating, flushing, and tachycardia may\nstrongly suggest pheochromocytoma as the cause of the hypertension. An\nabnormal urinalysis with hematuria and proteinuria suggests a form of\nacute glomerulonephritis and further work-up of glomerular disease is\nindicated.\nThe gold standard for evaluation of renal artery stenosis is selective renal\nangiography, but it is invasive.

    "explanation": "D. Response D. Response D\nKidney stones are increasingly prevalent among children. Over the last\nquarter of a decade, the annual incidence of pediatric nephrolithiasis has\nincreased by 6% to 10% and is currently estimated to occur in as many as\n5 per 10,000 adolescents. The most common kidney stones in children are\ncalcium oxalate stones with an incidence of 45% to 65%. The other stones\nseen in children include calcium phosphate (24-30% incidence); cysteine\n(5-8% incidence); struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate; 7-13%\nincidence); uric acid (2-4% incidence); and miscellaneous (4% incidence).\nThe incidence of uric acid stones, however, increases substantially in hot,\narid climates because of the propensity to make low volume, acidic urine\nthat promotes the formation of uric acid stones.\nThe individual in this vignette has a kidney stone visualized on computed\ntomography (CT), but not plain film, which is classic for uric acid stones. In\naddition, he is obese, a known risk factor for uric acid nephrolithiasis. The\nmost important urine characteristic for uric acid stone formation is an acidic\npH because uric acid is insoluble in acidic environments. With a urine pH of\n7, most (95%) urinary uric acid is in the soluble form of urate. At a pH of 5,\nmost is in the insoluble, undissociated form of uric acid. (Table)\nThe second most important urinary characteristic for development of uric\nacid stones is a low urine volume that contributes to a high urine uric acid\nconcentration. Hyperuricosuria is not always present among individuals with\nuric acid nephrolithiasis. In fact, individuals with calcium oxalate stones\n\nhave been shown to have greater uricosuria than those with uric acid\nstones.\nThere are several clinical characteristics that predispose individuals to\ndevelop uric acid stones. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic\nsyndrome are associated with uric acid stone formation. The causal\nrelationship for this has not yet been fully elucidated, but it is thought to be\nrelated to reduced ammoniagenesis and decreased urinary pH. In addition,\nthe increased body mass index characteristic of both syndromes is\nassociated with a more acidic urine, increased uricosuria, and greater\nsupersaturation of uric acid.\nGout is another predisposing condition for uric acid nephrolithiasis, although\nthis is rarely seen in the pediatric population. Rare genetic mutations in\nrenal urate transporters, such as familial renal hypouricemia, can lead to an\nincreased fractional excretion of uric acid. In addition, Fanconi syndrome,\nintracranial disease, malignancies and inflammation, among other causes,\ncan lead to increased urate excretion in the urine. Increased uric acid\nproduction, via purine or urate overproduction, as can be seen with (1)\ninherited enzyme defects; (2) clinical disorders; (3) drugs or toxins; and (4)\ndiet can lead to a predisposition for uric acid stone formation. Finally, the\nvolume depletion and bicarbonate loss that occurs in children with chronic\ndiarrhea increases the risk for uric acid nephrolithiasis.\nThe clinical presentation of children with uric acid stones is similar to\nchildren with stones of other causes. Intermittent, colicky abdominal, flank,\nor groin pain (depending on the location of the stone), hematuria, and\nnausea or vomiting are the common symptoms bringing children to medical\nattention. Dysuria, fever, and malaise can also occur. The initial work-up for\nkidney stone should include a urinalysis and urine culture (when\n\napplicable). Imaging can often identify the stone, unless it has passed prior\nto presenting to medical attention. The preferred modality is\nultrasonography, however, a noncontrast spiral CT scan is an option if\nultrasonography is nondiagnostic or the diagnosis is in question.\nChildren with stones should be encouraged to strain their urine, capture the\nstone, and have it sent for biochemical analysis. A 24-hour urine collection\nfor stone risk analysis is essential to determine the type of stone, as that\nwill guide therapy and prevention. As mentioned, children with uric acid\nstones characteristically have a low urine volume, acidic urine (pH close to\n5), and can have hyperuricosuria. In addition, children can also have\nhypocitraturia. It is for these reasons that response choice D is the\npreferred answer.\nResponse choice A is suggestive of calcium oxalate stone formation: a low\nurine volume, elevated urine sodium excretion, hypocitraturia, and\nrelatively high calcium and oxalate excretion for the urine volume (which\nwould be better depicted in supersaturation levels that are not shown). As\nmentioned, hyperuricosuria is also a common finding among individuals\nwith calcium oxalate stones. This is because uric acid decreases calcium\noxalate solubility. In fact, calcium oxalate stones are more common among\nindividuals with hyperuricosuria than uric acid stones. For this reason,\nhyperuricosuria is considered an independent risk factor for calcium\nnephrolithiasis. Calcium-containing stones are visualized on plain film and,\nfor this reason, this is not the preferred response.\nResponse choices B and E reflect under- and overcollections, respectively,\nas evidenced by low and high 24-hour urine creatinine/kg excretion. This\nmakes the results difficult to interpret; however, in both instances, the\nurine pH is higher than would be expected for uric acid stones. Response\nchoice C is what would be seen with struvite stones. Struvite stones are\n\neither calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate stones that subsequently\nbecome infected with an urate-producing bacterium. With struvite stone,\nthe urease produced causes a reaction that leads to a urine pH of 8.5 or 9,\nvalues outside the physiologic range. These stones are usually quite large\nand visualized on plain film.\nIn the evaluation of patients with nephrolithiasis, in particular with a finding\nof a radiolucent stone (uric acid, cystine, xanthine), a qualitative test for\nurine cysteine, and testing for xanthine should also be performed.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\nKnow the clinical and laboratory evaluation of uric acid nephrolithiasis\n\nSuggested Readings\nFrassetto L, Kohlstadt I.

    "explanation": "C. acute kidney injury stage 3\nThe patient in this vignette meets the diagnostic criteria for acute kidney\ninjury (AKI) stage 3, based on the recently described Kidney Disease\nImproving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition and staging of AKI. This is\nevidenced by the documented increase in serum creatinine to greater than\n3 times the baseline value. There is no evidence for chronic kidney disease\nby ultrasonography and the serum creatinine at baseline was normal.\nAcute kidney injury has been traditionally defined as an abrupt loss of\nkidney function leading to a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR),\naccumulation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, and\ndysregulation of extracellular volume and electrolyte homeostasis. The term\nAKI has largely replaced acute renal failure (ARF) because the latter\ndesignation overemphasized the discrete event of a failed kidney. We now\nrecognize that AKI embodies both the continuum of renal dysfunction that\ncharacterizes the clinical spectrum, as well as the diverse molecular,\nbiochemical, and structural injuries to the nephron that occur well before\nthe decline in function. Therefore, AKI now includes both structural injury\nand functional impairment.\nMore than 35 different definitions of AKI have plagued the literature,\nresulting in a wide range of quoted incidence rates, risk factors, and\noutcomes. A major advance in the AKI field has resulted from the KDIGO\nAKI Consensus Conference, with the recommendation of a single definition\nof AKI based on serum creatinine and urine volume measurements:\n· Increase in serum creatinine by greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/dL (≥\n26.5 µmol/L) within 48 h; OR\n· Increase in serum creatinine to greater than or equal to 1.5 times baseline\n\nwithin the prior 7 days; OR\n· Urine volume less than or equal to 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 h\nThe KDIGO staging of AKI is shown in the Table.\nBoth the definition and staging include a 0.3 mg/dL (27 µmol/L) serum\ncreatinine increase criterion to specifically be applicable to pediatric AKI.\nThe staging also allows for a child with estimated GFR less than 35 mL/min\nper 1.73 m2 to be included in stage 3, in contrast with the adult criterion of\ngreater than or equal to 4 mg/dL (354 µmol/L) serum creatinine that would\nbe unusual in infants and young children.\nIt is recommended that the KDIGO AKI definition and staging be used to\nguide clinical care, and as a standardized inclusion and outcome measure in\nAKI studies.\nHowever, it is well recognized that the KDIGO AKI definition is largely\ndependent on changes in serum creatinine concentration, which is a flawed\nAKI biomarker for several reasons: serum creatinine does not differentiate\nthe nature, type, and timing of the renal insult. Changes in serum\n\ncreatinine concentrations often lag behind changes in GFR until a steady\nstate has been reached, which can take several days. Dialysis readily clears\nserum creatinine, rendering this marker useless in the assessment for\nimproving renal function once dialysis has begun. Even normal serum\ncreatinine can vary widely with age, gender, diet, muscle mass, nutrition\nstatus, medications, and hydration status. In the newborn, serum creatinine\nreflects maternal values for the first several days after birth. The KDIGO\ndefinition and staging may not be applicable to infants because of\nphysiologic changes in serum creatinine during the first few months of life.\nIn the acute setting, it is estimated that more than 50% of kidney function\nmust be lost before the serum creatinine even begins to rise.\nThe use of cystatin C as an endogenous marker of kidney function in\nchildren is well established. Cystatin C is a ubiquitous cysteine protease\ninhibitor protein that is produced by all nucleated cells at a constant rate,\nfreely filtered by the glomerulus, and catabolized by the proximal tubule. Its\nmeasurement is simple, standardized on a clinical platform, and widely\navailable. Plasma concentration of cystatin C is not affected by gender, diet,\nhydration, muscle mass, and age (cystatin C levels are nearly identical in\nadults and children older than 12 months of age). Cystatin C outperforms\nserum creatinine for estimation of GFR in adults and children, and has now\nbeen incorporated into the staging of chronic kidney disease. It is likely that\nfuture renditions of the KDIGO AKI definition and staging will include\ncystatin C measurements. In addition, novel biomarkers for the early stress\nresponse of the kidney have recently been identified, and are being\ndeveloped and validated as early noninvasive structural damage biomarkers\nfor the prediction of AKI and its clinical outcomes in humans. This is a\nrapidly evolving field. It is likely that validation and widespread clinical\n\nintegration of the novel AKI biomarkers will further improve our ability to\ndefine AKI in the near future.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\nKnow diagnostic criteria of acute renal failure\n\nSuggested Readings\nDevarajan P.

    "explanation": "D. prostaglandin E2\nAs compared to other organs, the oxygen tension in kidneys is lower, about\n5 mm Hg in the renal medulla and approximately 50 mm Hg in the cortex.\nThus, the renal medulla is in an environment of significantly reduced\noxygen tension, rendering it vulnerable to even minor perturbations in\nsystemic oxygen tension or renal blood flow (RBF). Most of the oxygen\ndelivered to the kidneys is utilized to fuel the various ATPases (eg, sodium-\npotassium, hydrogen) that mediate solute reabsorption and acid-base\nbalance. Oxygen is delivered by blood, therefore renal oxygenation is\ndirectly dependent on RBF. Indeed, increased demand for oxygen (ie,\nconsumption) is met by increases in RBF. However, the ability to increase\nRBF is limited, resulting in comparatively constant regional oxygen tensions.\nRenal hypoxia results from factors that reduce RBF or increase oxygen\ndemand (eg, for transport). In acute kidney injury (AKI), the medulla is\nparticularly vulnerable because of its lower oxygen tension. Acute kidney\ninjury disrupts renal tubular transport, particularly because the S3 segment\nof the proximal tubule and medullary thick ascending limbs (mTALs), which\nplay a major role in solute reabsorption, reside within the medulla.\nHowever, even the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal tubule, located\nwithin the cortex, are vulnerable to hypoxia because they are reliant on\nhigh rates of oxidative catabolism because those segments perform a large\nbulk of solute and water transport. In contrast, the distal tubule (eg, distal\nconvoluted tubule) primarily utilizes glycolysis for energy and can better\nsurvive hypoxic conditions. At the cellular level, the main goals in response\nto hypoxia are to reduce tubular transport (ie, demand), reduce\nmitochondrial respiration, and ameliorate oxidant activity (ie, generate\nantioxidants).\n\nAs mentioned, RBF is the major determinant of renal oxygenation. The\nmajor regulators of RBF are shown in the Table.\nIn response to hypoxia (eg, infarct), there is cell damage. Within hours of\nthe insult, there is cell swelling, loss of the brush border, increased\neosinophilia, nuclear pyknosis, and desquamation, followed by tubular\nnecrosis and increased thickening of the interstitium. In addition, when ATP\nlevels decline, the ATPases cannot operate at full capacity, resulting in\ndisrupted Na-K exchange, causing cell swelling and cell necrosis. Other\nalterations in cell function and metabolism include accumulation of cytosolic\ncalcium, increased degeneration of reactive oxygen species, and activation\nof various enzymes, including phospholipases, proteases, and\nendonucleases. These are the result of cell necrosis, but apoptosis also\noccurs. The main effect of reduced oxygen supply on the mitochondria is\ninhibition of the respiratory chain and an increase of the proton leak.\nAs described by Haase, the kidney has molecular sensors to aid in the\nrecognition of hypoxia. Within hours after hypoxia, adaptive responses\nensue to compensate for the insult. These responses occur rapidly and\n\npreferentially near the site of injury. First, cells turn to glycolysis to\ncompensate for low oxygen. Glycolysis can provide some energy for ATP\nproduction, but this may be limited, especially in the cortex. Another\nadaptive factor is the generation of the family of hypoxia-inducible\ntranscription factors (HIF) and their target genes (eg, heme oxygenase-1,\nor HO-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF). There are 2\nmajor HIF subunits, 1α and 2α. After hypoxia, HIF-1α is observed initially in\ntubular cells, while HIF-2 α is seen principally in peritubular interstitial cells.\nLater, HIF-1α is localized to the interstitium. In addition, cell proliferation\noccurs, including the generation of capillary endothelial cells, interstitial\ncells, and tubular cells. However, cell proliferation is not always protective\nand may induce tubular regeneration at the border of the hypoxic region,\nresulting in the development of fibrous tissue. There is also significant\nangiogenesis along the border of the hypoxic region.\nWhile the expression of HIF rapidly declines within 24 to 72 hours after\nhypoxia, its target genes (eg, HO-1, VEGF) may assume major roles in the\nongoing repair. It should be noted that while HIF triggers cell regeneration\nand proliferation, it likely also induces cell death, thereby removing cells\ndestined for demise. HO-1 actions are mediated by the radical scavenging\nbiliverdin and carbon monoxide, while VEGF plays a major role in\nangiogenesis.\nIt should be noted that hypoxia not only occurs in AKI, but also in chronic\nkidney disease (CKD) because of perturbations in the peritubular\nvasculature system. Hypoxia in CKD contributes to and accelerates the\nprogression of renal dysfunction and metabolic derangements.\nIn the vignette, prostaglandin E2 has a vasodilatory effect on afferent\narteriole, which will increase the glomerular blood flow. Adenosine and\n\nnorepinephrine decrease glomerular blood flow, thromboxane is a\nvasoconstrictor and facilitates platelet aggregation, and endothelin is a\nknown vasoconstrictor.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\nKnow the effects of hypoxia on cellular function and energy\n\nmetabolism\nSuggested Readings\nHaase VH.

    "explanation": "A. high urine citrate\nThere are many factors that predispose the formation of renal stones.\nThese include:\nsupersaturation\n\nreduced citrate or magnesium excretion\n\nlow urinary concentration of stone inhibitors such as osteopontin,\n\nnephrocalcin, Tamm–Horsfall protein, and glycosaminoglycans\ndecreased fluid intake and urine volume\n\nacidic urine (except for calcium phosphate stones, which precipitate in\n\nalkaline urine)\nhigh salt diet\n\nhigh protein diet\n\nincreased ingestion of food that contains high concentrations of\n\nsubstances that form stones (Table 1)\nIndeed, as shown by Asplin et al, urine from patients with the propensity to\nform stones features defects that promote increased nucleation (ie,\n\nformation of a solid crystal phase) and stone growth, caused by inability to\ninhibit stone formation.\nAs elegantly described by Basavaraj et al, stone formation occurs in phases.\nUrinary crystallization (nucleation) is the first phase of stone formation.\nDuring this phase, the supersaturation index (SSI) will significantly\ninfluence the stone formation rate. Indeed, if the SSI is less than 1, crystals\nwill dissolve, while a SSI greater than 1 promotes crystallization. The next\nphase in stone formation is crystal growth. The main stimulus for this phase\nis reduction in the potential energy (ie, motion) of the molecules as they\nattempt to form bonds, thereby easing the process for particle sticking and\nclumping. While surface charges on the molecules counteract these forces,\nthey may not be sufficient to inhibit or reverse the crystallization process.\nAggregation of crystals to renal epithelial cells is another crucial phase in\nstone formation. Once the crystal attaches to the renal epithelial cell, the\nlikelihood of stone formation dramatically increases. The tubule surface may\ncontain a friendly or hostile environment for adherence of the crystals to\nthe tubule surface, depending on the local environment.\nStone inhibitors such as nephrocalcin and glycosaminoglycans generally\nachieve their objective by increasing the threshold for nucleation, impairing\ncrystal growth rate and aggregation, and inhibiting secondary nucleation.\nIndeed, even in the absence of other risk factors for stone formation,\nreduced concentration or ability of stone inhibitors predisposes to stone\nformation. While some stone inhibitors (eg, osteopontin,\nglycosaminoglycans) inhibit all phases of stone formation, others (eg, renal\nlithostathine, citrate) only inhibit 1 phase.\nLow urinary citrate promotes kidney stone formation. Urinary citrate binds\nurinary calcium in a nondissociable but soluble complex. Citrate prevents\n\ncalcium from binding to oxalate or phosphate. In most patients,\nhypocitraturia is idiopathic. Kidney diseases that are associated with low\ncitrate levels are type I (distal) renal tubular acidosis, medullary sponge\nkidney, polycystic kidney disease, and metabolic acidosis associated with\nmalabsorption or ureteral diversion.\nFor the patient described in the vignette, among the substances listed,\ncitrate would most likely result in reduced calcium stone formation. Sodium\npromotes, not inhibits stone formation. Uric acid stones are a risk factor for\nthe development for calcium stone formation, therefore uric acid would not\nbe an inhibitory substance for calcium stone formation in this child. As\nmentioned, a high protein (eg, meat) diet promotes, does not inhibit, stone\nformation. Finally, calcium oxalate stones are more likely to form (ie, be\nless soluble) in an acidic urine. For this patient, strategies to reduce the\nlikelihood of future calcium oxalate stones are shown in Table 2.\nRisk factors for calcium nephrolithiasis include:\nLow Urine Volume\n\nHypercalciuria\n\nIdiopathic\n\nHigh sodium intake\n\n\nLoop diuretics\n\nHyperparathyroidism\n\nRenal tubular acidosis\n\nHypocitraturia\n\nType I (distal) renal tubular acidosis\n\nMedullary sponge kidney\n\nPolycystic kidney disease\n\nMetabolic acidosis\n\nHyperoxaluria\n\nDiet\n\nCalcium restriction\n\nMalabsorption\n\nHyperuricosuria\n\nUrine pH\n\nStone dependent\n\nHyperuricosuria\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\nUnderstand the processes that prevent urinary crystallization\n\nSuggested Readings\nAsplin JR, Parks JH, Chen MS, et al.

    "explanation": "E. proteinase 3\nThe patient in vignette has granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), which was\npreviously called Wegener granulomatosis (WG). Granulomatosis with\npolyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that involves only small- and medium-size\nvessels. GPA and other similar vasculitides are considered pauci-immune\nnecrotizing vasculitides. This is in contrast with other small vessel vasculitides\n(eg, Henoch-Schönlein purpura), which are characterized by cell-mediated\nimmune reactions to antigens and reveal circulating immune complexes and\ndeposits.\nClinically, GPA results in the development of vascular disease and\ninflammatory granulomas in the respiratory tract, peripheral vasculature, and\nkidneys. The classic diagnostic triad of GPA includes necrotizing granulomas,\nmucosal inflammation, ulceration of the respiratory tract, focal necrotizing\nvasculitis, and nephritis featured by focal, necrotizing glomerulitis, fibrinoid\nnecrosis, thrombosis of the capillary loops, with inflammatory elements.\nIn GPA, circulating antibodies called cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic\nantibodies (C-ANCA) attack small- and medium-size blood vessels and react\nwith proteinase 3 (PR3). Most (90%) patients with GPA are positive for PR3-\nANCA, while few (10%) are positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA. A\npathogenetic role for ANCA in the development of GPA has been extensively\nexplored. In vitro studies show that once activated, neutrophils adhere to\nendothelial cells, resulting in endothelial damage, highlighted by endothelial\ndetachment from the vessel wall. Falk et al showed that these neutrophils\n\nexpress PR3 on their surface when primed with low dose pro-inflammatory\ncytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). When these neutrophils are\nincubated with sera containing PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA, they release\nreactive oxygen species and lytic enzymes. In addition, the pro-inflammatory\ncytokines TNF-α and interleukin-8 induce the translocation of PR3 to the cell\nsurface of neutrophils. Neutrophils are likely activated by ANCA via various\nsignal transduction pathways, including F(ab')2-fragments, Fc γ receptor\n(FcγR) interactions, FcγRIIa (blockade of FcγRIIa with monoclonal antibodies\nprevents ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation), FcγRIIIb, and G proteins,\nalthough a definitive role for these transduction pathways remains elusive.\nRecent studies suggest a role for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the\ndevelopment of renal disease and in vitro studies show that PR3-ANCA\ninduces NETs, but in vivo confirmation is required.\nThe clinical evidence also suggests a prominent and central role for ANCA in\nthe pathogenesis of GPA. Boomsma et al have shown that ANCA antibody\ntiters commonly increase immediately prior to increased disease activity, and\nobtaining surveillance titers has been demonstrated to help predict relapse of\ndisease. While most healthy individuals have some neutrophils that positively\nexpress PR3, patients with GPA have a significantly higher percentage of PR3-\npositive neutrophils, and the increased expression of PR3 is predictive of\nrelapse frequency.\nThere is also evidence, though less robust than seen with PR3-ANCA, for a\nrole of T cells and monocytes in pulmonary and renal cell infiltrates. In vitro\n\nstudies show that mononuclear cells from patients with GPA can proliferate in\nresponse to stimulation by PR3.\nThere is emerging evidence for a genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of\nGPA. Most recent studies have focused on various polymorphisms. As\nreviewed by Csernok and Gross, the most compelling evidence for a genetic\nrole is for HLADPB1*040. Other potential genetic factors include HLA-DPB4,\nHLA-DP, SERPINA1, and PRTN3. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis most\ncommonly occurs in white patients, but has been reported in blacks and\nHispanics. In addition, a study from the Netherlands reported a significant\ndecrease in the frequency of HLA-DR13/DR6 among patients with GPA in\ncomparison to controls.\nThere are also potential environmental factors associated with the pathogenesis\nof GPA and other small vessel vasculitides, including viruses or bacteria (most\nconvincingly Staphylococcus aureus), inhaled substances, and exposure to\nsilica and drugs. Finally, there is some evidence of hypersensitivity based on\nthe development of granulomas, inflammation, and the presence of eosinophils\nin the affected tissues. This theory is supported by a study of children with\nGPA, in which the majority had a history of at least 1 type of allergy.\nThe patient in the vignette has GPA. Among the factors listed, the most\nprominent role is for PR3. The FcγRIIIb receptor likely plays some role in the\nneutrophil cascade, as supported by some genetic studies of GPA, but the\nextent of involvement of this receptor remains to be elucidated. Neutrophils,\nnot mononuclear cells, are the key component mediating the effects of PR3-\nANCA. While MPO plays a role in some patients with GPA, the vast majority\n\nof patients are PR3, not MPO, positive. Finally, despite some recent exciting in\nvitro studies, the in vivo role for neutrophil extracellular traps in GPA is\nlargely unexplored.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\nKnow the pathophysiology of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and\n\nmicroscopic polyangiitis\nSuggested Readings\nCsernok E, Gross WL.

    "explanation": "C. Cuprophan dialyzer\nThe risk of adverse reactions during hemodialysis requires constant vigilance\nduring the procedure. Part of the inherent risk of the treatment is the potential\nbioincompatibility between the patient’s blood and dialyzer membrane, the\ntubing, dialysate, and other therapeutics given during a treatment.\nHemodialysis-induced leukopenia, which was initially described in the 1960s,\nis less common these days because of the dialysis membranes being used\ncurrently. Leukopenia was seen regularly with first use of cellulose-based\nmembranes like Cuprophan®, occurring almost immediately after treatment\nand with recovery (and often an increase) of the white blood cell count upon\nconclusion of dialysis.\nCellulose-based membranes are composed of repeating polysaccharides, which\nare similar in structure to bacterial wall lipopolysaccharides and, as such, are\nmore likely to cause an inflammatory reaction when first used. The evolution\nof dialyzer membranes saw modification to cellulose, often replacing the\nhydroxyl (-OH) moieties with acetate or amine (-NH2) moieties, making the\nmembranes more biocompatible. Now, synthetic membranes, like\npolyacylnitrile (PAN), polysulphone (PS), and polyamide, are polymers of\nother chemical compounds that are biocompatible and do not cause this type of\nreaction. Synthetic membranes are also thought to better adsorb some of the\ncomponents of the inflammatory response and cause less overall activation.\nLeukopenia occurs because neutrophils are sequestered in the pulmonary\nvasculature, which improves after a period of time. Blood coming into contact\n\nwith an incompatible membrane stimulates complement activation via the\nalternate pathway (C3b and C5a levels are increased, not C4a). Complement\nactivation, in turn, leads to increased expression of adhesion receptors by\nneutrophils and their subsequent adhesion to the endothelium of the lung\ncapillaries (likely also in the kidneys, just not apparent in patients on dialysis)\nand to other neutrophils. This congestion in the pulmonary capillaries leads to\nsome degree of pulmonary hypertension and hypoxemia that is clinically\napparent, but tends to be only transient in nature, peaking around 15 min, but\ncompletely reversing both the leukopenia and hypoxemia by 2 hours after\ninitiation of the dialysis treatment.\nThe sequestration of neutrophils, though appearing to be innocuous, is not\nwithout risk. While “trapped” in the pulmonary vasculature, the neutrophils\nrelease their lysosomal contents as their inflammatory response has been\nshown to be decreased to a greater degree in patients dialyzed with cellulose-\nbased membranes compared to synthetic membranes. The cumulative effect of\nneutrophil activation over time may also shorten life spans of patients dialyzed\nwith cellulose-based membranes.\nThis once common reaction was attenuated, though not completely eliminated,\nwith reuse of the cellulose-based dialyzer and cooling of the blood. These\nmeasures lead to decreased complement activation by the membrane. Citrate\nanti-coagulation was also thought to attenuate leukopenia, potentially through\nthe chelation of calcium, but studies comparing citrate to standard heparin anti-\ncoagulation showed no difference on measured white blood cell, granulocyte,\nor complement activation product counts. The increased use of synthetic\n\n(biocompatible) dialyzer membranes, which do not cause leukopenia, has\nmade this phenomenon now rare.\nOther types of incompatibility reactions, though, may still be seen with\nhemodialysis membranes. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)\ninhibitors with negatively-charged PAN membranes may cause a\nhypersensitivity reaction. This reaction is likely bradykinin-mediated and\ncauses dyspnea, anxiety, urticaria, pruritus, or even anaphylaxis, but not\nleukopenia. This reaction is best treated emergently with stopping the\ntreatment and disposing of the blood and membrane while supplemental\noxygen, anti-histamines, steroids, or epinephrine may need to be administered,\ndepending on the severity of the reaction. This reaction may be avoided by\neither discontinuing the ACE inhibitor, using a different (non-PAN) dialyzer,\nor priming with buffered solution, as the kinin release does not seem to occur\nwith a higher pH (> 7) of the blood when it comes into contact with the\nmembrane. Similarly, membranes sterilized with ethylene oxide may produce a\nsimilar reaction, possibly immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated, which is best\navoided with better rinsing of the membrane or use of other sterilizing agents.\nContamination of medications given during dialysis may also cause allergic\nreactions within minutes of exposure to the medication. Exposure to\ncontaminated heparin, given as a bolus at the initiation of the treatment, has\nbeen associated with a myriad of allergic symptoms, ranging from the minor\n(tingling, flushing, sweating, nausea, rash) to anaphylactic shock. Again, as\nthis reaction is primarily IgE-mediated, leukopenia would not be seen.\n\nComplications related to the hemodialysis procedure itself, not related to\nbiocompatibility, may also present with respiratory symptoms. Hemodialysis\npatients are at risk of thrombus formation, especially if their vascular access is\nvia a central venous catheter. Inadequate anti-coagulation could contribute to\nthis risk and they may present with findings of resistance to flushing of the\ncatheter or high access pressure readings. Embolization of a thrombus from the\ncatheter could occur at any time during a treatment, but is more likely after\nflushing of the catheter ports, like what may be done at the initiation of\ntreatment. Pulmonary emboli may be symptomatic with shortness of breath,\nchest pain, or hypoxemia. Complete blood cell count results are often normal,\nincluding platelet counts, however, a D-dimer assay has a high sensitivity for\npulmonary embolism, up to 99% in some studies. Normal baseline D-dimer\nlevels are elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease, even in the absence\nof thrombosis.\nAir embolism may also occur at any time during a hemodialysis treatment\nwhen there is discontinuity within the circuit, such as a disconnection of or\nhole in the dialysis tubing. However, there are many safeguards built into the\ndialysis circuit to avoid its occurrence, such that it is rare. In a seated patient,\nthe air that enters the venous circulation may backflow up into cerebral venous\nsystem, causing an audible sound to the patient of air in his vessels and\npotential loss of consciousness and seizures. In a recumbent patient, air that\nenters the patient’s venous circulation could travel to the right side of the heart\nthen to the lungs. Symptoms would include chest pain, shortness of breath,\nhypoxemia, and significant coughing, while the foam formed from the\ninterface of the air and blood in the right side of the heart causes a loud\n\nchurning murmur over the precordium. Depending on the amount of air that\nenters, this may be a clinical emergency that requires a prompt response to\navoid embolization to the brain, lungs, or the left side of the heart. Placing the\npatient in the Trendelenburg position with their left side down may trap the air\nin the right side of the heart to avoid other sequelae. The white blood cell\ncount should be unaffected, or if anything, elevated from a stress response in\nthis condition.\nPREP Pearls\nHemodialysis-induced leukopenia occurs because of the biologic\n\nincompatibility of cellulose-based dialyzer membranes with blood, causing\ncomplement activation and subsequent sequestration of neutrophils in the\npulmonary vasculature. The leukopenia was transient, however, not\npersisting past the second hour of treatment.\nThis leukopenia could be ameliorated by reuse of the cellulose dialyzers, but\n\nwas not modified by using different anti-coagulation. This phenomenon is\nnow seen rarely, as synthetic dialyzers are much more prevalently used and\ndo not cause this incompatibility reaction.\nPolyacylnitrile (PAN) membranes may also cause a dialyzer reaction when\n\nused with patients taking angiotensin-converting enxyme inhibitors. This\nreaction, though one of incompatibility, is related to kinin release and\npresents with allergic symptoms ranging from minor (urticaria, pruritus) to\nlife-threatening (anaphylaxis).\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\nUnderstand the pathophysiologic principles behind hemodialysis-induced\n\nleukopenia\n\nSuggested Readings\nHakim RM, Himmelfarb J.

      "polycystin Answer E The patient in this vignette has clinical phenotype of large kidneys with multiple cysts and family history of cystic kidney and hypertension, which fits in with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The most common form of polycystic kidney disease is ADPKD and remains one of the most common monogenic diseases. Patients with this disease usually have progressive cyst formation resulting in large kidneys. Progression to end stage kidney disease occurs in most patients. Genetically heterogeneous, ADPKD has 2 genes identified thus far, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding polycystin 1 and 2, respectively. PKD1 has been mapped to chromosome 16p13.3 and PKD2 to 4q22. PKD1 accounts for almost 75% of pedigrees and PKD2 for 13%, with the remaining cases having no mutation detected. PKD1 mutation is associated with more severe clinical disease. Moreover, truncating mutations of PKD1 are associated with earlier onset of end stage renal disease when compared to nontruncating mutations. Polycystin-1 (PC1) is a 600 kDa receptor protein with a large ectodomain and a cytoplasmic tail. Polycystin-2 (PC2) is a transmembrane cation channel. PC1 and 2 interact via their C–terminal tails forming a PC complex that is thought to play an important role in intracellular calcium (Ca) regulation. The PC complex is found in the primary cilia, making PKD one of the ciliopathies. Primary cilium functions as a flow detector, controlling Ca influx in response to flow. However, the precise function of PC complex on the primary cilia is still unresolved. Also, what is unclear is how mutations of PKD1 or PKD2 lead to pleomorphic cystic phenotype. Therefore, the treatments that have been tested currently address more downstream secondary mechanisms rather than the primary PKD1 or PKD2 mutation or expression of PC1 or PC2. Considerable progress is being made in understanding the development of cystic phenotype. The key factors that seem to play a role are listed in the Table. Of the choices listed in the vignette, the most appropriate would be polycystin, as the gene defect in ADPKD leads to alteration in polycystin as described. Meckelin is the protein that is defective in Meckel-Gruber syndrome, which is a recessively inherited condition characterized by renal cysts, occipital encephalocele, polydactyly, and biliary dysplasia. Fibrocystin is the protein defective in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, which features large kidneys and microcysts rather than large cysts as described for the patient in the vignette. Elastin abnormalities have been described in Williams syndrome in which patients may have renal cysts in addition to hypertension, neonatal hypercalcemia, and supravalvular aortic stenosis. Nephrocystin abnormalities lead to nephronophthisis type 1, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by polyuria, anemia, and chronic kidney disease in late childhood and early adolescence, but is not associated with large renal cysts.

Fetal urine becomes the major source of amniotic fluid by the second trimester. Adequate amniotic fluid is absolutely essential for normal pulmonary development. The most common cause of oligohydramnios detected in the early second trimester prenatal ultrasonography is a congenital anomaly of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). In this vignette, with bilaterally enlarged kidneys, a likely etiology for the oligohydramnios is autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. A number of conditions comprise CAKUT that collectively account for the most common causes of prenatal anomalies and are listed in the Table. The primary consequence of severe oligohydramnios is Potter syndrome, resulting largely from fetal compression. Physical features include low set ears, wide set eyes, small chin, and club feet. The most important clinical consequence is pulmonary hypoplasia, which results from both compression of the chest wall, as well as the reduced movement of amniotic fluid through the developing lungs. The degree of pulmonary hypoplasia is usually the limiting factor that determines postnatal survival. The other responses are incorrect. There is no bladder dysgenesis and no renal dysplasia that is apparent or expected based on the current prenatal ultrasonography. Oligohydramnios does not result in agenesis of the gastrointestinal tract. Given the severity of oligohydramnios and renal enlargement so early in gestation, normal fetal development is unlikely.

      "send genetic testing for Gordon syndrome Answer D Hyperkalemia is a common reason for pediatric nephrology consultation. Normal values can vary by laboratory, and can also vary by age, making interpretation of raw numbers difficult without clinical context. According to the Harriet Lane Handbook, normal values for potassium are shown in the Table. The neonate in the vignette is preterm, born at 35 weeks estimated gestational age, making his observed potassium level within normal limits. The higher normal ranges in premature and term infants compared to older children and adults are related to their need to remain in a state of positive potassium balance. This positive balance is essential to maintain somatic growth, which is much more rapid in the infant compared to the older child and certainly the adult. Older children and adults, on the other hand, have a different potassium homeostasis goal. They aim to maintain a zero potassium balance; to achieve this, 90% to 95% of their daily dietary load is eliminated in the urine, with the rest eliminated in stool. To meet these different potassium requirements of fetal life and infancy, the kidney has adapted to allow for this positive potassium balance. The fractional excretion of potassium in a newborn is half that seen in adults. This is because of both decreased potassium secretion by the collecting duct and to increased potassium absorption by the medullary collecting duct, even when clearance rates are corrected by the lower glomerular filtration rate observed in newborns. In the adult kidney, potassium is freely filtered at the glomerulus, 65% is reabsorbed by the proximal tubule, roughly 25% is reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb of Henle, leaving approximately 10% presented to the cortical collecting duct (CCD). The principal and intercalated cells of the CCD are then responsible for the fine-tuning needed to maintain potassium homeostasis. In the neonatal kidney, instead of being presented with 10% of the filtered potassium load, the CCD is presented with 35% of the filtered load. Despite this, the neonatal kidney is able to maintain a positive potassium balance because of the decreased secretory capacity of the principal cells and increased reabsorption by the intercalated cells. Indeed, unlike CCD isolated from adult rabbits, which display high rates of net potassium secretion, microperfused CCD isolated from newborn rabbits do not reveal any potassium secretion until 3 weeks of life. Since the CCD is the final segment where potassium regulation occurs, its role in providing a more positive potassium balance in the newborn is essential. The CCD has 2 cell types: principal cells and intercalated cells. Intercalated cells are mainly responsible for acid-base transport and balance, although they may participate in K absorption, while principal cells are mainly responsible for Na absorption and K secretion. The fine tuning of potassium balance in the CCD relies on the opposing processes of potassium secretion and reabsorption as stated previously. Potassium secretion relies on 3 actions in the principal cell: Na uptake at the apical (luminal) membrane via apical epithelial Na channels (ENaC), cellular extrusion of Na and uptake of potassium via the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase, and luminal secretion via renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK)-encoded ATP-sensitive secretory potassium (SK) channels on the apical membrane. The ROMK is considered to be the major subunit of the SK channel. The potassium flux into the urinary lumen is facilitated by the negative electrochemical gradient enhanced by Na uptake via apical ENaC channels. Essential to K secretion, therefore, is Na reabsorption to generate the appropriate electrochemical gradient and K channels to allow for passive transport into the lumen. The neonatal kidney has a paucity of these ROMK-encoded K channels, which is what primarily contributes to diminished K secretion until several weeks of life, when transcription and translation of these channels is increased. Interestingly, while Na reabsorption is vital for K secretion, the relatively high net rates of Na absorption do not explain the retention of K in the newborn. While patch-clamp analysis reveals a scarcity of ROMK/SK channels in the first weeks of life, studies show abundance of apical hydrogen, potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+,K+-ATPase) in intercalated cells in the CCD. Indeed, K reabsorption in the distal nephron is accomplished by these H+/K+-ATPase channels. This enzyme in the apical membrane is highly active in the neonatal kidney allowing for significant absorption of K. In addition to these processes, the newborn kidney excretes less potassium because of decreased tubular flow rates and relative hyporesponsiveness to aldosterone. Over time, the neonatal kidney matures and is exposed to increased distal flow, increased tubular surface area, increased Na+/K+- ATPase activity, and an increased sensitivity to serum aldosterone. All of these maturational changes result in an increase in potassium excretion over time. The observed potassium value of the neonate in the vignette is within normal limits therefore, administration of sodium polystyrene sulfate is not necessary, nor is it required to assess urine and blood indices to aid in an investigation for causes of hyperkalemia. While correcting metabolic acidosis will certainly aid efforts in correcting hyperkalemia when present, the serum bicarbonate level in the vignette is also within normal limits for a preterm neonate and does not require therapy. Gordon syndrome (pseudohypoaldosteronism type II), an autosomal dominant disorder secondary to mutations in WNK1 or WNK4, is characterized by hypertension sensitive to thiazide diuretics, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. The neonate in the vignette does not have these findings for the reasons stated.

Subendothelial deposits are signs of activity in lupus nephritis and the pattern of distribution decides the class of lupus nephritis; if focal, it is classified as class III and, if diffuse and global, it is classified as class IV. In lupus nephritis, the predominant electron dense deposits are granular. Sometimes, these deposits may be partially organized, exhibiting fingerprint or lattice-like substructures. This may be present in isolation or more commonly as a portion of otherwise granular deposits, especially in the larger subendothelial deposits. The finger print substructure, which was first described by Grishman et al in 1967, consists of curved arrays of 2 to 6 parallel dark bands alternating with light bands arranged around a center, producing a configuration that mimics a fingerprint. The structures resemble some tubular deposits regularly identified in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, suggesting that they may represent cryoglobulins. In fact, several cases of lupus nephritis with a mixed immunoglobulin G/immunoglobulin A/immunoglobulin M cryoglobulin exhibited the same fingerprint substructures in ultrastructural study of glomerular deposits. Such deposits are also seen in monoclonal cryoglobulinemia. It appears that the finger print deposits are not specific for lupus, but reflect the composition of the associated immune deposits. However, Hvala et al have shown that fingerprint deposits were demonstrated in only 2 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with cyroglobulinemia, whereas they were present in 30 patients with SLE without cryoglobulinemia. The authors concluded that fingerprint deposits are characteristic, diagnostically relevant for SLE, and morphologically represent a homogeneous group of organized deposits unrelated to cryoglobulins. Fingerprint substructures may also be identified in the subepithelial deposits associated with class V lupus; however, they are not seen with idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy. Duplication of the basement membrane can occur in membranous nephropathy however, duplication is not seen in the attached figure. Tubuloreticular inclusions consist of interanastomosing tubular structures, which are located in the dilated cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum. However, they are not consistent with the appearance of the electron microscopy (EM) picture depicted in the vignette. Hematoxylin bodies are morphologically similar to the lupus erythematosus cell, with a central nuclear component and a surrounding cytoplasmic aggregate, and are often seen within a large phagocytic vacuole of a monocyte or mesangial cell. The appearance in this case vignette is not consistent with hematoxylin body. Foot process effacement can also occur either in isolation or in combination with other class of lupus nephritis, however, the EM does not show this feature. PREP Pearls • In lupus nephritis, the predominant electron dense deposits are granular.

      "spherocytosis is common in both types Answer B Distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is associated with mutations in at least 4 genes. Both autosomal dominant and recessive forms are associated with nephrocalcinosis. Only the recessive forms are associated with hearing loss. Autosomal dominant disease may be caused by mutations in the SLC4A1 gene. Recessive disease is most common and can be caused by mutations in ATP6V1B1, ATP60A4, CAII, and SLC4A1. The solute carrier 4 anion exchanger (SLC4A1) is associated with hereditary red cell shape abnormalities (spherocytosis) and distal RTA. This anion exchanger is a membrane glycoprotein expressed in the kidney and red cells. Mutations in the transmembrane domain results in distal tubular acidosis whereas mutations in the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain may be associated with spherocytosis. Interestingly, the coexistence of spherocytosis in distal RTA is uncommon. The phenotype is typically autosomal dominant presenting as a partial or complete distal RTA. Nephrocalcinosis and kidney stones may develop. Deafness does not develop. Some patients have been reported to have autosomal recessive distal RTA in a complete form with mutations in the SLC4A1 gene. In these patients, ovalocytosis and hemolytic anemia is expected. Distal RTA caused by ATP6V1B1 (β-1 subunit of the hydrogen ATPase) mutations results in failure to thrive and is typically diagnosed by 1 year of age. Patients have nephrocalcinosis and many develop mild to profound hearing loss. Renal function is generally normal. Mutations in ATP60A4, which encodes the α subunit of the apical hydrogen ATPase vacuolar proton pump, may cause distal RTA in an autosomal recessive pattern. These patients generally have severe metabolic acidosis, sometimes with rickets. Nephrocalcinosis is a known complication; hearing is usually preserved early in life but later hearing loss may occur. Carbonic anhydrous II (CAII) is a zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the formation of H+ and HCO- from CO2 and water. Mutations in CAII have been identified to cause autosomal recessive renal tubular acidosis with osteopetrosis and cerebral calcifications. This type of RTA has also been called marble bone disease. Additional findings are development delay, conductive hearing loss, and the RTA may be distal or mixed proximal and distal types. As to be expected, most of the cloning studies for recessive diseases involve consanguineous families. In addition, some ancestry groups show increased incidence of specific mutations. For example, ovalocytosis with hemolytic anemia and distal RTA is most commonly seen in patients with southeast Asian ancestry (AR SLC4A1). The type of hearing loss may assist in determining the type of mutation. Mutations in the CAII result in conductive hearing loss. Mutations in the apical hydrogen ATPase (ATP60A4 and ATP6V1B1) may result in sensorineural hearing loss. There may be a tendency for early hearing loss in the ATP6V1B1 mutations versus later hearing loss with ATP60A4 mutations; however, since the phenotype may overlap, this does not help differentiate between the two in any patient. (Table) Aminoaciduria is found in some forms of proximal, not distal renal tubular acidosis. Aminoaciduria occurs because of defects in specific amino-acid transporters expressed in the proximal tubule.

      "NPHS2 mutations are more commonly seen in childhood versus adult onset steroid-resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis",
      "specific genetic mutations usually result in distinct morphological focal segmental glomerulosclerosis phenotypes Answer D There are a number of well described genetic forms of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Collectively, these account for a significant proportion of patients with steroid-resistant disease. Findings suggestive of genetic FSGS include a family history of FSGS and disease onset in infancy or early childhood. Thus, a detailed family history is of paramount importance in the evaluation of such patients. Genetic causes of FSGS may be familial and transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern with variable penetrance, as an autosomal recessive disorder, or sporadic. Genetic and sporadic forms of FSGS are both linked to mutations in key podocyte proteins including the slit diaphragm, cytoskeleton, signaling, basement membrane adhesion, mitochondrial function, and development. Specific apolipoprotein L1 alleles also confer increased risk of developing FSGS through a currently unknown mechanism. It is also important to note that specific podocyte-related genetic mutations do not result in distinct morphological phenotypes of FSGS, signifying that additional modifying factors influence disease phenotype. Examples of mutations in key podocyte proteins that may be associated with FSGS include: Podocyte slit diaphragm proteins NPHS1 gene - Mutations in the gene for nephrin cause congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) of the Finnish type. Nephrin is a primary component of the slit diaphragm. Congenital nephrotic syndrome inheritance is autosomal recessive and Fin minor and Fin major forms of CNS are described. However, NPHS1 mutations have also been identified in older children with FSGS and in at least 1 adult with FSGS. NPHS2 gene - Mutations in the gene for podocin usually result in early onset nephrotic syndrome with presentation at 6 years of age or younger. Some affected patients have milder disease and present in adolescence or young adulthood. The presence of a specific variant, R229Q, may be associated with moderately increased albuminuria in the nondisease general population. Familial inheritance is autosomal recessive. Podocin affects the expression and location of nephrin in the slit diaphragm. Some mutant forms of the NPHS1 and NPHS2 genes result in intracellular retention of the abnormal proteins that may be amenable to targeted drug therapy. Patients with the NPHS2 mutation less commonly develop FSGS recurrence after transplantation than patients with sporadic disease. CD2AP gene - CD2AP is a glomerular protein found at the slit diaphragm. Its main roles are to regulate structure of the cytoskeleton and stabilize the slit diaphragm. Mutations in the gene for CD2AP have been described in patients with primary FSGS. Inheritance may be autosomal dominant, recessive, or may occur in a sporadic manner. Podocyte cytoskeleton proteins α-actinin-4 gene - Mutations in the α-actinin-4 gene are associated with an autosomal dominant form of FSGS. The mutant form of α-actinin-4 binds to actin more strongly than the wild type protein, suggesting that the disease might be caused by an alteration in the actin cytoskeleton of glomerular podocytes. The FSGS resulting from mutations in the α-actinin-4 gene may be associated with electron-dense podocyte aggregates. The collapsing glomerulopathy has multiple etiologies, including mutations in the α-actinin-4. The collapsing glomerulopathy, as seen in the patient in the vignette, represents a morphologic pattern of disease, characterized histologically by glomerular capillary collapse, severe podocyte injury, and glomerular epithelial cell proliferation, and clinically by marked proteinuria and renal insufficiency. INF2 gene - The INF2 gene encodes a member of the formin family of actin-regulating proteins. Inheritance may be autosomal dominant or occur in sporadic disease. INF2-associated FSGS usually presents in adolescence or early adulthood. MYO1E gene - Two mutations in the gene MY01E, which encodes a nonmuscle class I myosin, myosin 1E, have been associated with autosomal recessive FSGS. Myosin 1E is needed for normal actin cytoskeleton function. SCARB2 gene - Mutations in the scavenger receptor class B member 2 protein, a putative lysosomal receptor, are associated with FSGS, sometimes of the collapsing variant. SMARCAL1 gene – The protein is involved in chromatin bundling and gene transcription. Mutations are usually associated with autosomal inheritance of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia. However, childhood FSGS is also described. Podocyte-signaling proteins TRPC6 gene - The canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) ion channel is a member of the calcium-permeable cation channel family. TRPC6 cosegregates to the slit diaphragm with nephrin, podocin, and CD2AP. Alterations in TRPC6 function impair podocyte structure and function. Gain of function mutations for the TRPC6 gene are present in familial and nonfamilial forms of FSGS. In familial FSGS, mutations in the TRPC6 gene segregate in an autosomal dominant fashion. PLC ϵ1 gene - Phospholipase ϵ1 podocyte differentiation and signaling present as either autosomal recessive FSGS or diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS). PTPRO gene – Mutations in tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO; also known as glomerular epithelial protein-1 [GLEPP1]) are associated with ultrastructural alterations including diffuse foot process fusion and extensive microvillus transformation of podocytes by electron microscopy. Recessive inheritance of gene mutations in PTPRO is associated with the occurrence of FSGS. ARHGDIA gene – The Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1 is involved in RHO GTPase signaling and influences actin dynamics. Mutations are described in childhood FSGS. Podocyte basement membrane adhesion proteins MYO1E gene - Mutations in the MYO1E gene protein may result in decreased motile behavior of human podocytes and mislocalized expression of the MYO1E protein. These types of mutation are linked to a childhood onset and glucocorticoid-resistant form of FSGS. LMX1B gene - LMX1B gene encodes for the LIM homeobox transcription factor 1-β that is important in podocyte and basement membrane development. Mutations in LMX1B are usually associated with the nail-patella syndrome, however, rarely, mutations may result in FSGS without apparent extrarenal manifestations. LAMB2 gene - The laminin β2 chain interacts with integrin α3β1 that links the glomerular basement membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. Mutations of laminin β2 chain impair this interaction. Inheritance is autosomal recessive and results in Pierson syndrome or FSGS. ITGB4 gene - Mutations of the integrin β4 cell-matrix adhesion protein are rarely associated with FSGS. CD151 gene – The CD151 protein is involved in podocyte and glomerular basement membrane laminin-integrin interactions. Mutations are associated with childhood FSGS and with deafness. Podocyte mitochondrial function proteins Mutations of the following mitochondrial genes may be associated with occurrence of FSGS: COQ2 gene - (polyprenytranferase mitochondrial function, results in deficient Co Q10) COQ6 gene - (ubiquinone biosynthesis monooxygenase COQ6 ubiquinone biosynthesis) PDSS2 gene - decaprenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 2, coenzyme Q10 synthesis) ADCK4 gene - (aarF domain-containing protein kinase 4, coenzyme Q modulation) MTTL1 gene - (mitochondrially encoded tRNA leucine 1, mitochondrion tRNA) Podocyte development gene proteins WT1 gene - The Wilms tumor protein is required for normal podocyte development. Mutations in the Wilms tumor gene are associated with autosomal dominant FSGS, sporadic FSGS, and with DMS. Other genetic disorders associated with FSGS include adult onset cystinosis, Denys-Drash syndrome, Frasier syndrome, progeria, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency. The child in the vignette had rapidly progressive FSGS caused by a mutation in the α-actinin-4 gene. The inheritance is autosomal dominant, resulting in the collapsing variant of FSGS. Mutations in NPHS2 are most commonly seen in younger patients, especially children younger than 10 years of age, and much less commonly in patients with adult onset FSGS. While mutations in the LMX1B gene may cause nail-patella syndrome, FSGS without extrarenal manifestations may also be seen. As noted, specific mutations do not usually result in distinct morphological phenotypes of FSGS. Finally, while CD2AP plays important roles by regulating cytoskeletal structure and stabilizing the slit diaphragm, integrins and dystroglycans help anchor podocyte foot processes to the glomerular basement membrane. Additional genetic susceptibilities that might increase the severity of the resulting injury after second hits include drug-induced injury, infection, or the maladaptive alterations that occur after loss of kidney parenchyma. These maladaptive processes include hemodynamic alterations, increased growth factors, and oxidative stress.

The newborn has been growing and feeding adequately on expressed breast milk. Routine\nblood testing today reveals a serum phosphate of 7.5 mg/dL (2.42 mmol/L). The resident is concerned\nabout the high phosphate level.\nOf the following, the MOST likely explanation for the observed laboratory finding is",
    "options": [
      "chronic kidney disease",
      "high fractional reabsorption of phosphate",
      "high phosphate content of breast milk",
      "immaturity of renal phosphate transport systems",
      "low glomerular filtration rate due to immaturity Answer B In contrast to the majority of renal transport systems, the fractional reabsorption of phosphate is greater in the immature and neonatal mammal than it is in the adult. Enhanced tubular reabsorption of phosphate is required to maintain a positive phosphate balance that characterizes early extra- uterine life. It represents an appropriate physiologic adaptation to the high demands for phosphate during rapid extra-uterine growth. Intracellular phosphate is required for many biological functions including energy metabolism, protein synthesis, and enzyme action. In the newborn, approximately 90% of the filtered phosphate load is reabsorbed. This is in contrast with adults, in whom less than 80% of the filtered load is normally reabsorbed. Indeed, Spitzer and colleagues originally showed that the newborn kidney reabsorbs phosphate at rates about 2-fold higher, with a 4.5-fold higher maximal capacity (Vmax), than that seen in the adult kidney. Phosphate reabsorption occurs primarily in the proximal tubule, mediated by a sodium-dependent cotransport system located on the apical membrane. At least 2 isoforms of the Na+-phosphate co-transporter populate the proximal tubule, encoded by distinct genes (NPT1 and NPT2, also termed type I and type II, respectively). The NPT1 protein is homogeneously distributed along the brush border membrane of the proximal tubule, whereas the NPT2 protein is concentrated in the S1 segment. There are 3 isoforms of the NPT2 transporters: (NPT2a (IIa), NPT2b (IIb) and NPT2c (IIc). The NPT2c isoform is the rate-limiting transporter during development and is regulated by changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and dietary phosphate. Despite the relative structural immaturity of the neonatal proximal tubule, enhanced phosphate uptake occurs primarily as a result of a dramatically greater apical membrane density of the Na+-phosphate cotransporter. It should be noted that evidence to date shows no role for the type III NaPi transporters (Glvr-1 and Ram-1) in the high rates of proximal tubule NaPi reabsorption during rapid development. Sodium is required for phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Sodium first binds to the Na+- phosphate cotransporter, which induces a conformational change to increase affinity of the transporter for phosphate. The Na+-phosphate-transporter complex is then translocated to the interior of the cell, followed by dissociation of sodium and phosphate and recycling of the transporter. Thus, the increased apical membrane abundance of the Na+-phosphate cotransporter contributes to the positive balance of both phosphate and sodium and thereby enhances neonatal somatic growth. The rate-limiting step in the movement of phosphate across the cell is the apical transport of phosphate into the cell. Other factors that might be responsible for the higher phosphate reabsorption by the neonatal kidney include differences in hormonal regulation and dietary factors. The developing mammal is relatively insensitive to the phosphaturic effect of PTH, but can display enhanced phosphate reabsorption in response to dietary phosphate depletion. While both 1,25 vitamin D3 and fibroblastic growth factor-23 are important regulators of renal NaPi cotransport, their role during early development has not been elucidated. The other responses provided in the vignette are incorrect. There is no evidence that this newborn has chronic kidney disease, and a serum phosphate concentration of 7.5 mg/dL is within normal limits during the newborn period. While the glomerular filtration rate is low in premature and newborn babies compared to older children, this does not account for the physiologic renal retention of phosphate observed in the vignette. The phosphate content of human breast milk is exceptionally low, and indeed, premature infants fed with breast milk require fortifiers containing phosphate to meet daily phosphate requirements.

      "thickening of glomerular basement membranes and spikes and domes seen on Jones staining Answer C The patient in this vignette presents with recurrent episodes of gross hematuria associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, a clinical presentation most consistent with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most prevalent primary chronic glomerular disease. In North American cohorts, the male-to-female ratio is about 2:1, while in Asia, this ratio is approximately 1:1. The clinical presentation of IgA nephropathy is variable. Some patients present with acute nephritic syndrome, while acute renal failure or nephrotic syndrome are much rarer presentations. In North America, the majority of children and young adults with IgA nephropathy present with recurrent macroscopic hematuria during upper respiratory or gastrointestinal illnesses. However, in populations where this disease is routinely screened for, as in Japanese children, the majority with IgA nephropathy are initially detected with microscopic hematuria. Recurrent gross hematuria can also occur with hereditary nephritis, including Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane disease, or with Nutcracker syndrome. Nutcracker syndrome is secondary to compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery before the left renal vein joins the inferior vena cava; this leads to the left renal vein hypertension. Rupture of the vein into the calyceal fornix causes recurrent episodes of hematuria. However, these episodes are associated with flank pain. A family history of microscopic or gross hematuria, chronic kidney disease, or progressive sensorineural hearing loss strongly suggests hereditary nephritis. However, the definitive diagnosis rests on findings of ultrastructural changes on the renal biopsy. The diagnostic hallmark of IgA nephropathy is the predominance of IgA deposits, either alone or with immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, or both, in the glomerular mesangium. The histological features of IgA nephropathy (figure) are varied, ranging from minimal abnormalities and no proliferative activity in early disease to crescentic lesions in cases with acute renal failure. The most characteristic abnormality is mesangial enlargement caused by various combinations of hypercellularity and increased matrix. Compared to the histology in adults with IgA nephropathy, biopsy findings in children with IgA nephropathy reveal more hypercellularity. Figure 1 shows mesangial hypercellularity with arrow showing more than 3 cells per mesangial area while Figure 2 shows IgA Mesangial staining with IgA deposits with immunofluorescence. Initial histological classifications of IgA nephropathy such as Lee or Haas attempted to include extent of involvement (similar to World Health Organization classification of lupus) and components of tubular and interstitial involvement. However, there were significant limitations of the Lee and Hass classifications, including the fact that each of the classifications included both active and chronic lesions in the same category and that the Lee classification scheme used many descriptive (eg, nonspecific) terms. In order to establish an evidence-based and reproducible pathological classification of IgA nephropathy, over 40 nephrologists and nephropathologists worked together to publish the Oxford classification of IgA nephropathy. Important facts about the Oxford classification system include: · The schema was based on a retrospective clinicopathological study of 265 patients · The cohort included adults and children · Inclusion criteria included proteinuria greater than 0.5 g/L per 24 h and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the time of diagnosis · Follow-up duration of greater than 12 months · Exclusion criteria included patients who progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 1 year of presentation, and those diagnosed with Henoch–Schönlein purpura nephritis · 2 principal end points: rate of loss of renal function (that is, the slope of the estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) and renal survival (end stage kidney disease [ESKD] or a 50% decrease in the GFR) at the end of follow-up. These criteria generated the MEST (mesangial hypercellularity [M], endocapillary hypercellularity [E], segmental glomerulosclerosis [S], and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis [T]) for the Oxford classification (Table). Though several studies in adults with IgA nephropathy have shown that the Oxford classification seems valid in predicting renal outcomes, questions remain about the system. The chief drawback in the Oxford classification is that it excluded patients who quickly progressed to ESKD and therefore the pathological significance of crescents may have been obscured. A few pediatric studies that have attempted to validate the Oxford criteria seem to indicate the importance of including crescentic glomerulonephritis as a predictor of outcome. Increased fraction of galactose deficient hinge region of IgA1 plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy. Increased levels of such IgA1 are also present in first degree relatives, suggesting genetic factors also playing a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Indeed, familial cases of IgA nephropathy have been reported with autosomal dominant inheritance observed in most of the kindreds. However, a specific mutation remains to be identified. Henoch-Schönlein purpura has close pathological similarity to IgA nephropathy, however it is still not very clear whether these two entities have similar pathogenesis. Diffuse mesangial IgA deposits can also be seen in celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, dermatitis herpitiformis, cystic fibrosis, neoplasms such as colon and lung cancers, mycosis fungoides, as well as in chronic liver disease. In the vignette, the clinical presentation is most consistent with IgA nephropathy; the histological findings would typically show mesangial proliferation and 3+ IgA staining in all glomeruli. Fibrocellular crescents with negative immunofluorescence signifies a pauci-immune process such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody vasculitis, which does not usually present with recurrent gross hematuria or normal renal function. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or minimal change nephrotic syndrome rarely present with gross hematuria and certainly not with recurrent gross hematuria. Since the clinical and laboratory presentations are most consistent with IgA nephropathy, one would not see normal histology, negative immunofluorescence, with only podocyte effacement on electron microscopy. Membranous nephritis, featured by thickening of the glomerular basement membranes and spikes and domes seen on Jones staining, does not present with recurrent gross hematuria.

The treatment consists of\ns\nboth calcium and vitamin D supplementation (Table 2).\nTable 2.

In non-emergent situations, oral supplementation is recommended. Intravenous therapy is\n\nused for infants and children with acute presentations with bradycardia, prolonged QT interval, congestive heart\nfailure, hypotension, laryngospasm, tetany, or seizures. In these situations, calcium gluconate (10%) may be\ngiven over 10 to 15 minutes (min) through a well-functioning intravenous line to prevent any extravasation,\nwith close monitoring of the electrocardiogram. In the presence of both hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, it\nis often necessary to administer the intravenous magnesium sulfate (50%) over a 10 min period in order to help\nimprove serum calcium concentrations.\nThe response choices A, C, D, and E for the vignette are incorrect. An increased urine calcium–to–creatinine\nratio and serum phosphorus concentration is consistent with an abnormal renal tubular response to PTH level.\nGranulomatous disease is associated with increased serum calcium concentration, a normal–to–increased serum\nphosphorus, increased urine calcium–to–creatinine ratio, a normal or decreased PTH, and an increased calcitriol\nconcentration. In vitamin D deficiency, the serum phosphorus and calcium concentrations are decreased with an\nelevated PTH. Primary hypoparathyroidism has a decreased PTH and a high serum phosphorus concentration.\nPREP Pearls\n Decreased serum phosphorus concentrations, increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) and decreased urine\ncalcium–to–creatinine ratio SUGGEST vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D dependent rickets type 1, or vitamin D\ndependent rickets type 2. They differ based on vitamin D levels.\n Increased serum phosphorus concentrations, increased 1,25 hydroxylvitamin D levels, and increased urine\ncalcium–to–creatinine ratios SUGGEST hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism. They differ based\non PTH levels.\n Hypomagnesemia is associated with decreased PTH and 1,25 hydroxylvitamin D concentrations.

She has been given a home remedy and has developed signs and symptoms of dehydration, central\nnervous system dysfunction, and neuromuscular irritability. Her primary problem is the use of baking soda as a\nhome remedy. This has resulted in metabolic alkalosis with associated chloride depletion, hypokalemia, and\nhypocalcemia. She has a low respiratory rate to compensate for the metabolic alkalosis. Her symptoms are\ncaused by alkalosis and associated electrolyte disturbances. She had hypocalcemic tetany during blood pressure\ncuff inflation.\nThere are many causes for metabolic alkalosis. In some conditions, metabolic alkalosis is initiated when both\nchloride and potassium are lost (potassium and chloride in the diarrhea of villous adenoma), whereas in others,\nthe loss of chloride and sodium (use of diuretics) leads to urinary potassium wasting, increased bicarbonate\nreabsorption, and increased urinary ammonia excretion (net acid excretion). Important causes of metabolic\nalkalosis are given in the Table.\nTable.

Metabolic alkalosis. J Am Soc Nephrol.\n2000 Feb;11(2):369-75.\nPatients with metabolic alkalosis usually have a positive history (excessive vomiting, diarrhea, medications) and\nclinical signs (tetany). In patients with metabolic alkalosis, measurement of urinary chloride and potassium\nbefore therapy allows segregation of causes that help patient management. Patients with a urine chloride of less\nthan 10 mEq/L (10 mmol/L) (chloride-sensitive metabolic alkalosis) benefit from normal saline administration,\n\nwhere as those with an urine chloride of greater than 20 mEq/L (20 mmol/L) (chloride-resistant metabolic\nalkalosis) do not benefit from saline administration.\nSimilarly, extrarenal potassium loss is suspected when urinary potassium is less than 20 mEq/L (20 mmol/L),\nwhereas urinary potassium wasting is present when it is greater than 30 mEq/L (30 mmol/L), for example, in the\nsetting of hyperaldosteronism.\nIn this vignette, the history of a “home remedy” for heartburn would lead to consideration of the use of calcium\ncarbonate or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). The use of calcium carbonate could lead to “milk-alkali\nsyndrome,” which is hypercalcemia and alkalosis caused by over-ingestion (and inability to excrete) of calcium\nand base. The symptoms can include gastrointestinal complaints (constipation, abdominal, pain, vomiting),\naltered mental status, and weakness. These patients also have hypercalcemia in addition to alkalosis.\nThe misuse of baking soda as a home remedy is common, with 192 cases reported to California poison control\nfrom 2000 to 2012. Children may be especially susceptible and its use is not recommended in children younger\nthan 5 years of age. Although a majority of ingestions were for gastrointestinal symptoms, a significant number\nwere related to the use of baking soda in an attempt to pass urine drug screens.\nAdditional Readings\nPREP Pearls\n The signs and symptoms of metabolic alkalosis are nonspecific.\n Hypokalemia and chloride loss are common causes of metabolic alkalosis.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the clinical manifestations and presentation of metabolic alkalosis\nSuggested Readings\n Al-Abri SA, Kearney T.

    "correct_index": 1,
    "explanation": "B. daily intermittent hemodialysis will have a lower daily clearance than continuous renal replacement therapy\nMolecules amenable to removal in dialytic modalities are most often small and water-soluble. Substances\nmeeting these criteria are present in the plasma water and readily diffusible, making them good candidates for\nclearance by dialysis. As molecules increase in size, clearance by diffusion decreases, although removal by\nconvection may be maintained up to the cut-off size of the membrane. In addition to molecular size, other\nfactors related to the interaction between the substance and the patient may hinder dialytic removal:\n Protein binding. Molecules bound to protein (eg, albumin) will not be cleared by dialysis. Only the free fraction\nwill be available for removal. Higher levels of protein binding will restrict clearance further. Increasing grades of\nconvection will not improve clearance of highly protein-bound molecules, as the proteins themselves exceed the\ncut-off size of the membrane, even when using highly porous filters (CRRT, high-flux dialysis). One should note\nthat because the free fraction is available for removal, there will be some clearance of substances with a high\ndegree of protein binding, assuming the free molecule meets the criteria for dialysis (smaller molecules\ndissolved in the plasma water). Therefore, the amount of clearance depends on the percentage of protein\nbinding (higher percentage yields lower free fraction and lower clearance). Clearance also depends on the\nduration of the renal replacement procedure (ongoing equilibration between the protein-bound fraction and the\nfree fraction during longer sessions will slowly deplete the protein-bound reservoir).\n Intracellular distribution. Analogous to the processes noted with protein binding, molecules that distribute into\nthe intracellular compartment will not be immediately available for removal by dialysis. Rather, only that\nproportion in the extracellular (specifically vascular) compartment is considered “dialyzable.” Drugs with high\nvolumes of distribution (ie, distributed throughout the intracellular and extracellular compartments) may have\nhigh intracellular concentrations. Drugs that remain confined to the plasma will exhibit a volume of distribution\nsimilar to plasma volume, while those which distribute more widely will demonstrate a volume of distribution\nsimilar to that predicted for the body compartment in question. In general, volume of distribution <0.2 L/kg\nsuggests a drug restricted to plasma, 0.2-0.5 L/kg implies distribution in extracellular fluid, 0.5-0.7 L/kg suggests\ndistribution in the total body water, and values >0.7 L/kg imply distribution of the drug into compartments\noutside of total body water. Of note, if the extracellular fraction is amenable to dialysis, blood levels may drop\nsignificantly with a dialysis procedure, only to rise again after dialysis with re-equilibration from the intracellular\npool (rebound effect).\n Solubility in lipid. Highly lipophilic molecules will distribute into fat in much the same way that other molecules\nwill distribute into cells. This phenomenon is well known to have an effect on pharmacokinetics. Lipid\nsequestration of drug similarly limits removal by dialysis and such drugs are also prone to rebound effect.\nVolume of distribution will tend to be higher for lipophilic substances as this represents a compartment outside\nof the total body water. Highly lipid soluble molecules tend to be relatively hydrophobic, thus limiting the\nreadily dialyzable proportion dissolved in plasma water.\n Red blood cell binding. Some drugs will partition into erythrocytes in a manner similar to entry into other cells.\nThis may limit the dialyzable fraction available in the plasma water. Movement into erythrocytes may be\nenhanced during ultrafiltration, as this will cause hemoconcentration and a more favorable gradient for cellular\nentry of drug.\nChanging the method of renal replacement may also have an impact on molecular clearance. Intermittent\nhemodialysis is most often prescribed in a manner that makes mass transfer more efficient than that seen in\nCRRT. However, extended duration of CRRT may increase total daily clearance of many substances, including\ndrugs. Protein binding and cellular partition may further change the level of clearance with a given modality.\nFor a molecule that is highly sequestered (eg, tight protein binding, large volume of distribution into cells),\n\nintermittent hemodialysis will only remove a proportion of the available fraction; molecules in the sequestered\nor partitioned fraction may not undergo sufficient re-equilibration into the dialyzable space during the 2- to 4-hr\nsession to permit any additional clearance. By contrast, CRRT may take 2 to 3 times longer to remove the same\nquantity of substance, but ongoing continuous therapy may provide the equivalent of multiple sessions within a\n24-hr period. Throughout this timeframe, molecules in the partitioned fraction will equilibrate with the available\nfraction, maintaining a higher gradient for clearance. Consequently, total daily clearance in CRRT is likely to be\nhigher.\nIn the vignette, the patient requires renal replacement therapy, but is receiving a drug for which clearance would\nideally be kept to a minimum. The drug is small, roughly the same size as creatinine, and has a relatively low\nvolume of distribution, which should make it amenable to clearance by any renal replacement modality.\nHowever, protein binding is relatively high at 75%; this will limit dialyzability, but will not preclude clearance\ncompletely, as the free fraction (25%) will be available for removal. Modalities employing diffusion or\nconvection should function relatively equally with a small molecule; convection demonstrates superior\nclearance for larger molecules that diffuse poorly but will not be advantageous for a molecule bound to a\nprotein that is larger than the hemofilter pores and fully reflected at the membrane. Therefore, it is unlikely that\nany form of CRRT would provide substantially different clearance than another. Intermittent hemodialysis\nwould likely have a lower total daily clearance than CRRT because of shorter session length and insufficient\ntime for re-equilibration during the intermittent procedure. If the overall clinical status will permit, intermittent\nhemodialysis may be the preferred modality to limit clearance of the investigational drug.\nPREP Pearls\n Molecules with high protein binding, large volumes of distribution, or that are highly lipophilic are less amenable\nto removal by renal replacement therapy.\n Even molecules with limited dialyzability due to binding or partitioning will have some level of dialyzability from\nthe free plasma water fraction.\n Extended modalities such as CRRT may achieve higher clearance of partitioned molecules per day because of\nprolonged session times.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the importance of drug binding and partition characteristics upon their removal by dialysis\nSuggested Readings\n Sefer S, Degoricija V.

    "explanation": "D. Plasmapheresis\nFor the boy in this vignette, with evidence of acute rejection and positive staining for C4d in peritubular\ncapillaries, it is important to fully assess for diagnosis of antibody mediated rejection (ABMR). The recently\nupdated Banff 2013 Schema for Diagnosis of Antibody-Mediated Rejection in Renal Allografts includes new\nconsensus criteria for diagnosing antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) in the presence and absence of\ndetectable C4d deposition. The diagnosis of acute/active ABMR requires 1) histologic (microvascular\ninflammation, intimal/transmural arteritis, acute thrombotic microangiopathy or acute tubular injury), 2)\nevidence of antibody interaction with endothelium (linear C4d staining in peritubular capillaries, moderate\nmicrovascular inflammation or evidence of increased endothelial activation genes), and 3) serologic evidence of\ndonor specific antibodies (DSAs). The patient’s DSA status completes the diagnosis and provides a marker for\nthe treatment response and course over time. Thus a designation of C4d-negative ABMR is now acceptable as\nlong as the Banff 2013 criteria are met.\nIn general, initial treatment for ABMR would likely include intravenous corticosteroids. However, observation\nof the response of ABMR to intravenous corticosteroids alone is no longer standard of therapy. Indeed, the\nresponse to intravenous corticosteroids alone is so poor that additional treatment steps are always employed,\nalthough increased corticosteroids form the foundation for all of the escalated treatment approaches. Based on\nthe severity of histologic findings, presence and titer of DSA, and local center preference, therapeutic options\nfor ABMR might include 1) plasmapheresis, 2) change in maintenance immunosuppression, and/or 3)\nintravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG). Rituximab (anti-CD20 cell therapy) and immunoadsorption appear to\nbe effective in clearing circulating DSA and may also be pursued in some circumstances. Angiotensin\nconvertase inhibitors may have some role in minimizing progressive renal injury in chronic types of ABMR but\nhave no role in treatment of acute ABMR. Increased tacrolimus, which acts principally through both blocking T\ncell transduction and IL-2 transcription, would not positively affect the outcome of ABMR. While rapamycin\nor other TOR inhibitor may have some beneficial effect on decreasing B cell activity, they are not effective in\ntreatment of acute/active ABMR. Therefore, for the child in the vignette, the best next step is to initiate\nplasmapheresis.\nMore recent studies have documented evidence of specific anti-donor antibodies in up to 20% to 30% of all\nacute rejection episodes in renal recipients. ABMR is associated with circulating antibodies to donor human\nleukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, class II, or non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen on\nendothelium. In the past, ABMR largely went undiagnosed, due to a lack of reliable morphological and\nimmunohistochemical markers to analyze renal allograft biopsy. Acute ABMR has a poorer prognosis than\nacute cellular rejection and is generally less responsive to conventional anti-rejection therapy. One-year graft\nsurvival rate following ABMR varies from 15% to 50%, despite intensive conventional immunosuppressive\n\ntherapy. Introduction of immunostaining for C4d as a marker of antibody deposition in rejecting renal allografts\nsignifies a major advance in the diagnosis of ABMR.\nClassification of ABMR is based on the temporal relationship to transplantation, the underlying\npathophysiology, and the clinical setting. The most useful classification relies on the temporal onset of ABMR\nfindings in relation to time of transplant (Table 1).\nTable 1. Types of Antibody Mediated Rejection (ABMR)\nType Timing Mechanism\nHyperacute Rejection Within first 24 hr of transplantation Pre-formed DSA\nAcute ABMR After first 24 hr, usually within first yr DSA develop early after\nof transplantation; may occur later in transplantation\nnon-adherent patients\ndesensitized patients\nunder-immunosuppressed\nnon-adherent\nChronic ABMR Usually occurs > 1 yr after DSA develop late\ntransplantation\nunder-immunosuppressed\nnon-adherent\nDSA = donor-specific antibodies, usually to HLA class I, class II or non-major\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens on the donor endothelium.\nMuch remains to be defined about the best approach to treatment of ABMR. Hyperacute ABMR has the worse\nresponse to treatment and often demonstrates no response. In patients with acute-ABMR (A-ABMR), after\ndesensitization treatment there exists better responses to treatments that those patients with denovo A-ABMR.\nMany of these patients respond to plasmapheresis and/or IVIG treatment, accompanied by intravenous\nmethylprednisolone.\nPediatric studies are limited to small case series, but there are reports of good outcomes in some children with\nA-AMR treated with combinations of intravenous methylprednisolone, increased maintenance\nimmunosuppression, plasmapheresis, IVIG, or rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody therapy).

The normal concentration of inorganic phosphate in adults is 2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL (0.81-1.45\nmmol/L), while that of children varies with age, with higher levels observed in infancy (4.8-7.4 mg/dL). The\nconcentration of serum phosphate fluctuates: there is a mean diurnal variation with a nadir at 11:00 AM,\nsubsequently rising to a plateau at 16:00 PM, and peaking in the early evening. The plasma concentration is\ndetermined by dietary intake (in which about two-thirds of the intake is absorbed), intestinal absorption, renal\ntubular reabsorption, and shifts between the intracellular (mainly bound to proteins and lipids) and extracellular\nspaces.\nThere are 3 major mechanisms by which hypophosphatemia can occur (Table): decreased intake or reduced\nintestinal absorption, internal redistribution (shift from the extracellular to intracellular space), and increased\nurinary loss.\nTable. Causes of Hypophosphatemia.\nLow intake or decreased Severe protein energy malnutrition\nSecretory diarrhea\nintestinal absorption\nSteatorrhea\nUse of phosphate binders or antacids\nCrohn disease\nCeliac sprue\nVitamin D deficiency\nInternal redistribution Refeeding syndrome\nRespiratory alkalosis\nDiabetic ketoacidosis recovery\nHungry bone syndrome\nIncreased urinary excretion Parathyroid (hormone) excess\nProximal renal tubular abnormality (Sodium and phosphorus\ntransporter, heavy metal exposure)\nHypophosphatemic rickets (eg, PHEX gene)\nVitamin D resistant rickets\nPost-kidney transplantation\nVolume disorders: Osmotic diuresis/acute volume expansion\nMedications: loop diuretics, bisphosphonates, cisplatinum, ifosfamide\nA selective deficiency of phosphate in the diet is unusual because of its ubiquity. Protein-rich foods (like milk\nproducts, eggs, red meat, poultry, fish) and cereal grains are rich sources of phosphate. Therefore, only in severe\ncases of malnutrition would one observe hypophosphatemia. One condition in which dietary intake may be the\n\netiology of hypophosphatemia would be during refeeding. In addition, malabsorption or a low vitamin D level\nmay also feature hypophosphatemia.\nAn acute shift in phosphate from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment is primarily responsible for\nthe lowering of the serum phosphate as a result of redistribution. The most frequent cause of this redistribution\nof phosphate is the intravenous administration of glucose with concomitant release or administration of insulin,\nwhich increases the cellular uptake of glucose and phosphate. Most of the uptake occurs in the liver and the\nskeletal muscle. Refeeding syndrome that occurs in malnourished patients and in anorexia nervosa when\naggressive feeding regimens are put in place may also feature shifts. Similarly, the plasma phosphate level falls\nwhen diabetic ketoacidosis is treated with insulin.\nUnder steady-state conditions, the kidney is the most important regulator of the serum phosphate level.\nPhosphate is freely filtered across the glomerulus, and 80% to 90% of the phosphate is reabsorbed by the renal\ntubules. Sixty percent to 70% of this reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule via a sodium gradient-\ndependent process. Two hormones play an important role in renal phosphate handling: parathyroid hormone\n(PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Both hormones have hypophosphatemic effects by decreasing\ntubular phosphate reabsorption, but opposite effects on the regulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Parathyroid\nhormone activates 1,25 vitamin D, which in turn increases intestinal phosphate and calcium absorption.\nParathyroid hormone also increases calcium mobilization from the bone, thereby increasing serum calcium\nlevels. Fibroblast growth factor 23 exerts its effect via binding to its obligatory cofactor klotho, resulting in\ninhibition of 1α hydroxylase; therefore, it inhibits hydroxylation of 25 vitamin D to 1,25 vitamin D. However,\ndespite this effect, it has minimal effects on serum calcium.\nThe conditions that cause low serum phosphorus without affecting serum calcium level would be either internal\nredistribution (which reduces serum phosphorus without altering calcium level) or increased urinary losses of\nphosphorus. These 2 conditions can be differentiated either by clinical scenario or measuring the fractional\nexcretion of phosphorus (FE = urine phosphorus/serum phosphorus//urine creatinine/serum creatinine %). In\npi\nconditions of urinary losses, the FE would be greater than 5% in the setting of hypophosphatemia, while the\npi\nurinary excretion of phosphate would decrease with redistribution. Conditions that stimulate PTH production\nwould simultaneously cause hypophosphatemia (via increased urinary losses) elevated levels of 1,25\ndihydroxyvitamin D levels and hypercalcemia. In contrast, isolated hypophosphatemia would be due to\nconditions causing excess FGF23 levels or altered sodium or phosphorus receptor. Suppressed level of 1,25\ndihydroxyvitamin D level provides the additional clue that excess FGF23 is responsible for hypophosphatemia\n(Figure).\n\nFigure: Differential diagnosis of hypophosphatemia when serum calcium is normal\nLow serum\nphosphorus with\nLow serum normal serum calcium\nphosphorus with\nnormal serum calcium Low serum\nLow serum\nphosphorus with\nphosphorus with\nnormal serum calcium\nnormal serum calcium\nLow serum Low serum\nphosphorus with phosphorus with\nnormal serum calcium normal serum calcium\nThe age of onset of hypophosphatemia provides clues to the etiology. In general, hypophosphatemia occurring\nin infants and small children should prompt consideration of genetic or inherited causes, while onset during\nlater childhood or adolescence should raise a strong suspicion of an acquired disorder. Most patients with\nhypophosphatemia are asymptomatic. Younger patients may exhibit poor growth, bowing, bone pain, or even\nfractures. If chronic, some patients may exhibit weakness or malaise.\nThe patient described in the vignette has hypophosphatemia in the immediate post-transplant period. His serum\n1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D level is low, in spite of good renal function. While calcineurin inhibitors may\ncontribute to hypophosphatemia, belatacept and sirolimus have not been described to cause hypophosphatemia.\nOver expression of PTH certainly could cause hypophosphatemia, but would also cause hypercalcemia.\nFibroblast growth factor 23 excess has been shown to cause post-transplant hypophosphatemia without altering\nserum calcium, while suppressing 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels and therefore is the likely cause in this\nsituation. In contrast, FGF23 receptor blockage, under expression of klotho and PTH inactivation, would cause\nhyperphosphatemia. In the immediate post-transplant period, other factors that influence phosphate excretion\ninclude urine flow, sodium excretion, and medication use.\nPREP Pearls\n There are 3 major mechanisms by which hypophosphatemia can occur: decreased intestinal absorption, internal\nredistribution, and increased urinary loss.\n Hypophosphatemia caused by urinary losses can be due to parathyroid hormone (PTH) or fibroblast growth\nfactor 23 (FGF23) excess. Conditions that stimulate PTH would cause alternations in calcium, whereas FGF23\nexcess or alteration of sodium or phosphorus receptor would not alter serum calcium.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the differential diagnosis of hypophosphatemia when serum calcium is normal\n\nSuggested Readings\n Bacchetta J, Salusky IB.

    "explanation": "D.\nhyponatremic encephalopathy\nHyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration less than 135 mEq/L (135 mmol/L). With a\nprogressive fall in the serum sodium concentration below 135 mEq/L (135 mmol/L), the signs and symptoms of\nhyponatremia worsen as a result of fall in the extracellular fluid osmolality: serum soldium less than 125 mEq/L\n(125 mmol/L) leads to nausea and malaise while serum sodium less than 120 mEq/L (120 mmol/L) leads to\nagitation, headache, lethargy or malaise, vomiting, emesis, decreased deep tendon reflexes, disorientation,\nseizures, and coma.\nThe most common causes of hyponatremia result from increased extracellular free water and impaired renal\nwater excretion, volume contraction (extrarenal or renal losses, adrenal causes), clinical euvolemia with\nstimulation of antidiuretic hormone secretion (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, or\npostoperative state), and volume expansion secondary to kidney failure, congestive heart failure, or nephrotic\nsyndrome. Depending on the study, the incidence of hyponatremia in hospitalized children ranges from 5% to\n45%.\nArginine vasopressin (AVP) contributes both to increased urine osmolarity and decreased free water excretion.\nArginine vasopressin increases water permeability in the distal nephron by mediating the insertion of water\nchannels (aquaporin 2) into the apical membranes of the distal tubule and collecting duct, allowing water\nmovement down the osmotic gradient across the nephron segments into the extracellular fluid compartment.\nParadoxically, even in patients with hyponatremia, plasma AVP levels are not always suppressed, which may be\nattributed, at least in part, to the presence of nonosmotic stimuli for antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release.\nConversely, with excessive volumes of free water intake (intravenous or oral) in the presence of increased AVP\nsecretion, hyponatremia develops because of retention of extracellular free water.\nIn this vignette, the neonate received hypotonic fluids for both maintenance and deficit requirements in the face\nof nonosmotic stimuli for ADH secretion during the hospitalization. Based on this patient’s weight loss, the\ndegree of dehydration was about 6%. The neonate received about 820 mL of water with about 40 mmol of\nsodium over 36 hours. As mentioned in the critique, in order for the symptomatic hyponatremia to develop,\nthere needs to be an increase in the amount of sodium-free water (hypotonic parenteral solution) provided, with\na limited ability to excrete excessive free water because of uninhibited release of ADH. In addition, this neonate\nreceived at least 11 mmol/kg of sodium, leading to an enhanced sodium excretion.\nThe combination of lower muscle mass with a larger brain cell volume or total skull volume accounts for an\nincreased risk of increased intracranial pressure and neurological damage in children who develop\nhyponatremia. It has been suggested that the “standard” maintenance calculations in children do not account for\n\nthe effect of nonosmotic stimuli for ADH secretion in the hospitalized child. In general, the stimuli for\nincreased ADH release include neurological conditions, pulmonary conditions, gastroenteritis, chronic lung\ndisease of prematurity, children receiving some forms of chemotherapy, and during the postoperative period. .\nSimilar to this case, when the serum sodium level acutely falls below 125 mEq/L (125 mmol/L), there is an\nincreased risk for neurologic symptoms secondary to brain cell swelling. The symptoms of acute hyponatremia\nare related to cerebral edema, whereas brain adaptation occurs with chronic hyponatremia (Table).\nTable. Signs, Symptoms, and Complications of Hyponatremia.\nSigns and Symptoms Complications\nThrobbing headache Seizures\nNausea, vomiting Coma\nLethargy, malaise Herniation\nRestlessness, disorientation, agitation Death\nMuscle cramps\nDecreased deep tendon reflexes\nHyponatremia in the perioperative period may occur secondary to non-osmotic stimuli for ADH secretion such\nas vomiting, pain, anxiety, medications (narcotics, anesthetic agents), and positive pressure ventilation. The risk\nof hyponatremia is increased with isotonic volume expansion (surgery, etc) because of excretion of a\nhypernatremic urine. This process is sometimes referred to as desalination. Central nervous system symptoms of\nhyponatremia are related to an acute fall of extracellular fluid osmolality, resulting in a water shift into the\nintracellular fluid compartment. The movement of water into cells causes cerebral swelling and possible\nherniation. Nausea, emesis, headache, and weakness are considered “consistent” signs and symptoms of\nhyponatremic-induced encephalopathy.\nAdditional Readings:\nHoorn EJ, Geary D, Robb M, Halperin ML, Bohn D.

However, it is\nunlikely an 18-month-old boy would be able to chronically ingest his grandmother’s loop diuretic and this\nwould not explain his chronic failure to thrive. Thus, a renal salt transporter defect causing chronic\nhypochloremic alkalosis, mimicking chronic administration of a loop diuretic, is the most likely cause of the\nlaboratory and growth findings. Among the potential transport defects, Bartter syndrome caused by a defect in\nthe basolateral chloride channel (CLCNKB) is the most likely etiology.\nBartter and Gitelman syndromes are autosomal recessive disorders that cause hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.\nIn addition, hyperrenemia and hyperaldosteronism are present, and in some forms, especially Gitelman\nsyndrome, hypomagnesemia may also exist. Another distinguishing feature differentiating Bartter from\nGitelman syndrome is the presence of hypercalciuria in Bartter syndrome. There are currently 5 different\nvariants of Bartter syndrome described that are caused by defects in at least 5 different genes (Table).\nBefore the clinical and molecular description of additional variants, classic Bartter syndrome was described to\nresemble a patient on loop diuretics, whereas Gitelman syndrome had features (especially hypomagnesemia)\nthat were similar to patients taking thiazide diuretics. In fact, the SLC12A3 gene that codes for the thiazide-\nsensitive sodium chloride cotransporter is the gene mutated in Gitelman syndrome. About half of the patients\nwith Bartter syndrome also develop hyperuricemia, similar to that seen after administration of loop diuretics.\nIn this patient’s case, the lack of hypomagnesemia makes Gitelman syndrome less likely than Bartter\nSyndrome.\nBartter syndrome and Gitelman syndrome present with a variety of phenotypes and genotypes (Table).\n\nTable.

Biol Cell.\n2012 Apr;104(4):201-12\nThe furosemide-sensitive sodium–potassium-2-chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) reabsorbs sodium, potassium,\nand chloride (proportionally 1 Na -1K -2Cl). The renal outer medullary potassium channel facilitates the\npassage of potassium back into the tubular lumen. Calcium and magnesium are passively reabsorbed by a\nparacellular pathway. This process is driven by the lumen-positive transepithelial potential. The sodium–\npotassium–adenosine triphosphatase (Na-K-ATPase) actively exchanges sodium from the intracellular\n\ncompartment to the basolateral aspect of the tubule for potassium (3 Na for every 2 K exchanged). Chloride\nleaves the intracellular compartment to the basolateral aspect of the cell through chloride channels (CLCNKB\nand CLCNKA). Barttin is an important subunit essential for the normal placement and regulation of CLCNKB\nand CLCNKA. Patients with this mutation may present with sensorineural hearing loss. Defects in any of these\nchloride channel components can lead to metabolic alkalosis or Bartter variant (Table).\nCongenital secretory chloride diarrhea is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the SLC26A3\ngene. Polyhydramnios and premature birth are common. These patients have watery diarrhea with abdominal\ndistention shortly after birth and also develop hyperbilirubinemia and an electrolyte disorder similar to that seen\nin Bartter syndrome; however, stool chloride levels in congenital secretory diarrhea are greater than 90 mEq/L\n(90 mmol/L).

There was a small amount of amniotic fluid on a 19-week ultrasonography, but no amniotic\nfluid could be detected by the time of a repeat ultrasonography performed at 24 weeks of gestation. By that\ntime, the fetal bladder appeared empty and it was very difficult to identify any renal tissue on ultrasonography.\nThe remainder of the fetal screen was normal. The infant was born at 36 weeks gestation, weighing 3.6 kg. At\ndelivery, she appeared vigorous and demonstrated good respiratory effort with normal oxygenation.

    "correct_index": 2,
    "explanation": "C. the percentage of the cardiac output delivered to the kidneys will rise\nThe proportion of cardiac output distributed to the kidneys changes with variation in renal and systemic\nvascular resistance. Neurohumoral and autoregulatory processes work in conjunction to maintain glomerular\nfiltration rate with changing volume status. In the adult at rest, blood flow to the kidneys is 20% to 25% of\ncardiac output, despite the fact that the kidneys only represent about 1% of the body mass, compared to about\n3% in the fetus. Renal blood flow and the proportion of cardiac output delivered to the kidneys also vary\ndepending on development, with significant differences between the fetus, neonate, and mature individual.\nRenal blood flow in the fetus is low, rising shortly after birth. Resistance in the fetal kidney is presumed to be\nhigh. As the fetus develops, renal blood flow increases. Measurements of fetal renal blood flow in human\nfetuses using color-pulsed Doppler measurements demonstrate an increase of nearly 10 times from 20 to 40\nweeks gestation. With regard to the proportion of fetal cardiac output distributed to the kidneys, one must recall\nthe differences between fetal, newborn, and adult circulation. As opposed to postnatal life, where systemic and\npulmonary circulation are in series and stroke volume of left and right ventricle are equal, cardiac output must\nbe defined differently for the fetus. The right ventricle receives about 65% of the venous return and the left\nventricle about 35%. Consequently, the fetal cardiac output is often defined as the total output of both\nventricles: the “combined ventricular output (CVO).” About 45% of the CVO is directed to the placental\ncirculation, with only 8% of CVO entering the pulmonary circulation. Studies in fetal sheep performed by\nRudolph and Heymann in the 1970s showed that distribution of cardiac output to the kidneys was between 1.8%\nand 2.9%. Other studies in the fetal sheep model demonstrate that renal blood flow in the fetus is subject to\nautoregulation. In association with the low renal blood flow fetal glomerular filtration rate is also very low,\nranging from less than 1 mL/min at 20 weeks to 5 mL/min at term.\nRenal blood flow rises after delivery, but it remains well below the levels seen in adults. Systemic vascular\nresistance decreases markedly after birth; drop in renal vascular resistance is proportionally less. This may\ncause a redistribution of blood flow to organs other than the kidney and may contribute to the low neonatal\nrenal blood flow immediately after birth. Renal vascular resistance drops rapidly thereafter and is believed to be\nthe most important factor in postnatal renal hemodynamics, as noted by Gruskin and colleagues. Using a piglet\nmodel, they demonstrated increasing renal blood flow concordant with an 86% decrease in renal vascular\nresistance. Renal blood flow continues to increase after birth in a linear fashion, in parallel with increasing\nsystemic blood pressure and decreasing renal vascular resistance. This leads to increasing glomerular filtration\nrate. The proportion of cardiac output distributed to the kidneys is 4% to 6% in the first 12 hours of life and\nincreases to 8% to 10% in the first week of life, rising to 15% of cardiac output by the end of the neonatal\nperiod.\n\nStudies in animals in the 1970s, using canine and rodent models, demonstrated a more rapid rise in perfusion of\nsuperficial compared to deep nephrons shortly after birth. This was not accompanied by an increase in\nsuperficial glomerular volume, suggesting that changes in hemodynamic resistance were responsible for the\ncentrifugal functional maturation of the nephrons. These observations are also consistent with falling renal\nvascular resistance after birth.\nCardiac output to the kidneys is determined by a variety of other factors that are innate to the cardiovascular\nsystem. First, the volume of circulating blood influences output. Indeed, a higher volume of blood reaching the\nheart will result in a greater force to expel that volume. This mechanism has been shown to be less mature in\nfetal versus adult animals, and is likely due to immaturity of the cardiac muscle. As a result, the fetal heart\ncannot increase output beyond a certain value, while the adult heart can compensate for increased return\nvolume. Heart rate also influences cardiac output. However, while in adults there is a direct relationship\nbetween heart rate and cardiac output, this relationship may not be identical in the fetus. In addition, compared\nto the adult heart, the fetal heart may be more sensitive to afterload changes, resulting in a reduction in stroke\nvolume, and therefore, cardiac output.\nIn the vignette, the newborn has congenital anomaly of the kidney and urinary tract, possibly renal dysplasia.\nAlthough renal function may be poor compared to other neonates with normal kidneys, the expected changes\nwith transition from fetal to postnatal life likely will still occur. Renal blood flow will increase as renal vascular\nresistance declines, leading to a rise in glomerular filtration rate. In turn, the proportion of the cardiac output\ndelivered to the kidneys will increase. While creatinine may rise initially, this does not necessarily imply a\nworsening of glomerular filtration rate; in fact, renal function may improve as the newborn adapts to postnatal\nlife and the renal vascular resistance falls.

      "detrusor activity during the entire filling phase",
      "electromyography activity remaining quiet during detrusor contractions Answer E Bladder function is usually defined by both appropriate storage of urine in the bladder and adequate emptying. The pattern of micturition requires complex interactions between the bladder, urethra, sphincter, and autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) nervous system. Proper bladder function requires 2 main phases: filling (storage) and voiding (micturition, emptying). During the filling phase, adequate bladder storage capacity is accomplished by the presence of properly functioning detrusor muscle, which consists of a meshwork of smooth muscle fibers that function as a single unit, with the ability to elicit nearly maximum active tension over a wide range of length. This allows the bladder to fill with urine from the upper tract at relatively low pressures. During filling, the wall tension increases without a concomitant increase in pressure, permitting continued filling. This compliance (elasticity) is achieved via sophisticated neuromuscular and connective tissue anatomy. While the detrusor permits filling, the bladder sphincter contracts to prevent urine leakage. During the voiding phase, a voluntary relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles initiates a reflexive bladder contraction that consists of funneling of the bladder outlet, relaxation of the sphincter, and the synchronous contraction of the detrusor muscle, all causing voiding to occur. In children, normal bladder function parameters are variable because maturational aspects ensue. Nervous system control of bladder filling is achieved by interaction between sympathetic and parasympathetic output, with input from the somatic reflex. Simply, sympathetic input permits bladder filling (stretching of the detrusor muscles and tightening of the sphincter). Norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter responsible for detrusor relaxation. Parasympathetic input induces bladder voiding (contraction of the detrusor) via the cholinergic pathway, For quantification of normal function, storage and voiding are broken down to measurable characteristics. Bladder storage (filling) phase: 1. Bladder capacity- defined as maximum capacity of bladder to the point of maximal filling, the point of desire to void or overflow leaking. Young infants bladder capacity in mL= 38 + 2.5 x age in months Older children bladder capacity in mL = (Age in years + 2) x 30 (Koff formula) (used generally after 2 years of age) 2. Bladder compliance – defined as the pressure in the bladder as volume in the bladder increases. This is measured as the slope of the filling phase curve. 3. Bladder sensation- measured as 2 parameters – sensation of first fullness and the point of desire to void. 4. Sphincter function- ability of the bladder neck and proximal urethra to remain closed during the filling phase. Voiding Phase (depends on 2 parameters): 1. Ability of the detrusor muscle to contract and generate pressure 2. Ability of sphincters relax in a coordinated manner Urodynamic studies require insertion of a bladder catheter to facilitate filling of the bladder as well as measure pressures, a rectal catheter to monitor abdominal pressure, and electromyography (EMG) attached to the perineum, the latter of which measures activity of the pelvic floor. In addition, studies are often conducted with fluoroscopy to visualize the bladder neck and urethra, as well as assess the efficiency of emptying. The Figure shows a urodynamic study for a 10-year-old girl. Pves is the pressure measured by the bladder catheter, Pabd is the abdoninal pressure measured by rectal manometer, and Pdet is the detrusor pressure that is the difference between Pves and Pabd. Electromyography records the activity of the pelvic floor. V inf is the volume infused. The first vertical line is the first urge and second one is the point of voiding. As can be seen in the Figure, the detrusor pressure has some mild elevation at the time of the first urge and then a significant increase at the time of voiding. The EMG shows some baseline pelvic activity and a quiet phase at the time of voiding. The volume infused would indicate the bladder capacity at both the phase of first urge and final voiding. Normal bladder capacity for a 10-year-old girl would be 330 mL to 360 mL. Usually, the volume at which the first urge occurs would be about 230 mL to 250 mL. In the vignette, it appears that the patient has an overactive bladder, which is generally associated with a small bladder capacity, enhanced detrusor activity early in the filling phase, increase in the bladder pressure, and sensation of bladder fullness even at a low fill volume. In addition, the patient may have voluntary pelvic muscle contraction to counteract the urge incontinence. Of all the choices provided, EMG activity indicating pelvic floor relaxation (quiet phase) is the only one associated with normal bladder function in a 10-year-old girl. The remaining options (low bladder capacity, low bladder pressure, and sensation of bladder fullness at low volume) would be consistent with a voiding disorder PREP Pearls  Adequate storage of urine is accomplished by the presence of detrusor muscle, which consists of a meshwork of smooth muscle fibers that function as a single unit with ability to elicit nearly maximum active tension over a wide range of length allowing the bladder to be filled with urine from the upper tract at relatively low pressures.  During the voiding phase, a voluntary relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles initiates a reflexive bladder contraction that consist of funneling of the bladder outlet, the relaxation of the sphincter, and the synchronous contraction of the detrusor muscle, causing voiding to occur.

      "echocardiography to evaluate for supravalvular aortic stenosis",
      "renal ultrasonography to evaluate for the presence of angiomyolipomas Answer A All hypertensive children should undergo a work-up at initial presentation to evaluate for a secondary cause of hypertension. A work-up is much more likely to reveal a secondary cause in younger children with higher blood pressure readings at presentation. A 6-year-old child with malignant hypertension requiring intensive care unit level care as described in the vignette is therefore extremely likely to have a secondary etiology of hypertension. The common causes of hypertension in children are shown in Table 1 . Table 2 lists several syndromes with hypertension as a known characteristic and the known mechanisms for each. The elevated renin noted in the vignette raises suspicion for renovascular disease. The most common cause of renovascular disease in children is fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). This noninflammatory disorder can cause stenosis in any artery and may show a classic bead on a string appearance or a discrete narrowing on angiography. When occurring in the renal arteries or aorta proximal to the renal arteries, it can cause renovascular hypertension. Other associated findings include arterial stenosis and related ischemia, arterial occlusion, aneurysm, and dissection. Fibromuscular dysplasia may mimic systemic vasculitis as seen with multiple rheumatological diseases. However, children with FMD do not have lab findings consistent with inflammation such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and systemic lupus erythematosus are several examples of vasculitides that can present in childhood and have hypertension as an associated symptom. These disorders can have a wide array of clinical symptoms and can be primary or secondary in origin. Inflammation is a common pathophysiological finding. The size of the involved vessels and the presence or absence of specific antibodies helps classify each subcategory. However, nothing in this child’s examination or laboratory findings is suggestive of a rheumatologic disorder and his age, sex, and race make such a diagnosis unlikely. While the child in the vignette could certainly have renal artery stenosis related to any of these diagnoses, the physical examination shows Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas), which are pathognomonic for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Further, these children often have areas of hyperpigmentation (“café au lait” spots) and freckling in the axillary and inguinal regions as early skin findings prior to the development of peripheral neurofibromas. This neurocutaneous syndrome is associated with hypertension commonly related to renal artery stenosis, which is best diagnosed by renal angiography. Occasionally, children with NF1 have pheochromocytoma as the cause for their hypertension, which is generally associated with symptoms such as intermittent headache, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. Antinuclear antibodies, dsDNA, C3, C4, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are diagnostic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus and are not indicated in this patient because of noncontributory history and physical examination, as well as a normal urinalysis. Children with renal cortical scarring related to a vascular insult or reflux nephropathy may also have renin-mediated hypertension. There may or may not be a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, voiding dysfunction, vesicoureteral reflux, or other congenital anomalies of the kidney and urologic tract, neonatal intensive care unit stay, or umbilical catheter placement. Other possible findings in children with renal cortical scarring include proteinuria and elevated creatinine. However, in view of no history of urinary tract infection and the presence of physical signs suggestive of NF, the possibility of renal scarring causing hypertension is less likely in this patient. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome (formerly Williams syndrome). It is a genetic disorder affecting multiple organ systems, including the cardiovascular system. Half of affected children develop hypertension related to vascular anomalies such as supravalvular aortic stenosis, renal artery stenosis, and mid-aortic stenosis. For this reason, all children with Williams-Beuren syndrome should have routine blood pressure measurements to screen for hypertension and they should undergo an evaluation for renovascular disease if hypertension is diagnosed. Children with Williams-Beuren syndrome have a characteristic appearance: “elfin” facies described as a broad forehead, short, broad- tipped nose, wide mouth, and full lips. Affected children also have short stature, development delay, and cognitive impairment with a charming “cocktail personality.” There are no associated skin findings, but hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria can be found. The lack of these findings on physical examination and work-up make this diagnosis less likely for the child in the vignette. Angiomyolipomas occur in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is another genetic syndrome associated with hypertension. This neurocutaneous disorder caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 gene or the TSC2 gene also involves multiple organ systems. Hypertension in children with TSC has several possible etiologies: coarctation of the aorta, renal artery stenosis, aortic aneurysm, and elevated renin related to renal lesions such as angiomyolipomas. Eye findings in TSC include retinal hamartomas, retinal achromic patches, and eyelid angiofibromas, not Lisch nodules as described in the vignette. Further, characteristic skin findings are hypopigmented lesions (ash leaf spots) and raised, firm yellow, red, or pink nodules with an orange peel-texture (Shagreen patches), not hyperpigmented lesions as described in the vignette.

      "mesangium",
      "subendothelial space",
      "subepithelial space",
      "tubular basement membrane Answer D The patient in the vignette has clinical features consistent with membranous nephropathy (MN). Membranous nephropathy features immune deposits in the subepithelial space only and complement activation, inducing changes and damage to the glomerular filtration barrier. As a result, there has been intense research to identify the causative antigens. Membranous nephropathy can be primary or secondary. Primary MN is rare in childhood, but is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Most MN in childhood is secondary and is caused by systemic lupus erythematosus, infection, drugs, or neoplasia. Membranous nephropathy typically presents with nephrotic syndrome. Often, it is associated with massive proteinuria and patients are at risk of a venous thrombosis. Recently, it has been established that up to 80% of patients with primary (idiopathic) MN exhibit circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4 autoantibodies to phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), while a very small proportion of patients with secondary MN develop PLA2R antibodies. Polymorphisms of PLA2R or human leukocyte antigen may predispose some people to forming PLA2R autoantibodies. T- helper 2 cytokine activation leads to IgG4 synthesis. Antibodies to PLA2R correlate with disease activity and remission, and are therefore a promising biomarker to monitor efficacy for treatment in MN. B cells are a likely source of PLA2R antibodies and may also act as antigen presenting cells. Based on the increased understanding of the pathogenesis of MN, rituximab (antiCD20 B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) is a therapy being tested for treatment of membranous nephropathy. Although the exact role of PLA2R IgG4 is still under investigation, antibodies to PLA2R may not simply be a biomarker but may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Phospholipase A2 receptor is expressed in the podocyte. Experimental models (Heymann nephritis) indicate that the major antigenic target of human idiopathic membranous nephropathy is the podocyte. Thus, antibodies bind the PLA2R on the podocyte, resulting in in situ formation of antibody-antigen complexes. This leads to the classic pathologic finding on electron microscopy of subepithelial deposits. Other, less common antigens than PLA2R have been identified in MN, including neutral endopeptidase (NEP), superoxide dismutase, aldose reductase, α-enolase, and cationic serum albumin. In infants and children drinking cow’s milk, there may be deposition of cationic bovine serum albumin in the lamina rara externa (“planted antigen”). These planted antigens can bind anti-bovine serum albumin antibodies, leading to MN. Infants expressing NEP born to mothers congenitally deficient for NEP may develop MN due to placental transfer of IgG1 antibodies from mother to fetus. Human and experimental models (Heymann nephritis) of MN indicate that podocyte injury from the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes is mediated by complement activation. The final effector of complement activation is a complex of C5b with C6,C7,C8,C9 (known as the membrane attack complex (MAC) (C5b-9). The MAC forms in the plasma membrane, and can lead to disruption of membrane integrity. Formation of MAC leads to direct podocyte injury by several different mechanisms. First, MAC activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including phospholipases (eg, PLC) and protein kinases (PKC). Second, MAC formation leads to increased generation of reactive oxygen species, endoplasmic reticulum stress and upregulation of the ubiquitin proteosome system. Third, MAC activation leads to alterations in the Rho-Rac-Cdc GTPases that regulate the actin cytoskeleton, promoting disassembly of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions. Together, the effect is to induce podocyte dedifferentiation, with loss of podocyte cell structure (foot process effacement), cell-cell interactions (slit diaphragms), and cell-extracellular matrix attachment. In addition to lupus, secondary MN is caused by other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thyroid disease, and Sjögren syndrome. Hepatitis B, HIV, syphilis, and parasitic infections (malaria, schistosomiasis) are infectious causes of secondary MN. Non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents, D-penicillamine, gold salts, and mercury-containing skin creams are medications associated with secondary MN. Finally, secondary MN can occur with malignancies, particularly solid tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. While the clinical presentation may be similar, secondary causes may be evident on histopathology. Secondary MN is suggested by the presence of atypical lesions. While in primary MN, deposits are predominantly subepithelial, in secondary MN, additional deposits may also be identified in subendothelial and mesangial spaces. Endothelial cell tubuloreticular inclusions are suggestive of MN secondary to lupus and HIV. The other deposits described are characteristic of other glomerular diseases than MN. For example, pure mesangial deposits can be identified in lupus, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, and immunoglobulin A and C1q nephropathy. Subendothelial deposits are present in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, lupus, and cryoglobulinemia. Lupus may also lead to both subepithelial and endothelial deposits and tubular basement deposits. PREP Pearls  The majority of primary membranous nephropathy is associated with immunoglobulin G4autoantibodies to phospholipase A2 receptor.  Membranous nephropathy is associated with formation of antibody-antigen complexes that appear as subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy.  In children, primary membranous nephropathy may also be due to deposition of bovine- serum-albumin-anti-bovine-serum albumin antibody complexes.

      "elective unilateral native kidney nephrectomy peritransplant",
      "high dose intravenous immunoglobulin post-transplant followed by plasmapheresis",
      "keeping the patient's intravascular volume low post-transplant Answer B The vignette presents a case of sporadic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with a rapid progression to end stage kidney disease and negative for podocyte slit diaphragm protein mutations. Such patients are at high risk of recurrence of primary disease post-transplant, with an incidence as high as 50%. This recurrence can occur as early as day 1 post-transplant. Recurrent FSGS disease is difficult to treat and generally requires pheresis and medications. Determining whether recurrence has occurred requires frequent monitoring of the urine protein output, assuming that the only urine output in a patient on dialysis will be from the transplant kidney. A sudden onset of nephrotic range proteinuria would indicate recurrent disease, even if the biopsy looks normal initially. However, some children still maintain urine output and nephrotic range proteinuria from native kidney FSGS, even when in end stage kidney disease. In such patients, detection of recurrence or FSGS in the transplant kidney by assessment of urine protein is confounded by the presence of native kidneys and is extremely challenging. Therefore, some centers elect to remove both native kidneys either prior to, or at time of, kidney transplant in a patient at high risk of recurrence. This practice is NOT universal. Some centers choose to wait until after transplant and remove the native kidneys only if recurrent disease becomes a diagnostic consideration. Additional reasons used for justifying bilateral native nephrectomy in sporadic FSGS include the higher risk of renal transplant thrombosis from urinary leak of antithrombin III, or impaired wound healing if the patient is still edematous. Pre- transplant nephrectomy allows for more time than with peritransplant nephrectomy to reverse hypoalbuminemia and edema, but carries a small risk of nicking the peritoneum, which may be of impact especially if the child was on peritoneal dialysis prior to the nephrectomy. A peritransplant nephrectomy prolongs the operative time of the transplant. The general indications for native kidney nephrectomy in children are provided in the Table . Established malignancy, or a high risk of malignancy, is one of the most common reasons for native kidney nephrectomy, as in the series by Fraser et al or by Ghane Sharbaf et al. Very large kidneys that lead to respiratory compromise may necessitate unilateral or bilateral native kidney nephrectomy. In Finnish type congenital nephrotic syndrome, in contrast to FSGS, the very young infants are commonly debilitated from continuing malnutrition or infections secondary to massive proteinuria and edema. The landmark series from Mahan et al showed dramatic success of elective unilateral or bilateral native kidney nephrectomies, followed by elective dialysis and kidney transplant, in improving patient survival in this condition. Large native kidney urine output, as in tubular disorders such as cystinosis, can lead to post-transplant graft hypoperfusion. Other situations where native kidney nephrectomy is considered include a nonfunctioning symptomatic kidney after ureteropelvic junction obstruction, resistant hypertension, or persistent urinary tract infections where the native kidney is thought to be the reservoir of infection. In adults, common indications for native kidney nephrectomy are renal cell carcinoma, secondary malignancy in failed native kidneys, or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, but these indications are relatively rare in children. Among the choices offered, the only appropriate management choice is B, the removal of both kidneys so that native kidney urine protein output is entirely eliminated. Unilateral native kidney nephrectomy, as in response choice C, would not serve this purpose. Calcineurin inhibitors may reduce proteinuria from native kidneys and may help prevent recurrence and therefore should be used post-transplant rather than avoided. Intravascular volume needs to be kept high post-transplant in all cases to provide adequate perfusion to the new kidney. In nephrotic states, maintaining a low intravascular volume state would additionally aggravate the risk of thrombosis that is already high from urinary antithrombin III leak. Both intravenous immune globulin and plasmapheresis are strategies that have been tried in response to established recurrent FSGS and even in preemptive fashion. However, performing plasmapheresis right after administering intravenous immune globulin would remove most of the administered intravenous immune globulin, so the sequence offered in the vignette would not be logical to adopt.

Preparations are underway for a kidney biopsy for suspected\nrapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN).\nOf the following, the one that BEST characterizes the natural history of RPGN in children is",
    "options": [
      "gradual evolution to chronic kidney over several years",
      "gradual spontaneous resolution and improvement of renal function over months to years",
      "prompt spontaneous resolution and improvement of renal function over days to weeks",
      "rapid deterioration of renal function over days to weeks",
      "stabilization of renal function without further deterioration or improvement Answer D Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a clinical syndrome characterized by hematuria, which is commonly gross hematuria, edema, hypertension, and a rapid decline in renal function over a relatively short period of time (days to weeks). It is characterized morphologically by crescent formation on kidney biopsy. The causes of RPGN (Table) include pauci-immune positive glomerulonephritis, immune complex glomerulonephritis, and anti-glomerular basement membrane RPGN. Decreased kidney function is a central feature of RPGN and the urinalysis typically reveals dysmorphic hematuria, red blood cell casts, and a variable degree of proteinuria. The marked reduction in glomerular filtration rate usually limits the rate of protein filtration and edema is usually due to fluid retention rather than decreased oncotic pressure associated with hypoalbuminemia. The natural history of RPGN is rapid deterioration of kidney function and prompt diagnosis of the cause of the RPGN, and initiation of appropriate anti-inflammatory therapy is very important for the initial management of RPGN and for the optimal outcome. An accurate and urgent diagnosis is essential in the patient presenting with clinical findings suggestive of RPGN. Patients should undergo appropriate serologic tests and usually a kidney biopsy. Serologic tests include anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies, complement component assays, antinuclear antibodies, and others as indicated from the clinical history, examination, and biopsy results. Most patients with RPGN need empiric therapy before serologic and biopsy results are available, particularly if either renal biopsy or interpretation of the biopsy will be delayed for any reason. Empiric initial therapy consists of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone at a dose of 500 to 1,000 mg/day for 3 or more days. Therapy can then be tailored once the specific diagnosis is established. Rheumatology consultation may be needed if the cause of the RPGN is a systemic etiology such as systemic lupus erythematosus or ANCA-positive glomerulonephritis with systemic symptoms. The epidemiology of RPGN in children is unknown. In some studies, crescentic glomerulonephritis is observed in about 5% of unselected renal biopsies. Immune complex glomerulonephritis is the most common cause of RPGN in children and the decline of post infectious glomerulonephritis has changed the epidemiology of RPGN to other causes as described. A nationwide survey of 1,772 adult patients with RPGN in the nephrology departments of 351 tertiary hospitals in Japan revealed that the 3 most important causes of RPGN were renal-limited vasculitis (42.1%), microscopic polyangiitis (19.4%), and anti-GBM antibodies (6.1%). Since RPGN is characterized by rapid deterioration of renal function, stabilization of renal function, prompt spontaneous improvement of renal function, gradual spontaneous improvement of renal function, and slow progression to chronic kidney disease are not likely outcomes. PREP Pearls  The cause of RPGN need to be determined quickly usually be kidney biopsy  Appropriate therapyfor RPGN need to be initiated promptly  There are multiple causes of RPGN including immune complex glomerulonephritis, paucity- immune glomerulonephritis and anti-GBM glomerulonephritis.

She has been trying to adhere to a heart -healthy lifestyle and maintain\nher weight as per her PCP's guidance. A recent echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy\n(LVH).

As she remains hypertensive after 6 months of lifestyle\nmodification and has evidence of target organ damage in the form of LVH, you inform her mother that\nyou would like to start her on an antihypertensive medication. Her mother is very concerned about the\nsafety and efficacy of these medications in children.\nTo address these concerns, you tell her that because of regulations such as the Food and Drug\nAssociation Modernization Act",
    "options": [
      "all anti-hypertensive medications have dosing recommendations for children",
      "efficacy of suspension formulations of all commonly used antihypertensive medications have been evaluated",
      "only antihypertensive medications with pediatric indications are prescribed to children",
      "providers only prescribe medications that have been tested for safety and efficacy in children",
      "some medications are metabolized differently in children and, as a result, may require relatively higher doses than in adults Answer E Prior to the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) of 1997, there was little data available regarding the safety and efficacy of antihypertensive medications in children. As a result, providers predominantly prescribed these agents off label, often without published pediatric dosing recommendations. Since the passage of the FDAMA, many commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications now have US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pediatric labelling. In addition, the clinical trials sparked by this Act have provided needed data regarding drug dosing and metabolism. For example, it is now known that younger children may require higher doses of amlodipine than previously thought and once daily dosing provides drug levels that are similar to the twice daily dosing, the latter which was previously a common practice in pediatric patients. It is also now known that, similar to in adults, black children require higher doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor fosinopril to achieve the same level of blood pressure control as white children. However, this is not the case for other agents such as amlodipine and metoprolol. One of the main reasons for the surge in pediatric trials of antihypertensive medications was the promise of 6 additional months of patent exclusivity with trial initiation. It is important to note that this provision is only applicable to medications currently under patent. Those medications that are off- patent are not offered similar incentives. Thus, many older medications have not and will likely not undergo the same scientific scrutiny as newer agents. As a result, many medications continue to lack pediatric dosing recommendations, as well as safety and efficacy data. One area unique to the pediatric population not addressed by the FDAMA is data regarding the safety and efficacy of suspension formulations of commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications. Provisions to address this knowledge gap were not provided in the Act. Fortunately, some pharmaceutical companies have included suspension formulations in their trials, so some data is available, but with limited commercial availability. While the FDAMA has significantly advanced the field of pediatric hypertension by providing needed data on these medications, gaps remain. As such, providers continue to prescribe antihypertensive medications off-label or without dosing recommendations. Pharmacy record data reveals that 7% of the antihypertensive medications prescribed do not have expert panel dosing recommendations or FDA-approved labeling. The need for off-label use is even more striking amongst the youngest patients: 28.6% of antihypertensive prescriptions administered to children younger than 6 years of age do not have FDA-approved indications for use. To address some of the limitations of the FDAMA, there has been other legislation to promote pediatric research. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) of 2002 authorizes the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to identify off-patent medications and biologics that would benefit from pediatric trials. The Institute then provides the FDA a priority list of these agents, which results in formal requests for clinical trials being sent to manufacturers. Participation is voluntary, so manufacturers can decline to conduct any requested pediatric trials. The NICHD would then have the option to sponsor pediatric research for any agents declined for study by the pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) from 2003 is different than the BPCA in that it requires drug companies to study their products in children. Any new drug application submitted to the FDA for a new indication, new dosage form or dosing regimen, or new route of administration (as examples) would then be required to include a pediatric assessment of the same indication stated in the application. However, under PREA, companies can forego studies in pediatrics under special circumstances. In 2012 the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) was passed. This legislation not only permanently reauthorized both BPCA and PREA, but it extended the BPCA to include neonates. These pieces of legislation have provided essential data and knowledge to allow for appropriate pediatric dosing and use of agents previously only tested in adults. Prior to the enactment of BPCA and PREA, off-label use in the pediatric population was over 70%. This off-label use has since dropped to roughly 50%.

      "potassium citrate Answer B The patient in this vignette has bilateral nephrolithiasis, neurogenic bladder, and most likely urinary tract infection, as evidenced by many bacteria and white blood cells in the urine. His urine pH is alkaline, which is suggestive of urine infection caused by a urease-producing organism. As a result, his bilateral renal stones are likely to be struvite stones and, of all the options presented, the best option for management of struvite stones would be antibiotic administration. Struvite stones are otherwise known as triple phosphate stones. The term signifies the presence of 3 anions (ammonium, magnesium, and calcium) and a single cation- phosphate. Such stones are promoted by high urinary pH. Urease-producing bacteria predispose to such stones as urease hydrolyzes urea in the urine to ammonium and bicarbonate ions. This leads to disassociation of phosphate and supersaturation of magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium phosphate apatite, resulting in stone formation. A variety of bacterial species produce urease such as Proteus, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Providencia, and Klebsiella. Recently, Serratia and Ureaplasma have both been associated with struvite stones. Struvite stones can easily mold into the renal calyces, thereby resulting in renal staghorn calculi. In addition to acting as a predisposing factor, bacteria also produce exopolysaccharides, which act as a biofilm and holds together these stones. As a result, these stones are challenging to treat. The treatment principles are appropriate antibiotic therapy, along with the complete removal of calculous material. Antibiotics alone may not be effective, as they do not penetrate the stones to reach the bacteria. However, antibiotics are to be given both before and perioperatively for safe management of struvite stones. In addition, if residual stone fragments remain, a prolonged course of antibiotics may be necessary. Both the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Urological Association recommend either long term or short term antibiotics for all patients with infection stones. However, high level evidence for a specific antibiotic regimen and duration is still lacking. Eradication of struvite stones requires either percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) or extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL). In adults, PCNL is the gold standard approach, as this ensures complete removal of stone material. However, ESWL is not always recommended in adults, as the struvite stones are larger and friable, leading to retained stone fragments. However, Orsola and colleagues achieved a 73% stone-free rate 2 months after treatment when performing ESWL in 14 children with staghorn calculi. As a result, the AUA has recommended ESWL monotherapy to be considered in adults with only small volume (< 2 cm) stones or nondilated collecting systems or pediatric patients. Occasionally, open surgical removal needs to be performed, though such procedures are not common these days, given the availability of advanced endoscopic techniques. A limited benefit has been seen with the use of urease inhibitors. Acetohydroxamic acid has been used in randomized controlled studies in adults to treat residual fragments; results have shown a significant percentage of patients having less stone growth (17% versus 46% in placebo group); however, a large percentage of patients had significant adverse effects (tremulousness and phlebothrombosis). Newer agents such as citrus medica juice, curcumin, and polyphenols all have demonstrated inhibition of struvite stones in vitro. Medical dissolution therapy with renacidin® has been tried, but has been associated with sepsis and death, leading to withdrawal of US Food and Drug Administration approval in 1962. Urinary acidification with agents such as ascorbic acid, ammonium chloride, and L-methionine have been used in the past, but these have only very limited efficacy and some agents have substantial adverse effects. Crystallization inhibitors such as potassium citrate and neutral phosphates have been used to reduce supersaturation of calcium oxalate. Both therapies have no efficacy and may even have harmful consequences when treating struvite stones. D-penicillamine and allopurinol can cause chemical dissolution of cystine and uric acid stones, but have no role in the treatment of struvite stones. Treatment options for struvite stones are presented in the Table.

This leads to disassociation of phosphate and supersaturation of magnesium, ammonium phosphate, and calcium phosphate apatite, resulting in stone formation.  The treatment principles are appropriate antibiotic therapy, along with complete removal of calculous material  Eradication of struvite stones require either percutaneous nephrolithotomy or extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy American Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)  Know the appropriate therapy for struvite stones Suggested Readings  Flannigan R, Choy WH, Chew B, Lange D.

Both findings are indicative of BK virus infection of the kidney. Though the pictures do not show interstitial nephritis, the jump in serum creatinine in the vignette, along with these biopsy pictures, strongly suggests BK virus nephropathy as the pathology. With more potent immunosuppression in recent eras, opportunistic viral infections have emerged as a major complication of renal transplantation in children. In kidney transplantation, the most important opportunistic viral infections are from cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and BK virus. These infections all share some common characteristics: a) subclinical infection during childhood in immunocompetent people b) a long lived latent reservoir c) a high rate of seropositivity in healthy kidney donors d) a low rate of seropositivity in young recipients e)a primary infection that occurs after transplantation due to viral transmission with the allograft at a time of maximal immunosuppression. The accompanying tissue injury after transplantation is believed to permit the transmitted viruses to change from the latent to replicative phase, a process that takes a few weeks to few months. Viral replication may be silent initially before clinical manifestations of disease, which has promoted some centers to employ serial peripheral blood or urine viral polymerase chain reaction monitoring and preemptive strategies. For cytomegalovirus, universal prophylaxis is recommended for situations other than D-/R- serology. The Table depicts some major viral infections after kidney transplant and their acute and long term features. The child in the vignette has evidence of BK nephropathy, as evidenced by intranuclear viral inclusions on kidney biopsy. For BK virus, the main and recommended initial intervention remains a reduction in immunosuppression to allow the host immune system’s BK virus-specific T cells to mount an effective response and attenuate BK virus proliferation. In the vignette, the patient has a tacrolimus level higher than desired at this time post-transplant. Therefore, a reduction in tacrolimus dose would be the most appropriate next step in the management of BK viremia and renal dysfunction. A variety of preventive and therapeutic strategies have been tried to treat BK nephropathy, mostly reported in case series or single center trials. Drugs such as cidofovir and leflunomide are believed to have in vitro activity against BK virus, but rigorous evidence of clinical in vivo efficacy in human BK virus nephropathy is lacking. For example, while one retrospective study suggested that fluoroquinolones might provide prophylaxis against BK virus nephropathy, the same group’s prospective randomized trial disproved this hypothesis. In the vignette, the other incorrect options are all potential strategies for other biopsy diagnoses: methylprednisolone for acute rejection, switch to sirolimus for calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, eculizumab for thrombotic microangiopathy, or no change if the biopsy does not show any pathology. None of these options would be appropriate as an intervention for BK virus nephropathy.

    "explanation": "C. membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis\nThe membranoproliferative pattern of renal injury is characterized by mesangial hypercellularity, endocapillary\nproliferation, and thickening of the peripheral glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The thickening of the\nGBM is caused by mesangial cell interposition with double contours of the GBM. Mesangial expansion with\ncellular proliferation and extension into the peripheral basement membranes causes a clover leaf-like\naccentuation of the glomerular tuft. The membranoproliferative pattern of glomerulonephritis is nonspecific and\noccurs in primary and secondary forms; secondary forms include infectious causes such as hepatitis B and C,\nmalaria, and other parasitic infections, as well as other causes such as cryoglobulinemia and systemic immune\ndiseases.\nTraditionally, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) has been classified on the basis of immune\ndeposits by electron microscopy as types I, II, or III. Type II MPGN was frequently called dense deposit disease\n(DDD). However, the new classification, which is based on immunofluorescence (IF) staining, divides MPGN\ninto complement-mediated MPGN, also called complement component 3 (C3) glomerulopathy, and immune\ncomplex-mediated MPGN. The former is characterized by IF staining for C3 only, and the latter by IF staining\nfor C3 and immunoglobulin G (IgG), as well as other immunoglobulins. Complement-mediated MPGN is a\ndisorder of alternate complement pathway and the immune complex-mediated MPGN is seen with infections\nsuch as hepatitis C, autoimmune disorders such as lupus nephritis, and lymphoproliferative diseases.\nMembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I is the most common form and is characterized by\nsubendothelial and mesangial deposits on electron microscopy. On light microscopy (Figure 1), the\ncharacteristic histologic features of type I MPGN includes thickening of capillary walls, which is usually global\nand diffuse, but is occasionally focal and segmental. There is mesangial hypercellularity due to mesangial\nproliferation, and the capillary wall thickening is caused by mesangial interposition into the subendothelial zone\nof the capillary loops. Figure 1 is the typical histologic findings of MPGN type I on hematoxylin and eosin\nstain.\nFigure 1.

The University of North Carolina at Chapel\nHill. Division of Nephropathology.\nType II MPGN is characterized by intramembranous dense deposits in the GBM and is therefore also called\nDDD. There is hypercellularity and thickening of capillary walls. Sometimes, there are thickened capillary\nwalls with no hypercellularity, in which case membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis may not be an\nappropriate description and DDD is the more appropriate nomenclature. The PAS (Figure 3) demonstrates\nthickening of the basement membrane and capillary wall.\nFigure 3. Demonstrating the typical light micrographic finding of type II\nmembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\nPermission to reprint from Jeannette JC. Type I Membranoproliferative\n(Mesangiocapillary) Glomerulonephritis. The University of North Carolina at Chapel\nHill. Division of Nephropathology.\nMembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type III is characterized by both subepithelial and subendothelial\ndeposits. There are 2 major morphologic variants of type III MPGN, including the variant described by\nBurkholder and another described by Andres and Strife. It continues to be debated if type III MPGN is a variant\nof type I MPGN or is a distinct clinicopathological entity; their separation does not appear to have any clinical\nsignificance.\nIt is difficult to accurately classify the precise subtype of MPGN on light microscopy alone, as the IF and\nelectron micrograph findings are also very important for accurate classification. Immunofluorescent finding in\ntype I MPGN include predominant C3, IgG, immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and C1q\ndeposits, while only linear deposition of C3 is typically seen in type II MPGN. In type III MPGN, there is\ntypically C3 and IgG deposits, and in some cases, IgM, IgA, and C1q deposits.\nPatients with partial lipodystrophy are susceptible to MPGN, mostly type II. It is associated with persistently\nlow C3 with circulating C3 nephritic factor, which indicates alternate complement pathway activation. This\nmakes response choice C the correct answer. The other choices are less likely in a patient with partial\nlipodystrophy. Crescentric glomerulonephritis is not likely as the clinical course does not show rapid\n\ndeterioration of renal function. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis is a possibility but in the setting of partial\nlipodystrophy and the ocular changes of drusen, MPGN would be the most likely. SLE glomerulonephritis\nwould not be likely in a male without systemic symptoms. The clinical presentation with hypertension, high\ngrade hematuria, and renal insufficiency would make minimal change disease quite unlikely.\nPREP Pearls\n There are three major subtypes of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) including type I, type II,\nand type III.\n Light microscopy is helpful in the correct classification of MPGN, but immunofluorescence and electron\nmicroscopic finding are also very important for the correct classification of MPGN.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Identify membranoproliferative lesions Types I, II, III on light microscopy\nSuggested Readings\n Licht C, Mengel M.

    "explanation": "A. antiphospholipid antibody syndrome\nThis patient presents with splenic infarction, pancytopenia, elevated creatinine, urinary findings, and a positive\nantinuclear antibody (ANA). Her activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is elevated. This clinical picture\nfits systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Her confirmatory work-up\nincluded:\n· Immunoglobulin G (IgG) phospholipid (GPL) antibodies, 76 H 0 to 22 GPL\n· Immunoglobulin M (IgM) phospholipid (MPL) antibodies, 21 H 0 to 10 MPL\n· β-2 glycoprotein 1-IgG, 297 H 0 to 20 U/mL\n· β-2 glycoprotein 1-IgA, 50 H 0 to 10 U/mL\n· β-2 glycoprotein 1-IgM, 124 H 0 to 10 U/mL\nA mixing study only partially corrected her aPTT. A renal biopsy showed World Health Organization class IV\nlupus nephritis.\nDiagnosis of APS requires at least 1 clinical criteria consisting of either vascular thrombosis (confirmed arterial,\nvenous, or small vessel) or pregnancy morbidity (loss of normal fetus after 10 weeks or premature birth due to\npreeclampsia, eclampsia, or placental insufficiency) plus laboratory criteria. The laboratory criteria are the\npresence of any of the following at least 12 weeks apart: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody (IgG or\nIgM) greater than 99th percentile, or anti β-2 glycoprotein (IgG or IgM) greater than 99th percentile.\nIn a large pediatric series of 121 patients, half of the patients had primary APS and half had APS associated\nwith autoimmune disease. Of these, 75% were related to SLE. Associated nonthrombotic clinical manifestations\nin children may involve the hematologic system, skin, and neurologic system. These include Evans syndrome\n(12%), thrombocytopenia (8%), leucopenia and lymphopenia (8%), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (7%),\nmigraine (7%), chorea and athetosis, and seizures (3%).\nIn this series of pediatric APS approximately 80% had some form of anticardiolipin antibody, about two-thirds\nhad some form of antibody to β-2 glycoprotein, about 70% had lupus anticoagulant activity, and 60% had\npositive laboratory tests for SLE.\nOf the 121 patients with pediatric APS, 60% of patients had a venous thrombosis event at onset: most\ncommonly lower extremity (40%), followed by cerebral sinus thrombosis (7%). Arterial thrombosis occurred in\nabout one-third of the patients with ischemic stroke afflicting 26% of patients. Many sites of thrombosis\noccurred in 4% or less of patients including renal vein or artery thrombosis, retinal vein or artery thrombosis,\nmesenteric vein or artery thrombosis, and splenic artery thrombosis. Notably, in a pediatric catastrophic APS\n\nregistry with 45 patients, 15% had splenic involvement. Additionally in the kidney, patients may have a\nthrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) on biopsy.\nSplenic infarction may be the result of abdominal disorders such as peritonitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or\npancreatitis, but the imaging and laboratory findings usually implicate these causes easily. Polycythemia vera is\nassociated with thrombosis due to hyperviscosity of the blood. Splenic infarction with splenomegaly may\nrequire splenectomy in that condition. Polycythemia vera is associated with elevated hematocrit (along with\nwhite blood cell count and platelet count in some patients) rather than pancytopenia. Sickle cell trait is\nassociated with splenic infarction at high altitudes, such as mountain climbing or underpressurized airplane\nflights, and may be catastrophic.\nIn a series of adults hospitalized with cytomegalovirus (CMV), about 6% had thrombotic events. Half of these\ncases were in the lower extremities and one-third involved the spleen. Her gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia,\nthrombocytopenia, and positive ANA may be consistent with CMV and she tested negative for CMV.\nPregnancy loss is a common manifestation of APS in women. In pediatric patients, this family history can be\nimportant because there can be inherited component to APS.\nAdditional Readings:\nLim W. Antiphospholipid syndrome.

    "explanation": "B. GFR increases postnatally because of a marked fall in renal vascular resistance along with a redistribution of blood\nflow from juxtamedullary nephrons to superficial cortical nephrons\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases after birth and reaches adult levels by about 2 years of life. This increase in\nGFR is a result of multiple physiological changes, starting in the neonatal period. The key factors are increased cardiac\noutput, decreased renal vascular resistance, increased perfusion of the superficial (cortical) nephrons, and increased\navailable filtration surface area.\nGlomerular ultrafiltration is dependent on renal blood flow (RBF), which itself is dependent on systemic blood pressure\n(BP) and renal vascular resistance (RVR) as described by the formula: RBF = BP/RVR.\nAt birth, RBF and BP are low and RVR is relatively high due to fetal circulation. After birth, RBF increases because of\nincreases in both the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the cardiac output (CO) to kidneys, which reaches 15% to\n18% over the first 6 weeks of life. This increase in RBF can be substantial; to illustrate this point, 35 week-gestation\ninfants have 3.5 times the renal blood flow as 28 week-gestation infants (35 mL/min per m2 versus 10 mL/min per\nm2). This increased RBF translates to increased glomerular capillary pressure, which favors ultrafiltration.\nAs MAP and CO increase, the RVR decreases. Renal vascular resistance is determined by afferent and efferent\narterioles and is regulated by several systems, including the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system (RAAS). During the first week of life, afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance decreases from the\nrelatively high fetal levels. However, RAAS hormones and catecholamines remain elevated in the neonatal period, with\nrenal angiotensin-converting enzyme levels higher in 2-week-old neonates than in adults. Neonates also experience\nincreased sympathetic nervous system activation, which leads to direct constriction of the afferent arteriole\n(increasing RVR and decreasing GFR) and indirect constriction via further release of renin and activation of the RAAS.\nIn addition to being “primed” for vasoconstriction by having an abundance of enzyme and substrate, the neonatal\nkidney has increased expression of angiotensin II, type 1 (AT1) receptors, which further favors vasoconstriction.\nDespite this, RVR decreases after birth. This is because of a redistribution of RBF centrifugally to the more superficial\nnephrons in the renal cortex and counterregulatory actions of prostaglandins, endothelin, and nitric oxide, which\npromote vasodilatation. In addition, in neonates born before 36 weeks of gestation, nephrogenesis continues, and the\nincreased number of functioning nephrons contributes to the decrease in RVR and increase in RBF.\nCompared to older children, the low blood pressure, decreased RBF, and increased RVR that characterizes early\nneonatal life also explains the decreased renal function. As cardiac output to the kidneys increase, MAP increases, RBF\nredistributes to superficial cortex, the area available for glomerular filtration (glomerular size, GBM surface area)\nincreases with maturation, and RVR decreases, improving renal function. This improvement is manifest clinically by\nthe GFR doubling by 2 weeks of life. These maturational changes occur in preterm and full term infants alike, with\nprogression slower in infants born prematurely. A limiting factor for GFR increase in premature infants is the need for\ncontinued nephrogenesis, which is impacted by degree of prematurity, birth weight (with low birth weight and fetal\ngrowth retardation being risk factors for diminished nephron endowment), and medications utilized commonly in the\ncare of premature infants (gentamicin, amino-penicillins, steroids, indomethacin). Serum creatinine level at birth is\nthe same as the maternal creatinine. Normal premature neonates can be expected to have an average serum\ncreatinine of 1.3 mg/dL (115 µmol/L) (range 0.1-1.8 mg/dL) in the first 10 days of life. By the end of the first month\nof life, the serum creatinine should be less than 1 mg/dL (88 µmol/L).\n\nIn the neonate described in the vignette, a serum creatinine of 1 mg/dL (88 µmol/L) at 1 week of life is not\nparticularly concerning for renal failure for the reasons described previously. Angiotensin II, type 2 receptors are\nprominent in fetal life, waning during fetal maturation. The AT1 receptors, on the other hand, are upregulated with\nfetal maturity, reaching levels twice that seen in adults by 2 weeks of life. Plasma oncotic pressure does increase\npostnatally, but the effect of this on GFR is minimized by the simultaneous increase in glomerular capillary pressure,\nleading to an overall increase in ultrafiltration. Renal vascular resistance actually lowers during nephrogenesis, making\nthe preferred response choice B.\nPREP Pearls\n Glomerular ultrafiltration is dependent on renal blood flow (RBF), which itself is dependent on systemic blood\npressure (BP) and renal vascular resistance (RVR) as described by the formula: RBF = BP/RVR.\n The low blood pressure, decreased renal blood flow, and increased RVR that characterizes early neonatal life\nalso explains the decreased renal function of newborns and young infants.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the major causes of decreased renal function in the neonatal period\nSuggested Readings\n Piscione TD, Waters AM.

    "explanation": "C. has a hidden past emotional connection to the child’s mother\nAltruism is defined as “entailing a selfless gift to others without expectation of remuneration.” In transplantation,\naltruism involves the gift of an organ without the expectation of something in return. Items that may qualify as\nsomething in return include any form of monetary compensation, employment, new health insurance, or gifts in kind,\nsuch as immigration benefits or housing. Notably, in the United States, current laws do NOT allow for the\nreimbursement of a donor’s expenses and time off work, despite efforts to incorporate such reimbursement into law\nwithout considering them as remuneration.\nHowever, the altruism does NOT have to be completely nondirected. Altruism that is directed towards a specific\nindividual, based on some emotional connection, is acceptable ethically. This type of directed altruism should be\ndifferentiated from a restrictive directive that violates Federal laws, ie, restricting the donation of a donor organ only\nto recipients of a certain race. Altruistic donors are becoming more common because the organ shortage continues to\nincrease, such that the gap between listed and transplanted patients gets ever larger. While the human leukocyte\nantigen (HLA) mismatch between an altruistic donor and recipient may be higher than with an HLA-well matched\ndeceased donor, this detriment is overcome by the benefits of using a living donor, with reduced cold ischemic injury\nto the organ.\nIn evaluating an altruistic donor, the living donor team must assess, and in some cases, balance, the ethical principles\nof beneficence, nonmaleficence, and autonomy. Beneficence is the assessment of benefit to an individual, ie, the\norgan recipient, and perhaps also to the donor, who may have an increase in self-esteem. Nonmaleficence is the\nassessment of no harm to an individual. Living kidney donation is the one procedure that actually routinely violates\nthe principle of nonmaleficence because a major surgery is performed upon a donor for no physical benefit to that\nindividual. Fortunately, living donor surgery has an extremely low mortality and the donor is evaluated in such detail\nthat they are most likely healthier than the general population and are deemed fit for organ donation.\nAutonomy is the assessment of the individual’s right to make his or her own decisions, in this case, the autonomy of\nthe altruistic donor to take risks. Mental soundness is a key component of autonomy. In some cases, the motivation\nmay relate to some psychopathology, though this is fortunately rare. If there is no emotional connection to the\nrecipient, the motivation behind the altruism should be explored in detail. In particular, a hidden commercial kidney\ntransaction must be investigated for.\nAutonomy may conflict with medical paternalism, ie, the doctor’s assumed prerogative to make the best physical and\nmental well-being choice for the donor and potentially invoke the “do no harm” principle. Medical paternalism may be\ninvoked when a medical condition substantially changes the perceived benefit. Examples of such situations include\nwhen the donor is found to be hepatitis C positive (which could lead to worse recipient outcomes) or has a previously\nundiagnosed kidney condition (bilateral kidney stones, which may adversely affect donor and recipient prognosis).\nCurrent widely accepted ethical principles in transplantation allow for autonomy over nonmaleficence when overall\nbenefits clearly exceed overall risks.\nIn the vignette, response choices A, B, and E all involve some form of monetary or in-kind benefit to the donor, even\nthough reimbursement for donor expenses as a monetary benefit seems unfair to exclude. Response choice D would\ncall into question the soundness of mind of the donor. However, response choice C is considered acceptable ethically,\neven if the motivation is hidden from the recipient.\n\nPREP Pearls\n Altruistic donation is acceptable ethically under certain caveats.\n Any monetary or in-kind donation is not allowed and should be investigated for.\n Donor autonomy and recipient medical gain has to be balanced against medical risk to the donor.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Recognize the ethical dilemmas involved in altruistic kidney donation\nSuggested Readings\n Freeman RB Jr. The limits of altruism selecting living donors.

    "explanation": "D. focal global sclerosis\nOn renal biopsy specimens, a number of pathogenic processes can be described.\nSclerosis is an irreversible process that is characterized by a homogeneous replacement of tissue with collagen IV,\nsimilar to basement membrane. Sclerotic lesions stain positive with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), silver methenamine,\nand trichrome (blue or green). This may be a common feature of chronic diseases of glomeruli, the tubular interstitial\ncompartment, or vascular compartment. It is commonly seen in diabetic nephropathy.\nIn the vignette, there is replacement of glomerular capillary loops by homogeneous material with blue trichrome\nstaining and strong silver methenamine staining. The pattern of total replacement with sclerosis in glomeruli is a\nglobal pattern, as shown in the PAS staining in the Figure Since it is seen in only 1 glomerulus, the biopsy finding is\nfocal global sclerosis, which is not an uncommon renal biopsy finding. In pediatric patients biopsied at the onset of\nnephrotic syndrome, it is associated with a clinical course similar to minimal change disease. Global sclerosis also\noccurs as part of the normal aging process. In people younger than 40 years of age, less than 5% of glomeruli are\nexpected to be sclerosed. This increases up to 30% of the glomeruli by the eighth decade of life. The aging process\nalso involves fibrosis, particularly tubular interstitial fibrosis. These aging processes drive much of the diminished\noutcomes from older kidney donors.\nFibrosis may also occur in a global or segmental fashion in the glomeruli and may coexist with sclerosis. Whereas\nsclerotic lesions show strong silver staining and PAS staining, fibrosis shows weaker staining with PAS and silver. This\nis because of the presence of collagen type I and III, rather than type IV as seen in sclerosis.\nHyalinosis refers to amorphous accumulation of eosinophilic material (PAS positive, silver stain negative). This is\nusually deposited in the walls of blood vessels, but in glomeruli may be seen around areas of collapse or sclerosis.\nThis lesion is thought to be because of the accumulation of blood proteins. It has a fine granular appearance on\nelectron microscopy. Some patients with nephrotic syndrome will display focal and segmental hyalinosis on biopsy\nwith some segments of some glomeruli replaced by a cellular material-staining positive by PAS, but not by silver stain.\nChronic damage in glomerular disease has been assessed by formalized criteria. For Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP)\nand immunoglobulin A nephropathy, these include a semi-quantitative assessment of glomerular sclerosis, the degree\nof tubular loss or interstitial fibrosis, and the evaluation of hyaline arteriolosclerosis. These chronic changes correlate\nwith outcomes, notably for HSP, semi-quantitative assessment of acute changes, and activity (mesangial\nhypercellularity, endocapillary necrosis, cellular crescent, and leukocyte infiltration), correlated with the development\nof hypertension, proteinuria, or impaired renal function.\nPREP Pearls\n Sclerosis is an irreversible process.\n As kidneys age, they scar.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Identify chronic/sclerosing changes on light microscopy",

    "explanation": "B. intravenous urography\nThe patient’s clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features are all suggestive of a developmental renal malformation\nknown as medullary sponge kidney (MSK). This condition, first described in 1939, is characterized by dilatation or\nectasia of precalyceal or prepapillary collecting ducts, sometimes mistaken for cysts. While this condition is currently\nconsidered as sporadic, family members often have a milder form of the same disease and MSK is associated with\nnumerous other renal malformations; therefore, a genetic etiology cannot be ruled out. In fact, PAX2 gene or GDNF-\nRET gene signaling abnormalities have been found in some cases. Medullary sponge kidney may also occur in\nassociation (causal relationship often unproven) with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, pyloric stenosis, Ehlers-Danlos\nsyndrome, and Marfan syndrome.\nClinically, MSK may remain silent for a long time. The typical presentation is in late childhood or young adulthood.\nChildren often have a history of multiple calcium-containing kidney stones and may develop nephrocalcinosis in a\npapillary distribution. Children may also present with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). These conditions are\nbelieved to occur because of urinary stasis in the dilated ducts. Patients may also develop distal renal tubular acidosis.\nCommon urinary abnormalities include high urine pH, hypercalciuria, and hypocitraturia. Renal insufficiency is very\nuncommon. Rarely, MSK may be silent and diagnosed incidentally.\nRadiologically, MSK is one of the few remaining pediatric conditions that are best diagnosed by intravenous urography\n(IVU). Most pediatric centers have moved away from the IVU. Typical pictures reveal radial collections of contrast\nmedium in dilated papillary ducts, giving the appearance of a blush or linear striations in the mildest cases, or of\nbouquets of flowers when cystic dilation of the collecting ducts is seen in full-blown cases (Figure 2, Figure 3).\nFigure 2 KUB image (top) and IVP image (bottom) showing multiple\nfoci of calcification in the renal medulla of both kidneys\n\nReprinted with permission from Adam: Grainger & Allison's\nDiagnostic Radiology, 5th ed.\nFigure 3 Bilateral MSK and left kidney megacalycosis.

A diagnosis of MSK should be suspected if medullary\nhyperechogenicity or multiple hyperechogenic spots in the pyramids are discovered. However, CT scanning may better\ndifferentiate MSK from other renal anomalies such as cystic kidney disease or papillary necrosis. In this regard, CT\nurography or magnetic resonance urography may prove to be better, but this remains uncertain.\nIn the vignette, the constellation of frequent stones and UTIs should make the nephrologist consider anatomic\nabnormalities such as horseshoe kidney or bladder diverticulum, but these would have been seen on CT,\nultrasonography, or voiding cystourethrogram. Therefore, the nephrologist should consider more unusual anatomic\nabnormalities, especially with the medullary distribution of the nephrocalcinosis. Cystinuria and primary hyperoxaluria\nmay also be considerations in children with frequent stones. Cystinuria is diagnosed by elevated urinary cystine levels\n(not present in this vignette) and hyperoxaluria by markedly elevated urinary and plasma oxalate levels. Primary\nhyperoxaluria is associated with mutations in the AGXT gene that codes for the detoxifier enzyme alanine glyoxalate\naminotransferase, detectable in liver biopsy specimens. Blood leucocyte cystine levels are used to diagnose systemic\ncystinosis, a different disease from cystinuria. The defect in cystinosis is in the CTNS gene that codes for cystinosin, a\nlysosomal cystine transporter. Both conditions would also be more likely to have systemic manifestations and chronic\nkidney function impairment. Dent disease might be a consideration in males, but this was not one of the vignette\nchoices. The urinary amino acid profile is not a routinely requested test, and excess amino acid losses in urine are\nseen in proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An isolated proximal RTA would not explain the recurrent stones and\nUTIs.\n\nPREP Pearls\n Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is a rare renal malformation, presumed congenital, likely caused by several\npossible developmental renal gene mutations.\n MSK presents clinically with stones, nephrocalcinosis, urinary tract infections, alkaline urine, and\nhypercalciuria.\n Radiologically, MSK presents as collections of contrast medium in dilated papillary ducts that show blush or\nlinear striations (milder form), or of bouquets of flowers when cystic dilation of the collecting ducts is seen\n(full-blown form).\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the laboratory and uroradiologic evaluation of medullary sponge kidney including prenatal diagnosis\nSuggested Readings\n Fabris A, Anglan F, Lupo A, Gambaro G.

    "explanation": "C.\nCongenital and iatrogenic solitary kidneys generally exhibit supranormal growth, resulting in increased filtration\ncapabilities and increased size, which may permit short term maintenance of renal function, but may also pose\ndeleterious effects on long term function. Patients with solitary kidney should be followed closely with serial\nultrasonography to assess kidney growth and to monitor for signs of cortical abnormality (hyperechoic parenchyma,\ndysplasia, etc) that could signal impending renal failure. In the absence of higher (grade 2) grade hydronephrosis or\nother associated urinary tract anomalies (eg, posterior urethral valves, vesicoureteral reflux), most authors previously\ncited expected compensatory hypertrophy of the functional kidney as at least 2 standard deviations greater than the\nnormal expected mean renal volume or surface area, but this was not supported by data.\nWhile compensatory hypertrophy is expected in solitary kidneys, the definition of appropriate hypertrophy remains\nunclear. The normal renal length in children age 1 to 18 years with 2 kidneys has been defined as 0.28 × age (years)\n+ 6 cm. Solitary kidneys are expected to grow faster and larger and thus require a separate growth curve. The\nequation 0.4 × age (years) + 7 cm can be used to accurately estimate expected renal length in children (age 1 to 18\nyears) with solitary kidneys and can be used as a quick reference to evaluate for renal compensatory hypertrophy.\nSolitary kidneys that fail to reach this benchmark may lead the physician to suspect the presence of functional ectopic\nrenal tissue, associated dysplasia, or may suggest intrinsic medical renal disease and, thus, should be followed more\nclosely.\nCompensatory renal hypertrophy mainly involves the renal cortex. The region that exhibits the greatest growth is the\nproximal tubule. While the mechanisms mediating this phenomenon remain incompletely understood, classic studies\nby Preisig and colleagues highlighted 2 fundamental mechanisms underlying compensatory renal hypertrophy. They\ndescribed modified cell cycles in which increased mitogenicity combined with an anti-proliferative effect results in\nincreased progression of cells into the G phase, but arrest in the S phase of cell growth. The result is larger cells that\n1\ndo not fully develop. They also described an increase in cell protein without concomitant protein degradation, also\nresulting in larger cells. Factors likely contributing to compensatory hypertrophy include the growth factors insulin-like\ngrowth factor-1 (IGF1), transforming growth factor-β, and hepatocyte growth factor.\nFor the child in the vignette, the best option for management of her solitary kidney is to re-evaluate her in 1 year with\na full physical examination, measurement of blood pressure, renal ultrasonography, urinalysis, and measurement of\nrenal function. The length of her solitary kidney is 8.3 cm, which is normal for healthy children at her age with 2\nkidneys (50th percentile as stated), or using the formula previously stated. However, the expected kidney length for a\nsolitary kidney in a child of her age, using the formula, should be 10.2 cm. Despite the lack of echogenicity, the\nsuboptimal compensatory hypertrophy should lead to the suspicion of intrinsic medical renal disease and is an\nindication for close follow-up and repeat ultrasonography in 1 year. Indeed, the presence of trace proteinuria in a\nrelatively dilute urine may be a potential concern and warrants more accurate quantitation of urine protein/creatinine\nratio with a first morning urine. Since her blood pressure is normal, there is currently no need to plan to evaluate\nambulatory blood pressure.\nPREP Pearls\n The compensatory hypertrophy of the functional solitary kidney is at least 2 standard deviations greater than\nthe normal expected mean renal volume or surface area.\n\n Solitary kidneys that fail to reach this benchmark may lead the physician to suspect intrinsic medical renal\ndisease and thus should be followed more closely.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the clinical concept of compensatory renal hypertrophy\nSuggested Readings\n Akhavan A, Brajbord JS, McLeod DJ, Kabarriti AE, Rosenberg HK, Stock JA.

    "explanation": "B. disturbance in the Wnt-β catenin signaling pathway\nFormation of the permanent metanephric kidney in humans begins around the fifth to eighth week of gestation when\nthe ureteric bud (UB), an outgrowth of the Wolffian duct, invades the adjacent metanephric mesenchyme (MM) in the\ncaudal part of the intermediate mesoderm. Following invasion of the MM, the UB branches repeatedly and iteratively\n(around 15 to 20 generations), and new nephron formation ends between the 34th and 36th week of gestation in\nhumans. In other species, such as rodents, nephrogenesis ends during the first week of postnatal life. The reciprocal\ninductive interactions between the 2 adjacent cell lineages, the MM and UB, not only stimulate branching of the UB,\nbut also convert the undifferentiated mesenchyme into nascent epithelium (renal vesicle). The latter undergoes a\nseries of morphogenetic changes, which include elongation, segmentation, and lumen formation, to form the comma-\nand S-shaped bodies. Fusion of the distal end of the S-shaped body with the UB branch connects the epithelial\nnephron with the collecting system. Invasion of the proximal part of the S-shaped body by endothelial and mesangial\ncell progenitors results in formation of capillary loop glomeruli. The cellular origin of glomerular and renovascular\nendothelial cells is debated, but it is likely that they originate from both outside as well as inside the MM field.\nExperimental evidence indicates that defects in nephrogenesis leading to renal hypoplasia can occur by 1 or more of\nthe following mechanisms:\n1) Failure of UB branching morphogenesis following the invasion of the MM due to a genetic or acquired\ndefect in the GDNF-Ret pathway. This may be caused by hypomorphic mutations in the c-Ret tyrosine kinase\nreceptor or one of its downstream signaling components. Ret is expressed in the UB branch tips, which upon\nstimulation by glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), originating from the adjacent MM, signals via multiple\nmitogenic and migratory intracellular pathways, stimulation of branching, and elongation of the UB branches. Thus,\nmutations in GDNF, or more commonly Ret, can present with renal hypoplasia. Ret is also involved in UB outgrowth\nfrom the Wolffian duct, therefore defects in the GDNF-Ret pathway can be associated with renal agenesis due to\nfailure of UB formation and therefore MM induction.\n2) Failure of MM cell survival. The MM is programmed to undergo apoptosis in the absence of survival growth\nfactors derived from the MM and the UB. For example, defects in MM survival genes such as Bcl-2, fibroblast growth\nfactors (FGF), MDM2, and others will result in premature MM cell death.\n3) Failure of MM cell proliferation. Several growth factors released locally by the MM or UB (eg, FGF2, bone\nmorphogenetic protein-7, Wnt9b, FGF20) are required for proliferation of the MM pool. In their absence, the MM pool\nfails to expand, resulting in the formation of fewer nephrons. The MM cell renewal is also controlled by intrinsic\ntranscriptional regulators, such as Sall1, Osr1, Six2, Eya1, and p53.\n4) Failure of conversion of MM into nascent epithelium. Conversion of MM into nascent epithelium is mediated\nby the Wnt-b-catenin signaling pathway. In this pathway, Wnt9b is released from the UB branches and induces the\nadjacent Six2+ MM to differentiate by stabilizing β-catenin, a transcriptional coregulator. The latter translocates to the\nnucleus and, along with other factors, stimulates gene expression of Wnt4. Wnt4 stimulates mesenchyme-to-\nepithelium transition. Mutations in Wnt9b and Wnt4 or one of its downstream genes cause severe renal hypoplasia\ndue to failure of nephron differentiation. Conversely, mutations in Six2, which serves to renew the MM and suppress\ndifferentiation, cause premature differentiation and depletion of the MM pool and renal hypoplasia.\n\nBladder development proceeds from the cloaca, which is located in the caudal region of the fetus. The cloaca has\nectodermal and endodermal components. The endodermal cloaca and Wolffian ducts combine to form the bladder. The\ndorsal cloaca forms the rectum and anal canal, while the ventral part forms the bladder and the urogenital sinus,\nwhich are the precursors to the bladder and urogenital tracts (urethra in males and urethra and lower vagina in\nfemales), respectively.\nIn the case presented, failure of UB and MM interactions would result in a complete lack of nephron induction and\nfurther UB branching, which leads to renal agenesis, not hypoplasia. Nephrogenesis depends on inductive interactions\nbetween the UB and MM lineages, therefore both the UB and MM must be intact for normal renal development.\nDefects in patterning of the intermediate mesoderm would be expected to cause wide ranging defects in early kidney\nand reproductive organ formation, however, the newborn in the vignette has isolated renal maldevelopment. Defects\nin UB outgrowth or insertion into the bladder trigone would be expected to cause vesicoureteral reflux and\nhydronephrosis. Therefore, the most likely mechanism resulting in renal hypoplasia in this newborn is disturbance in\nthe Wnt-β catenin signaling pathway, resulting in inadequate conversion of the metanephric mesenchyme into\nepithelial nephrons.\nPREP Pearls\n Kidney development depends on reciprocal inductive interactions between 2 intermediate mesoderm-derived\ncell lineages, the ureteric bud (UB) and metanephric mesenchyme.\n The glial-derived neurotrophic factor-Ret pathway and its upstream regulators regulate UB-branching\nmorphogenesis.\n The Wnt-β catenin pathway controls mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition to form nascent nephrons.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the embryologic development of the bladder, ureter, glomerulus, tubules, and renal vasculature\nSuggested Readings\n Costantini F, Kopan R.

      "recurrence Answer A This patient has the classic hemolytic uremic syndrome triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. Diarrheal-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome (D+HUS) is most often caused by Shiga-(or verotoxin) producing Escherichia coli (STEC). E coli O157:H7 is the most common STEC serotype identified. Cows are the reservoir for STEC, and STEC is transmitted to humans by exposure to undercooked beef or unpasteurized apple juice, water, or vegetables that have been contaminated by manure. Person-to-person transmission can also occur, especially in outbreaks. Daycares may be a site of person-to-person transmission. Symptoms typically occur 3 to 8 days after exposure. Ten percent to 15% of those exposed will develop D+HUS; most often, D+HUS ensues 7 to 10 days after the symptoms begin. Risk factors for developing D+HUS after exposure to STEC include young or old age, antimotility agents, severe gastroenteritis, and female gender. Antibiotic administration may also increase the risk. Studies are limited, but it is estimated that there is 1 case of HUS per 50,000 patient-years for those younger than 18 years. The majority of D+HUS occurs in between April to September (spring to fall). The majority of cases occur in children younger than 5 years of age, with mean age near 2.4 years in many studies. Diarrhea may be bloody in up to 75% of cases. Nonbloody diarrhea does not preclude a diagnosis of diarrhea-associated HUS. Only 30% will present with fever, so fever does not differentiate between D+HUS and atypical HUS. Fifty percent to 70% may require dialysis and up to 3% to 9% mortality has been reported. The typical course of D+HUS may result in spontaneous resolution or improvement by approximately 11 days. However, long term effects on glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, and proteinuria may be present in up to 25% of patients. Up to 3% may develop chronic kidney disease stage 5. Severity of illness, duration of anuria, and elevation of the white blood cell count (> 20 X 109/liter) are associated with a worse long term prognosis, but cannot distinguish D+HUS from atypical HUS. Approximately 10% of HUS cases are atypical (aHUS). Some nondiarrheal associated (D-) HUS is due to streptococcal pneumonia. Dysregulation of the alternative complement system, due to genetic mutations and/or antibodies to factor H, plays a role in the development of aHUS. It is uncommon for D+HUS to present before the age of 1 year, and aHUS should be suspected in the very young. aHUS can be triggered by viral infections. This may include viral gastroenteritis, making those cases difficult to distinguish from D+HUS, but often aHUS occurs in the absence of diarrhea. They can present at any time of year and there may be a family history of HUS. Affected patients may have a history of a previous episode of HUS. Onset may be more insidious, with a relapsing course and stronger component of hypertension. Atypical HUS has a worse prognosis than D+HUS, with a historical mortality of 25% and rate of progression to stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) of 60%-70%. Up to 10% to 30% of patients with aHUS will have neurologic involvement. Up to 5% of HUS cases may result from infection with streptococcal pneumonia. Streptococcal associated aHUS is more common in children presenting younger than 2 years of age. The likelihood of an etiology of streptococcal infection causing HUS is highest in patients with meningeal infections, liver involvement, and empyemas. Overall, streptococcal HUS may have a worse prognosis than D+HUS. It is associated with a longer course of illness and hospital stay, a higher percentage of patients requiring acute dialysis (up to 80%), and high (40%) mortality in some small studies. In addition, there is a higher risk of progressing to end stage kidney disease than D+HUS. Multiple genetic mutations have been identified in association with aHUS, and they may impact on the epidemiology and prognosis. Up to 60% to 70% of patients with aHUS will have mutations in the following factors: complement factor H (CFH), complement factor I (CFI), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), factor B (CFB), thrombomodulin, or C3. Other patients have antifactor H autoantibodies (CFH- Ab), particularly in association with gene deletions of complement factor H related proteins CFHR1, CFHR3, and CFHR4. Patients with CFH-Ab are more likely to present between 5 to 12 years of age. Many patients with CFH-Ab will respond to plasma exchange, but there is a high relapse rate of 27% to 58%. CFH-Ab are associated increased risk of hypertension, 20% to 30% risk of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) and a 10% risk of mortality. Of the genetic mutations, patients with CFH mutations have the worst prognosis. Historically, 60% of patients with CFH mutations progressed rapidly to ESKD despite treatment with plasma exchange. Both CFH-Ab and CFH mutations are also associated with an increased risk of extrarenal cardiac and vascular complications, including cardiac insufficiency, myocarditis, and gangrene. Recently, early onset aHUS (age < 2 years old) has been associated with mutations in a new gene called diacylglycerol kinase-ε (DGKε) (present in between 5% to 23% of early-onset aHUS patients, depending on the cohort study), which is not a complement regulatory factor and may affect the coagulation cascade. The advent of complement directed therapy, eculizumab, has markedly improved the prognosis aHUS, particularly in patients with mutations in the complement regulatory system. Up to 95% of patients with aHUS respond to eculizumab. However, timing (induction vs. maintenance) and length of treatment with eculizumab, as well as its role in management of CFH-Ab and DGKε associated aHUSm are under active study. PREP Pearls • Diarrheal-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome (D+HUS) is associated with exposure to Shiga-(or verotoxin) producing Escherichia coli, often during spring through the fall, most often in patients younger than 5 years of age. • Most D+HUS resolves spontaneously, but there is 3% to 7% mortality, 50% to 70% of patients require dialysis and up to 25% may have long term consequences, including decreased glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, and proteinuria. • Atypical HUS most often occurs without diarrhea and can present at any time during the year. It often has an insidious and relapsing presentation and has a worse prognosis, with mortality up to 25% and end stage kidney disease up to 70% to 80% if untreated.

      "last fill volume Answer: C Defining adequacy of dialysis in children has historically been difficult because of a limited number of patients to systematically study, as well as the need for different criteria than adult studies. Adult dialysis studies have historically used mortality and cardiovascular morbidity outcomes as comparative criteria for adequacy standards, which are thankfully less common (mortality) or less severe (morbidity) in the pediatric dialysis population. However, in the absence of applicable measures for adequacy in the pediatric age group, many guidelines have applied adult standards for solute clearance to this population. The current National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) recommendations for adequate solute clearance in peritoneal dialysis (PD), which is applied to children as well, is a minimum weekly Kt/V urea greater than 1.8 for the sum of dialysate and urine. Previous iterations of these guidelines had recommended minimum clearances of creatinine along with Kt/V urea, however, the clearance of creatinine is much better maintained by the kidneys than by peritoneal dialysis. It became difficult to determine if the benefit of improved creatinine clearance was from improved dialytic clearance or simply from the preservation of residual renal function, as the benefit was not necessarily seen in anuric patients. Therefore, it is recommended to take steps to best preserve residual renal function (avoid nephrotoxic drugs, treat urinary tract infections, use of diuretics, etc) whenever possible, however, solute clearance goals in dialysis have shifted away from creatinine as a surrogate marker. Kt/V urea may be calculated by measuring the concentration of urea (mg/dL) in the dialysate, urine, and blood (blood urea nitrogen), while also measuring the daily volumes of dialysate and urine and applying to the following formula: This product is then divided by the volume of distribution (Vd) of urea in the body or total body water, also measured in liters (L), which may be estimated by the use of nomograms or listed equations for body surface area (BSA). In an anuric patient, this equation may be simplified to: Daily Kt/V urea = [urea]dialysate/[urea]blood x Volume dialysate (L)/ Vd (L) Weekly Kt/V urea = ([urea]dialysate/[urea]blood x Volume dialysate/ Vd) x7 It is recommended that a weekly Kt/V urea be routinely checked in stable patients at least every 6 months, but more frequently if there are any concerns about the patient’s clinical condition, such as decreased urine output or uremic symptoms. Pitfalls to achieving an optimal Kt/V urea include inappropriate fill volumes (decreasing the total volume of dialysate), fluid overload (increasing Vd), and inappropriate dwell times (not optimizing the [urea]dialysate/[urea]blood). The recommended fill volumes for pediatric patients, like in adults, are based on body surface area (BSA). In children 2 years of age and older, the recommended exchange fill volume is 1,000 to 1,200 mL/m2, like in adults. For infants, the recommended fill volume is only 600 to 800 mL/m2, as the peritoneal membrane surface area is much greater per unit of weight in infants than in adults. Using weight-based estimates of fill volumes, such as 40 mL/kg, will often result in underprescribing of dialysate and less than optimal solute clearance, like in the given example. Exchange volumes in excess of these recommendations (> 1,400 mL/m2) may result in elevated intraperitoneal pressure and adverse effects on the exit site, gastric motility, patient comfort, and ultrafiltration capacity. Similarly, many patients, especially infants who are prone to hernias and feeding issues, may not tolerate volume increases even into the recommended range, but still achieve adequate small solute clearance. In most patients that are not high transporters, increasing the exchange fill volume is the most effective way to improve solute clearance. The last fill in continuous cycling PD (CCPD) can also provide additional clearance. Since this exchange is over a prolonged period, in addition to the fact that it is only 1 exchange, changes to the last fill volume are not as effective in clearing small solutes as changes to regular exchange fill volumes. However, it may improve middle molecule clearance more readily, as nocturnal intermittent PD without a last fill has decreased middle molecule clearance compared to CCPD. The addition of a midday exchange during the prolonged daytime dwell can increase the daily Kt/V urea, as it provides more dialysate volume and greater urea removal. Knowledge of the transport characteristics of the peritoneal membrane can help in individualized prescribing of dwell times for patients. This may be done with a peritoneal equilibration test (PET). The PET is a 4-hour test that measures the patient’s [urea]dialysate/[urea]blood (as well as creatinine and glucose), and categorizes the rapidity of transport across the peritoneal membrane against measured standards (Figure). In patients with high or high average transport characteristics (solid black shading and top gray area with vertical lines at top of curve Figure), the [urea]dialysate/[urea]plasma has its highest slope in the first hour with a less gradual increase in the ratio with each subsequent hour. Therefore, these patients equilibrate urea more quickly and gain less hourly clearance of urea with longer dwell times beyond 60 to 90 min. They may experience improved small solute clearance with shorter dwell times, but this would entail a greater number of exchanges in the same time period. High transporters may also have difficulty achieving adequate fluid removal, as glucose transport is also rapid and the osmotic gradient between the patient’s serum and dialysate can decrease quickly. Patients with low or low-average transport exhibit slower solute clearance, including glucose transport, and would therefore benefit from longer dwell times and are better candidates for continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) in which manual exchanges are performed during the day and a prolonged exchange, or last fill, dwells through the night. As the PET provides very useful information, it is recommended to be performed 4 to 8 weeks after the initiation of PD, once full fill volumes have been achieved. Performing a PET earlier than 4 weeks may yield higher transport results than if checked weeks later. Additionally, a PET should be repeated after episodes of peritonitis or if there is clinical suspicion of a change in transport characteristics, such as uremic symptoms or fluid overload, as the peritoneum’s transport characteristics may alter over time. There are other tests of peritoneal membrane function that can be performed in patients on CAPD, such as the peritoneal function test and peritoneal dialysis capacity test. These tests can also provide information about protein and nutritional status, in addition to fluid and solute transport characteristics. Although Kt/V urea provides a measure for adequacy, there are other manifestations of inadequate dialysis that should be evaluated regularly and adjusted for in the PD prescription. This includes volume overload (uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, excessive weight gain), electrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia), overt uremia (neurologic changes, poor daily functioning), and clinical or biochemical malnutrition (weight loss, hypoalbuminemia). Additionally, quality of life factors for the patient and the family should also be considered in evaluating the adequacy of treatment. The potential impact of a PD prescription change, like longer time spent on CCPD or conversion to CAPD, on school and extracurricular attendance and performance should also be taken into account. For the patient in the vignette with a suboptimal Kt/V of 1.6, the most efficient maneuver to enhance adequacy would be to increase the fill volume. Based on her BSA, there is certainly room to increase the fill volume. Increasing the dialysate osmolality, most commonly achieved by increasing the dialysate dextrose concentration, may enhance ultrafiltration but will have a minimal impact on Kt/V via solvent drag. This patient is a high (rapid) transporter, and therefore increasing the dwell time will be counterproductive for enhanced solute clearance. Increasing the last fill volume may slightly improve Kt/V, but not as robustly as increasing the fill volume. PREP Pearls • In general, clearance of small solutes, like urea, may be best increased by increasing the fill volume per exchange into the recommended range as tolerated. This range is 600 to 800 mL/m2 for infants and children younger than 2 years of age and 1,000 to 1,200 mL/m2 for children older than 2 years of age. • Determination of the peritoneal membrane’s transport characteristics can assist in estimating appropriate dwell times for the individual patient. This will aid in writing the peritoneal dialysis (PD) prescription for both solute clearance as well as for fluid removal. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) is a commonly used measure, especially for continuous cycling PD, while the peritoneal function test and the peritoneal dialysis capacity test may be used for continuous ambulatory PD. • Kt/V urea is one measure (of solute clearance) to determine if the prescribed dialysis is adequate for an individual patient. However, fluid status, electrolyte balance, overall nutrition, and quality of life should also be evaluated.

      "Figure E Answer: C The child in the vignette has a history that is suggestive of possible BK nephropathy. BK nephropathy often presents with varying degrees of renal dysfunction in renal transplant patients. There is often a notable absence of proteinuria, hematuria and constitutional symptoms, and diagnosis typically requires a renal biopsy. The renal manifestations of viral infections depend on the immune status of the host, and differ in native versus transplant kidneys. In native kidneys, glomerular disease is the most common viral induced renal manifestation. HIV and hepatitis B and C are the most common viruses to induce glomerular disease. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) most often appears pathologically as collapsing focal glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). It has recently become clear that host factors affect risk of HIVAN, and the presence of 2 ApoL1 risk alleles (present in up to 12% of African-Americans) are strongly associated with development of HIVAN. Hepatitis B is associated with development of membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. Hepatitis C is associated with most often with development of MPGN and mixed cryoglobulinemia, and much more rarely immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, FSGS, postinfectious GN, immunotactoid glomerulopathy, or fibrillary GN. Hepatitis B and C MPGN likely results from deposition of antigen- antibody complexes. Hepatitis B and C infection-induced MPGN usually presents with nephrotic proteinuria and hematuria, with low serum complement component 3. It is associated with diffuse endocapillary hypercellularity, lobular appearance of glomerular tuft, and a double contour of the basement membrane on light microscopy. Cryoglobulinemia is associated with periodic acid-Schiff positive microthrombi. In immunosuppressed hosts (eg, with HIV infection or after solid organ or bone marrow transplantation), other viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and polyoma viruses (including BK) may have renal manifestations. In addition, many of these can also affect renal transplants. A double-stranded DNA virus, CMV can cause life-threatening opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed hosts. It can also rarely cause hemorrhagic cystitis. Infection with CMV is associated with renal transplant allograft dysfunction, thrombotic microangiopathy, transplant glomerulopathy, and glomerulonephritis. Cytomegalovirus viral intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions can be identified in tubular, endothelial, and rarely glomerular cells. Parvovirus B19 is a single stranded DNA virus that often causes asymptomatic infections in children (> 50% of people are infected by adulthood). It can cause a red cell aplasia. While it is associated with renal manifestations, it may not be causal in the process. It has been associated with acute postinfectious GN and nephrotic syndrome in native kidneys, and with graft rejection, FSGS, and thrombotic microangiopathy in renal transplants. Adenovirus is a nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA virus. Infections are common in children, often manifesting as respiratory or gastrointestinal illnesses. Adenovirus can cause life-threatening infections and hemorrhagic cystitis in immunocompromised hosts. A rare but severe renal manifestation of adenovirus is acute necrotizing tubulointerstitial nephritis. On renal biopsy, this will appear as tubulointerstitial mononuclear infiltrates, smudge cell formations (nuclear enlargement with intranuclear inclusions and cell degeneration), and often severe necrotizing tubular necrosis. Epstein-Barr virus is a double-stranded DNA virus that is most often associated with development of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease in the setting of renal transplantation. The polyoma viruses include BK virus, JC virus, and Simian Virus 40, which are nonenveloped, icosahedral encapsulated DNA viruses. BK virus is usually acquired in childhood (80% positive by adulthood). After the primary infection, a latent infection with BK remains in renal proximal tubular cells and the uroepithelium. Hemorrhagic cystitis is common in immunosuppressed hosts. BK nephropathy is most often a postrenal transplant complication, and has been reported more rarely in other causes of immunosuppression. BK nephropathy can present with acute tubular necrosis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. Cytopathic changes can be identified in the renal tubular epithelial cells, with enlarged nuclei with gelatinous basophilic viral inclusions. Intranuclear viral particles (45–55 nm in diameter) can be identified on electron microscopy (EM). Electron microscopy in BK nephropathy shows the viral genetic material (nucleocapsid) which can be icosahedral (20 sided polyhedron) or helical. The nucleocapsid can be naked or enveloped in a protective lipoprotein coat. The size, shape, and presence or absence of a coat can, in some cases, help identify the family or type of viral inclusion on EM. In general, however, once viral inclusions are identified on light microscopy or EM, virus-specific immunohistochemical assays or in situ hybridization are typically necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The Table summarizes some characteristic findings of common viral inclusions. Response choice C depicts a typical electron microscopy image of characteristic BK viral intranuclear viral particles of about 30 nm to 40 nm in diameter. For comparison, Figure 6 and Figure 7 shows adenoviral inclusions of varying densities in the nuclei of tubular epithelial cells from a patient with necrotizing adenovirus interstitial nephritis. Response choice A depicts subendothelial deposits and is typical of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (type 1 MPGN). Response choice B demonstrates endocapillary proliferation with electron-dense deposits in mesangial spaces (star) that can be seen with endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis. Response choice D represents tubuloreticular inclusions in glomerular endothelial cells (arrow). The images shown in B and D are those obtained from a patient with HIV-induced glomerulonephritis. Response choice E represents subepithelial deposits often seen in membranous nephropathy, which can occur secondary to viral infections. Patients with either MPGN or proliferative GN would be likely to present with significant proteinuria and hematuria, while patients with membranous nephropathy would be likely to present with nephrotic syndrome and thus A, B, D, and E would be unlikely findings in a renal transplant patient without proteinuria, hematuria, or abnormal glomeruli on light microscopy. PREP Pearls • Viral infections most often manifest as glomerular disease in native kidneys. • Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and BK virus can cause renal transplant graft dysfunction. CMV is associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions, while BK can be identified as intranuclear viral inclusions on electron microscopy. • BK nephropathy in transplant patients often presents with isolated renal dysfunction and a bland urinary sediment.

He was treated on a chemotherapy protocol without major\nnephrotoxins (no ifosfamide or cisplatin) and was a slow responder. His creatinine levels throughout\ntreatment ranged between 0.6 to 0.8 mg/dL (53-71 µmol/L). He was evaluated for escalation of\ntherapy, but was found to have a technetium-99m-diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA)\nrenogram glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 64 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and a 24-hour creatinine\nclearance of 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (urine creatinine 7 mg/kg per day); as a result, further\nchemotherapy was held and you are consulted.

      "arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging for renal blood flow measurement",
      "Tc99m-MAG3 (Mercaptoacetyltriglycine) clearance measurement",
      "measurement of -trace protein for GFR estimation",
      "measurement of 24-hour creatinine clearance with cimetidine blockade of tubular secretion",
      "serum cystatin C measurement for eGFR estimation Answer E The oncologic management of this patient is partially dictated by his renal function. Based on the common height- and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equations (K*Height/Creatinine), he would have an eGFR between 86-115 mL/min per 1.73 m2 based on his height of 168 cm, creatinine range 0.6 to 0.8 mg/dL, and using a K of 0.413. Quick verification of this estimate may be obtained using cystatin C. In this case, a cystatin C level of 0.68 mg/dL would predict an estimated eGFR greater than 100 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Cystatin C is a 13 kDa protein that is freely filtered and whose production is less influenced by body habitus than serum creatinine. There is more than one assay available to measure cystatin C and tables or formulas should be used specifically for the assay. Cystatin C may be depressed in hypothyroid states and elevated in hyperthyroid states, inflammation, and in some reports, in patients on high dose steroids. In addition, validation for cystatin C is established for patients with chronic kidney disease. The cystatin values would thus be inconsistent with the 24-hour creatinine clearance, which showed 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2. In assessing 24-hour collections for clearance, by definition, the serum creatinine must be at steady state and the creatinine production will equal urinary excretion. In a well developed male teenager, the expected production and excretion rates would be 15 to 20 mg/kg per day. Thus, the 24-hour collection with 7 mg/kg per day reflects an incomplete collection or a collection with serum creatinine that was not at steady state (as may be seen in acute kidney injury). Cimetidine blocks the tubular secretion of creatinine and has been proposed to improve the accuracy of 24-hour creatinine clearance measurements of GFR in those with progressed chronic kidney disease, but would not add much in this case. In an effort to identify other endogenous substances that are freely filtered and whose levels may reflect kidney function, β-trace protein has been investigated in children. β-trace protein is a 23 to 29 kDa, 169 amino acid enzyme that is distributed in plasma with a concentration independent of age, but does have some sex related concentration differences. Recently developed age-specific formulas for β-trace protein show that eGFR may perform similar to those using height and creatinine, but the assay is not widely available and further verification is needed at this time. There are a number of freely filtered markers that can be infused and their disappearance from plasma and excretion into urine to determine GFR. Clearance may be calculated by the rate of disappearance of the marker in the blood or the clearance of the marker in the urine. Although mostly used in research settings, some centers perform measurements for clinical care, mostly in adults. Inulin was the original gold standard, but is more difficult to use and is expensive. Current methods use iothalamate, iohexol, 51-Cr-EDTA, and DTPA. A recent meta-analysis of these methods compared to inulin clearance is shown in the Table. Tc99m-MAG3 (Mercaptoacetyltriglycine) is cleared predominantly (95%) by the renal tubules and Tc99m-MAG3 scans are only useful for assessing differential function and urine flow. In an effort to simplify the GFR measurements, renal scintigraphy examining the biodistribution of a glomerular signal (technetium-99m DTPA) compared to an area of background during the first few initial minutes after injection has been used. There are multiple models to calculate GFR that rely on meticulous injection, collection, and interpretation of signals. There are variables (depth of kidneys, appropriate area of background, appropriate region of interest [ie, outline of kidneys], and speed of injection) that affect the results. The cause of the low estimate of DTPA GFR in this patient is not clear, but injection through a high dead space port with a small access needle may have interfered with the bolus injection of tracer and calculation of GFR. Newer methods for renal function assessment include magnetic resonance imaging and renal blood flow measurement using arterial spin labeling. In this technique, the water just below the slice of interest is non-invasively magnetically labeled by a radiofrequency inversion pulse and images are acquired of the labeled slice. After washout, this slice is reimaged. The difference between control and labeled conditions is proportional to blood flow in the slice. The renal plasma flow (RPF) is estimated from the renal blood flow (by using the hematocrit). This allows determination of filtration fraction using the ratio of GFR and RPF and differential RPF (right versus left). This technique still requires another method to measure GFR and is investigational.

The abnormalities in calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, phosphatonin, and parathyroid hormone metabolism that define CKD-mineral bone disorders (MBD) are interrelated with complex pathophysiological pathways. To best understand the etiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD, it helps to understand calcium and phosphorus metabolism in a normal host. Normal calcium and phosphorus homeostasis is regulated by the parathyroid hormone (PTH), active vitamin D, and phosphatonins, with the most studied phosphatonin being fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). These hormones work together to ensure that the concentration of calcium in the plasma is sufficient to perform its many functions and that the total body stores of both calcium and phosphorus are adequate to mineralize the bone and buffer the blood when needed. This ability of bone to buffer the blood is essential to the minute-to-minute regulation of plasma calcium. The substantial storage of calcium in bone allows for plasma calcium to be very tightly regulated, varying little despite changes in dietary intake and output. As a general guide, the primary function of PTH is to control the plasma concentration of calcium, while vitamin D maintains whole body calcium stores and FGF23 maintains normal serum phosphate concentration. There are several stimuli to PTH secretion: hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and low levels of activated vitamin D (1, 25-OH vitamin D). Of these, hypocalcemia is the greatest driver of PTH secretion, as it increases the extracellular fluid concentration of calcium. Parathyroid hormone acts on the bones, intestines, and kidneys to increase plasma calcium levels. Its action on bone leads to a rapid release of labile calcium into the extracellular fluid, along with a more slow release of calcium via bone remodeling that occurs with osteoclast-induced bone resorption and osteoblast formation. Bone remodeling does not normally lead to a net increase or decrease in calcium, as it is primarily meant to maintain bone integrity, but in pathologic states such as when PTH hormone remains elevated, remodeling can lead to fibrosis, bone loss and decreased mineralization. In the kidney, PTH leads to synthesis of activated vitamin D (calcitriol). Calcitriol functions to increase resorption of dietary calcium from the small intestine: actively in the duodenum and passively in the jejunum. Parathyroid hormone also increases plasma calcium levels via its actions on the kidney, directly by increasing renal calcium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and indirectly by increasing urinary phosphorus excretion in the proximal tubule (with less serum phosphorus available to bind calcium, plasma calcium levels are increased further). Overall, each of these actions of PTH leads to the restoration of plasma calcium to stable levels. Vitamin D is considered inactive until it is hydroxylated at the 25th position in the liver and at the first position by the kidney. This fully hydroxylated form (1, 25-OH vitamin D) is biologically active and is generally referred to as calcitriol. The 1α hydroxylation that occurs in the renal proximal tubule cells is stimulated by PTH and is inhibited by FGF23. Once activated, the main action of calcitriol is to increase calcium, and to a lesser extent, phosphorus absorption from the small intestine. Calcitriol also increases renal tubular reabsorption of both calcium and phosphorus, and facilitates normal bone turnover. Fibroblast growth factor 23 is synthesized by osteocytes and osteoblasts in bone. Its secretion is stimulated by hyperphosphatemia, PTH, and calcitriol. By binding to its receptor and coreceptor klotho in the distal convoluted tubule, FGF23 leads to decreased proximal tubule reabsorption of phosphate and decreased production of calcitriol. The FGF23 also suppresses the secretion of PTH. It therefore serves as a check-and-balance in the hormone axis to prevent too much calcium and phosphorus uptake. Serum phosphorus is mainly regulated via the kidney. Like calcium, phosphate is absorbed throughout the small intestine. It is abundant in many foods, particularly protein-rich foods, and the total amount absorbed directly changes with the amount ingested. Blood levels are kept constant via increased renal excretion in the proximal tubule. The sodium-phosphate symporters in the proximal tubule are a tubular maximum-limited system. In normal situations, the amount of filtered phosphorus is slightly greater than this tubular maximum, leading to phosphorus excretion in the urine with usual phosphorus intake. Increased dietary intake leads to an increase in the filtered phosphorus load. This exceeds the resorptive capacity further, with the end result an increase in urinary phosphorus excretion. This action is enhanced by both PTH and FGF23; both hormones are increased in response to hyperphosphatemia and both work to inhibit the Na-phosphorous symporter, further impairing phosphorus reabsorption, leading to increased phosphaturia and lower serum phosphate levels. The hormones described work in concert with each other to maintain calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. As such, they also serve as regulators of each other, forming negative feedback loops to keep each substance at the levels required to maintain balance. Figure 1 summarizes these main pathways and feedback loops. In CKD, there is decreased filtration, which results in an increase in plasma phosphate. This hyperphosphatemia acts as a starting point to many of the derangements noted in CKD, namely secondary hyperparathyroidism, vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, renal osteodystrophy, and growth delay. As previously stated, hyperphosphatemia causes hypocalcemia by complexing with calcium in the blood (lowering plasma calcium levels) and by inhibiting calcitriol synthesis (and therefore decreasing calcium absorption from the gut). Calcitriol production is further reduced by FGF23, the latter which is produced in greater quantities in response to hyperphosphatemia. These sequelae (diminished calcitriol, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia) increase PTH production, which attempts to increase plasma calcium concentration by increasing calcium release from bone. However, over time, with persistent hyperparathyroid hormone secretion (made possible due to the lack of normal feedback inhibition by calcitriol and lack of normalization of calcium and phosphorus levels) results in renal osteodystrophy, potentially contributing to impaired growth and erythropoietin-resistant anemia. Further exacerbating these derangements in CKD is the decrease in vitamin D receptors, calcium-sensing receptors, FGF23 receptors, and klotho coreceptors in the parathyroid gland. With decreased density and presence of these receptors, inhibition, as is normally seen with negative feedback loops, is further compromised. Figure 2 summarizes the abnormalities seen in CKD. In the vignette, we are presented with a child with stage 3 CKD who has evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism: elevated PTH and hyperphosphatemia. While addressing the elevated PTH, one goal is to avoid raising the serum calcium level further. This limits the therapeutic options, as many medications can increase serum calcium. Elevating plasma calcium further needs to be avoided to prevent extrarenal calcification, which can be substantial and lead to morbidity when coincident with elevated plasma phosphate. The first course of action in the care of this child should be to lower his serum phosphorus. This is done via dietary restriction and phosphorus binding. He is already on a dietary phosphorus restriction, and reducing it to such a low level as described in choice A is not appropriate for 2 reasons. First, his current dietary phosphorous restriction is significantly lower than the reference daily intake for his age and further restriction is unlikely to be adhered to, particularly as many child-friendly foods are high in phosphorus content. Therefore, the best management of his hyperphosphatemia is to initiate calcium carbonate therapy with meals, which will not result in an elevation of serum calcium as a minor amount of the calcium is absorbed when taken with food. Lowering the serum phosphorus can cause PTH to decrease and calcitriol to increase, returning many of these levels to normal. Normalizing 25-OH vitamin D is an important component of therapy, but his 25-OH vitamin D level of 29 ng/mL is almost “replete,” making such an increase to his 25-OH vitamin D dose unlikely to have much impact. Starting calcitriol is inappropriate at this time because of its calcium-raising properties. While it would certainly act to inhibit PTH secretion, it would also increase both calcium and phosphorus levels, raising further concern for extrarenal calcifications. Finally, cinacalcet is a calcimimetic more often used with more resistant or tertiary forms of hyperparathyroidism. It is also not extensively used or studied in children, and therefore its use should only be considered once other options have been attempted and proven to be unsuccessful. PREP Pearls • As a general guide, the overall main function of parathyroid hormone is to control the plasma concentration of calcium; main function of vitamin D is to maintain whole body calcium stores; and main function of fibroblast growth factor 23 is to maintain normal serum phosphate concentration. • There are several stimuli to parathyroid hormone secretion: hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and low levels of activated vitamin D (1α, 25 hydroxylase vitamin D). Of these, hypocalcemia is the greatest driver. • This ability of bone to buffer the blood is essential to the minute-to-minute regulation of plasma calcium. The substantial storage of calcium in bone allows for plasma calcium to be very tightly regulated, varying little despite changes in dietary intake and output.

The nephritogenic autoantibody is directed against a 28-kDa monomer located in the α chain of type IV collagen (Goodpasture antigen). Goodpasture syndrome and Goodpasture disease are often used synonymously to refer to anti-GBM antibody-mediated disease. However, some call it Goodpasture syndrome when glomerulonephritis is associated with pulmonary hemorrhage, irrespective of underlying etiology. Goodpasture disease is reserved for patients with anti-GBM antibody glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage, but may present with glomerulonephritis only. Anti-GBM disease in children is rare, accounting for 2.3% to 7.3% of cases of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in children. One study reported 4 cases over a 25-year time period. Some studies suggest an association with smoking and exposure to hydrocarbons. Light microscopy shows crescentic glomerulonephritis (Figure 1). The crescents are mostly cellular, but may show a variable degree of scarring and fibrosis. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates the pathognomonic finding of linear deposition of immunoglobulin G along the glomerular capillaries (Figure 2) and occasionally the distal tubules. In some cases, the tubular staining is associated with distinct circulating antitubular basement membrane antibodies and such patients show more severe tubulointerstitial disease characterized by interstitial infiltrate, fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. The antifibrinogen immunofluorescence stain is positive in the crescent (Figure 3).

      "lower 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 level Answer B Hypocalcemia is defined as serum calcium levels lower than 8 mg/dL (2 mmol/L) in full-term neonates and lower than 7 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) in premature neonates. During gestation, fetal calcium homeostasis is geared toward conserving and building the fetal skeleton. Serum calcium concentrations are higher in the fetus than the mother because of active placental transport. To maintain a stable maternal calcium balance, maternal 1-α hydroxylase activity in the placenta and kidney is increased, resulting in enhanced 1,25 (OH)2D3 synthesis; as a result, there is enhanced calcium absorption from the gut. The relative fetal hypercalcemia suppresses fetal parathyroid hormone (PTH) production. Accordingly, fetal and neonatal PTH levels are quite low. In contrast, high fetal calcitonin favors calcium deposition into bone. Although maternal 1,25-(OH)2D3 levels rise during pregnancy, fetal levels remain low because of conversion to inactive metabolites by the placenta. 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which is important for fetal bone growth and ossification, reaches the fetus by passive transfer through the placenta, and the fetal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is a reflection of maternal vitamin D status, ie, lower fetal level if maternal level is low. Following birth and cessation of transplacental calcium transport, intestinal calcium transport assumes the major source for calcium in the newborn. Healthy full term newborns undergo a physiologic nadir in serum calcium level by 24 to 48 hours of age. This nadir is exaggerated in high risk neonates, including neonates of diabetic mothers, preterm neonates, and neonates with perinatal asphyxia, causing hypocalcemia in the first 24 to 72 hours after birth. Hypomagnesemia may contribute to the decreased PTH response in neonates of diabetic mothers and those with perinatal asphyxia.

    "explanation": "A. abdominal hernias\nB. arachnoid cysts\nC. cerebral artery aneurysms\nD. liver cysts\nE. mitral valve prolapse\n\nAnswer D\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is usually caused by mutations in the\npolycystin-1 gene (or less commonly, the polycystin-2 gene [5%-10% of cases]). In the kidney, these\ngenes are expressed by tubular epithelial cells and regulate epithelial proliferation. Defects in the gene\nproducts lead to proliferation of the tubular epithelium and subsequent cyst formation. Using the\nRavine criteria, patients younger than 30 years of age who have 2 cysts and a positive family history\nof ADPKD meet the criteria for ADPKD. In patients without a family history, 5 cysts are required.\nThe extrarenal manifestations include the presence of cysts in other organs. Liver cysts (polycystic\nliver disease) may be found in approximately 60% of 15- to 24-year-old individuals with ADPKD, and\nthe prevalence rises to over 90% by the fourth decade of life. Although mostly asymptomatic,\ncomplications of these cysts are similar to the complications of the renal cysts such as pain,\nhemorrhage into cyst, and cyst infection.\nUp to 10% of older patients develop cysts in other organs, resulting in pancreatic, splenic, thyroid,\nand arachnoid cysts. Seminal vessel cysts may be present in 40% of male patients and may cause\nsome semen abnormalities; however, infertility is uncommon.\nOther areas of the body may also show abnormalities more often in ADPKD patients, including\ndilatation of the common bile duct, colonic diverticulae, abdominal and umbilical hernia (3 times more\nfrequent than unaffected family members), and bronchiectasis (3-fold prevalence compared to\ncontrols).\n\nCardiac abnormalities are common, with mitral valve prolapse being present in one-fourth of adult\npatients. In addition, patients may have dilation of the aortic root and aortic insufficiency. In patients\nwith progressed chronic kidney disease (CKD), pericardial effusion is over 3 times more common in\nADPKD patients compared with CKD controls.\nThe prevalence (8%) of intracerebral aneurysms in ADPKD patients is over 3 times that of the general\npopulation. Most of these are small (< 6 mm) and asymptomatic, and do not require intervention.\nIndications for screening for aneurysms include a high risk profession (eg, pilot), anticipated major\nsurgery, need for anticoagulation, and a family history of aneurysm rupture (screening usually\nrecommended 5 to 10 years before the age at which the youngest relative had aneurysm rupture).\nAneurysm rupture has been reported in a young child and a newborn, but overall, rupture is rare in\nthe pediatric age group and screening below 18 years of age is not usually recommended.\nChronic kidney disease may present at birth or be asymptomatic throughout life. At one extreme,\nsome infants may present with renal failure and rapidly enlarging kidneys requiring nephrectomy for\nrespiratory indications. At the other extreme, an elderly patient with mildly elevated creatinine may be\nfound to have ADPKD. In a series of 60 children with ADPKD comprised of 50 children with PKD1 and\n10 children with PKD2 mutations with an average age around 8.5 years, the children with PKD1\nmutations had more cysts and higher systolic blood pressure loads. Among this cohort, mean renal\nfunction was normal, which is consistent with the natural history of slow progression in most patients.\nThe long term data from adult series shows progression to end stage kidney disease or death at a\nmean age of 53 years for those with PKD1 and 69 years for those with PKD2, with a many fold higher\nprevalence of hypertension in the PKD1 patients. Adequate control of hypertension may slow\nprogression of CKD.\nRenal complications of ADPKD aside from CKD and hypertension include cyst pain, hemorrhage into\nthe cyst, and cyst infection. These may cause acute or chronic back pain. Urinary tract infections are\nalso more common in ADPKD patients (60% of adults in 1 series) than age-matched controls, and\npatients with signs and symptoms of pyelonephritis may need evaluation for cyst infection. The\ndiagnosis and management of infected kidney cysts requires a high index of suspicion because the\ntoxic-appearing patient with fever and pain may not have a positive urine culture. These patients may\nrequire surgical or radiologic interventions for a closed space infection. Nephrolithiasis is over 5 times\nmore common in ADPKD patients and a low urinary citrate and distal acidification defects are thought\nto contribute. Management for nephrolithiasis is similar to that recommended for non-ADPKD patients.\nPREP Pearls\n• Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) may involve the liver and other\norgans.\n• Nephrolithiasis in ADPKD is managed similar to other patients.\n• Intracerebral aneurysm are a rare but important complication that may be screened for in\nselect patients.\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n• Know the renal and nonrenal features of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,\nincluding their frequency in children\nSuggested Readings\n• Cadnapaphornchai MA.

Response choice B demonstrates immune complex deposits\nin the capillary walls, as would be seen in type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Response choice\nC shows deposits that are mesangial and paramesangial with sparing of the capillary loops, consistent with what is\ntypically seen in immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. The deposits stain for IgA and less so for complement\ncomponent 3 (C3). Response choice D is an excellent depiction of the focal deposits seen with focal segmental\nglomerulosclerosis. These are typically seen in sclerosed areas of the glomerulus and are comprised of C3 and\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM). Other immunoglobulins may be seen, but their presence is inconsistent and they usually\nstain less intensely than does IgM. The fifth micrograph (E) shows linear deposits along the capillary walls. This is\ntypical of Goodpasture syndrome. The linear deposits consist of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Staining for C3 is also\npositive and immunofluorescence shows discontinuous to granular capillary basement membrane staining.\nIn acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis, the glomeruli are enlarged with diffuse mesangial cell proliferation and\nmesangial expansion. Polymorphonuclear neutrophil exudation is more apparent early in the course of the disease.\nThe capillary loops are compressed and the tubules are mostly unaffected, except for the presence of red blood cell\ncasts. The interstitium is largely spared, although there can be cellular infiltrates. Immunofluorescent studies show\nfine granular deposits of IgG and C3 along the capillary walls. In some cases, C3 may be present without IgG. Two\npatterns are described, the first of which is shown in response choice A. The “starry sky” pattern is one of an irregular\nfinely granular pattern of C3 along the capillary loops and in the mesangium. When the inflammation is more severe,\na second “garland” pattern is seen. The garland pattern has numerous large, closely opposed granular deposits along\nthe capillary walls. The deposits represent subepithelial IgG and C3 deposition. Patients with this pattern usually have\nnephrotic range proteinuria as a component of their disease. The typical electron microscopic findings are subepithelial\n“humps,” although there may also be intramembranous and even subendothelial deposits early in the course of the\ndisease. Glomerular crescents rarely occur in patients with acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis.\nApproximately 90% of acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis occurs in young children after streptococcal pharyngeal\nor skin infections. The latency period from infection to presentation is 7 to 14 days for pharyngeal and 14 to 21 days\n\nfor postimpetigo disease. The diagnosis is made in a patient with abnormal urinalysis, evidence of recent streptococcal\ninfection, a positive ASO-titer or anti-DNase B titer, and hypocomplementemia (low C3 and normal complement\ncomponent 4 [C4]). The disease is usually self-limited and generally requires only supportive therapy. Resolution\noccurs over a period of weeks to months; clinical symptoms last a few days to a couple of weeks. There are usually no\npermanent sequelae in children. Adults may have a higher incidence of hypertension and chronic renal failure as a\nresult of acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis. Most children present with acute nephritic syndrome with hematuria,\nedema, and hypertension with or without oliguria (> 90%). Other less common presentations include nephrotic\nsyndrome, severe acute kidney injury with a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and hypertensive\nencephalopathy. Subclinical manifestations are 5 times more frequent than clinical disease, particularly during\nepidemics. The ASO titer and anti-DNase B are often elevated unless the patient has been treated with antibiotics.\nSerum concentrations of C3 are almost always depressed and C4 is low-normal in a quarter of the cases. The serum\nC3 concentration should be measured early in the course of the disease because it usually normalizes 4 to 8 weeks\nafter onset. The C3 should be remeasured 6 to 8 weeks after initial presentation to make sure that it has normalized.\nOngoing C3 activation suggests that there may be chronic glomerulonephritic process present. This includes C3\nglomerulopathy/MPGN.\nOther than acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis, glomerulonephritides that may present with a predominantly\nnephritic presentation include IgA nephropathy, Henoch-Schönlein nephritis, Alport hereditary nephritis, C3\nglomerulopathy/MPGN, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus nephritis, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis,\nhepatitis B membranous nephropathy, and antineutrophil-associated vasculitis.\nPREP Pearls\n Most children with acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis are not biopsied.\n Most children with acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis make a full spontaneous recovery.\n Hyperkalemia and hypertension can be life-threatening complications associated with acute postinfectious\nglomerulonephritis.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the differential diagnosis for the clinical presentation and histologic lesion of post-infectious\nglomerulonephritis\nSuggested Readings\n Eison TM, Ault BH, Jones DP, Chesney RW, Wyatt RJ.

This patient’s risk factors for cortical necrosis\nincluded perinatal asphyxia, anemia, hemolysis, sepsis, and shock. Additional risk factors in neonates for developing\ncortical necrosis include maternal-fetal transfusion, congenital heart disease, and dehydration. Cortical necrosis is the\nresult of ischemia to the renal cortex. Severely reduced renal perfusion may occur due to microvascular or\nmacrovascular processes. The degree of renal involvement may vary from small focal lesions (< 3 mm areas of\nnecrosis), patchy lesions with one-third to two-thirds of the renal cortex involved, to gross necrosis where only a thin\nsubcapsular rim of cortex and the juxtamedullary cortex is preserved. In areas without frank necrosis, the lesion of\nacute tubular necrosis is expected. In severe forms, patients typically develop oligoanuric renal failure requiring\ndialysis. In some patients, recovery occurs after prolonged support (months). Unilateral cortical necrosis is rare and\nusually associated with ureteric or renal artery obstruction.

Older\npatients may report flank pain.\nThe survival of infants with cortical necrosis is usually dictated by associated conditions (congenital heart disease,\ncentral nervous system disease, sepsis, etc) and the duration of oliguria and anuria in developed countries. This was\ndemonstrated in a large single center report over 25 years of 52 infants requiring dialysis (all causes), where the\npresence of anuria had an odds ratio for mortality of 41 in the presence of multiorgan dysfunction, chronic lung\ndisease, or defined congenital syndrome complex. In a large international multicenter series of neonates (264\npatients) requiring renal replacement, the presence of neurologic comorbidity was associated with a 5-fold increase in\nrisk of death. Notably in this series, 20% of newborns with cortical necrosis recovered renal function. Depending on\nthe etiology and severity of the cortical necrosis, the outcome is variable.\nIn older children, cortical necrosis is less common, and hemolytic uremic syndrome or gastroenteritis with severe\ndehydration are the leading causes. Other potential causes are listed in the Table\n\nIn most series in adults, about half of the cases of cortical necrosis are related to obstetrical complications. Before the\nadvent of early and modern dialytic intervention, mortality rates in adults ranged from 50% to 90%. Cortical necrosis\nis fairly common in neonatal deaths, and in 1 series, 5% of infants who died at younger than 3 months of age had\ncortical necrosis on autopsy.\nIn addition to cortical necrosis, the lesion of papillary necrosis warrants mention. In sickle cell disease and trait, sickle\ncells may occlude the vasa recta and medullary vessels leading to necrosis of the papillae. This may be focal or\nwidespread. The clinical presentation may vary from asymptomatic hematuria to an acute presentation with gross\nhematuria, back pain, and renal failure. Patients with higher levels of fetal hemoglobin or of hemoglobin A2 are at\nlower risk for papillary necrosis. Some form of papillary necrosis is seen in about 40% of patients with sickle cell\ndisease.\nAnalgesic nephropathy is a cause of papillary necrosis associated with massive chronic use (kilograms) of phenacetin\n(withdrawn in the United States) and acetaminophen, but can also occur with aspirin (ASA) and other nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Combination products (acetaminophen and ASA or NSAIDs) also present higher\n\nrisk. Use of these agents is usually associated with acute kidney injury and interstitial nephritis in children, but cases\nof papillary necrosis have been reported. Other causes of papillary necrosis include diabetes mellitus, infections\n(Candida, Actinomyces), tuberculosis, chronic liver disease, alcohol abuse, systemic vasculitis, and poisoning (toilet\nbowl cleaner). In severe cases, necrotic debris can cause unilateral or bilateral obstruction.\nPREP Pearls\n Papillary necrosis should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.\n Unlike many other forms of acute kidney injury, cortical necrosis portends long term kidney damage.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Recognize the clinical presentation and predisposing factors of cortical/medullary/papillary necrosis\nSuggested Readings\n Alhwiesh A.

    "explanation": "B. antibiotic prophylaxis\nIn children, primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is diagnosed most commonly after UTI or during follow-up for\nantenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis with no prior UTI. Secondary VUR may occur due to obstructive uropathy.\nSystematic reviews have revealed that VUR increases the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) and renal scarring, also\ncalled reflux nephropathy. The most important risk factors for RN include high-grade VUR and recurrent UTI. A\nsubstantial number of children experience spontaneous resolution of primary VUR (50-85% of cases with grade I-III).\nManagement of VUR is controversial and options include antimicrobial prophylaxis, surgical intervention, or\nsurveillance only. Of the different guidelines published on the subject, only those by the American Urological\nAssociation (AUA) address in depth the management of VUR in children. Other guidelines such as those by the\nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of Great Britain and the American Academy of Pediatrics\n(AAP) relate primarily to the management, including renal imaging for UTI. Both base their recommendations on the\nargument that VUR, particularly low-grade, does not increase the risk of UTI and renal scarring and antimicrobial\nprophylaxis does not reduce the risk of UTI in children with VUR.\nAUA recommendations depend on the child’s age at diagnosis of VUR. For children younger than 1 year of age at\ndiagnosis of VUR with a history of a febrile UTI, the AUA recommends continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for all grades\nof VUR. In the absence of an antecedent UTI, those younger than 1 year of age with grade III–IV VUR are\nrecommended to receive continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, while antibiotic prophylaxis in those with grade I–II VUR is\nan option. In children older than 1 year of age at diagnosis of VUR, antibiotic prophylaxis is a “recommendation” if the\nVUR is associated with recurrent febrile UTI, bladder-bowel dysfunction, or renal cortical abnormalities; in the absence\nof these conditions, antibiotic prophylaxis is an “option.” Similar recommendations have been made in children with\nbreakthrough UTI, which also include the option for consideration of endoscopic or surgical correction of VUR.\nRecently, the Randomized Intervention for Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) study showed that compared\nto placebo, antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole reduces the risk of UTI recurrences by 50%\n(hazard ratio 0.50; 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.74) in children with VUR, and was most effective in children who\npresented with a febrile UTI or bladder dysfunction. No significant difference was seen in renal scarring between the 2\ngroups. However, this does not invalidate the role of prophylaxis in preventing renal scars because RIVUR and other\nrecent prospective studies were not designed to address renal scarring as a primary study endpoint. In view of the\nRIVUR Trial and other studies that showed similar results, albeit in selected groups of patients, the investigators of the\nRIVUR trial concluded that antimicrobial prophylaxis has a role in the prevention of UTI recurrence in children with\nVUR and should be used selectively- selective prophylaxis.\nSurgical treatment offers the quickest possible correction of the VUR, but has not been shown to be superior to\nantimicrobial prophylaxis as for as recurrence of UTI or renal scarring are concerned. This is supported by several\nmulticenter studies. Surgical treatment is generally recommended in patients with high grade VUR (IV and V), those\nin whom antimicrobial prophylaxis is ineffective, as demonstrated by breakthrough UTI’s, patients allergic to\nantimicrobials, those with poor adherence or worsening of scars, and those in whom the parents prefer surgical\ncorrection. Currently, endoscopic treatment of reflux involving subureteral or intraureteral injection of dextranomer\nhyaluronidase (Deflux®) is offered as the first-line surgical treatment in most cases. Other surgical options include\nlaparoscopic or open surgical reimplantation, the latter being the gold standard for VUR surgery with about a 98%\nsuccess rate.\n\nFor the infant in the vignette who presented with a febrile UTI and has moderate degree VUR, the best management\noption as per AUA guidelines and consistent with the RIVUR trial results is to provide antibiotic prophylaxis. This is\nparticularly important because of the morbidity associated with UTI recurrence in very young children and other issues\nsuch as non-specific clinical presentation, difficulty in getting urine specimens, potential oral medication intolerance,\nhigher possibility of a need for hospitalization for IV antibiotic administration & hydration, increased risk of septicemia\nwith UTI, and family disruption and parental anxiety. Surgical interventions such as Deflux procedure or ureteral\nreimplantation are not warranted at this time, but may be necessary depending on the patient’s clinical course.\nLong term follow-up of VUR depends on the extent and bilaterality of VUR and management (ie, medical versus\nsurgical). Surgery does have the advantage of not requiring follow-up VCUGs to the extent needed in patients on\nantimicrobial prophylaxis.\nThe follow-up of patients on antimicrobial prophylaxis consists of monitoring for UTI recurrence, follow-up VCUG once\nevery 1-2 years (depending on severity and clinical course), and DMSA renal scan in selected patients to diagnose and\nmonitor renal scarring and differential renal function. Once follow-up imaging demonstrates resolution of VUR, the\nprophylaxis is discontinued. In boys with persistent vesicoureteral reflux who have not had recurrent UTIs, antibiotics\nare often discontinued as the boys approach puberty. However, because of concerns about future pregnancies,\nsurgery may be recommended in girls approaching puberty who have persistent vesicoureteral reflux. Circumcision\nshould be considered in boys with high-grade VUR particularly in presence of recurrent UTIs. Bladder- bowel\ndysfunction (previously called dysfunctional elimination syndrome) of which chronic constipation is a key element,\nshould be managed appropriately because it increases the risk of UTI recurrence and delays the resolution of VUR.\nPREP Pearls\n No evidence-based guidelines exist for appropriate follow-up or the management of patients with\nvesicoureteral reflux(VUR)\n The debate on antimicrobial prophylaxis should shift from \"no prophylaxis\" to \"selective prophylaxis\" in\nchildren with VUR\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the clinical management and long-term follow-up of different grades of vesicoureteral reflux\nSuggested Readings\n Diamond DA, Mattoo TK (2012).

Rapidly\nprogressive glomerulonephritis and renal biopsy findings of crescents with pauci-immune focal segmental necrotizing\nglomerulonephritis are the most common renal manifestations, affecting 40% to 100% of patients. Patients may also\nhave ear, nose, or throat (70-100%) and lung involvement (50-90%). Over 50% have nonspecific constitutional signs\n(eg, fever, weight loss). Over 90% of patients with GPA will have a positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody\n(ANCA) with antiproteinase 3 (PR3).\nNinety percent of patients enter remission with induction therapy, but over 50% relapse. Glucocorticoids are used for\nboth induction and maintenance. Complications include weight gain, hyperglycemia, easy bruising, mood swings, risk\nof infection, cataracts, hypertension, osteoporosis, Cushing syndrome, and fractures.\nMost ANCA vasculitides involving the kidney requires a second therapeutic agent in addition to steroids. Intravenous\npulse cyclophosphamide, daily oral cyclophosphamide, or more recently, rituximab, are used as additional induction\nagents. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that is cytotoxic to both B and T cells. The cumulative oral dose of 6\nmonths of cyclophosphamide is higher than with intravenous pulse, so it may pose a higher risk for long term\ncomplications. For either intravenous or oral cyclophosphamide, there is a long term risk of infertility and malignancy\n(eg, bladder cancer), especially for a lifetime exposure of greater than 35 g. For females, use of cyclophosphamide\nafter the onset of menarche poses a higher risk for infertility than use prior to the onset of menarche. Other risks of\ncyclophosphamide include hemorrhagic cystitis, cytopenia, hair loss, and gastrointestinal adverse effects. It is also a\nteratogen and should not be used in pregnant women.\nRituximab is a newer option that is being used in patients that fail cyclophosphamide or in patients with\ncontraindications to cyclophosphamide. Its adverse effects include infusion reactions, infection, and a rare, but serious\ncomplication of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\nMethotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine are more often used for maintenance. All 3 have risks of hair\nloss, cytopenia, liver dysfunction, mouth ulcers, and gastrointestinal adverse effects. Methotrexate is to be avoided in\npatients with renal dysfunction.\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a potential alternative treatment for ANCA vasculitis (AASV) with less toxicity\nthan conventional immunosuppressive agents. However, its role in the management of ANCA vasculitis has not been\nclearly defined and may be considered in those who fail to respond to standard therapy or have a relapse. Potential\nadverse effects of IVIG include headache, skin rash, anaphylactic reaction, pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury,\nvenous thrombosis, and aseptic meningitis.\nPREP Pearls\n Over 90% of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) will have a positive antineutrophil\ncytoplasmic antibody with antiproteinase 3 (PR3).\n Induction treatment with daily oral cyclophosphamide results in a higher cumulative dose over 6 months, and\nlifetime dosage correlates with risk of infertility.\n Induction with steroids and intravenous cyclophosphamide are frequently used for patients with renal\nmanifestations of GPA. Short term risks of cyclophosphamide include teratogenicity and cytopenia.

This condition is not\nuncommon in adults, but is rare in children.\n1. Clinical features that are included in some definitions of HRS comprise:\n2. A progressive rise in serum creatinine;\n3. A benign looking urine sediment; Nil or minimal proteinuria;\n4. A very low rate of sodium excretion (ie, urine sodium concentration less than 10 mEq/L);\n5. Oliguria in most, but not all cases.\nAdditional or more specific clinical criteria used by others are shown in Table 1.\n\nTo bring some consistency in defining HRS, the International Ascites Club proposed diagnostic criteria in adults in\n1996 and revised the same a decade later. These current criteria include:\n Cirrhosis with ascites\n Serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL (133 µmol/L).\n No improvement in serum creatinine (decrease to a level of 1.5 mg/dL or less) after at least 2 days of diuretic\nwithdrawal and volume expansion with albumin. The recommended dose of albumin is 1 g/kg of body weight\nper day up to a maximum of 100 g/day.\n Absence of shock.\n No current or recent treatment with nephrotoxic drugs.\n Absence of parenchymal kidney disease as indicated by proteinuria greater than 500 mg/day, microhematuria,\nand abnormal renal ultrasound findings In this revised definition, creatinine clearance was removed as a\nmeasure of renal function because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate urine collection data, the removal of\nongoing bacterial infection as an exclusion criterion so that treatment of HRS is not delayed in these patients,\nthe substitution of saline with albumin as the preferred fluid for plasma volume expansion, and the removal of\nall the minor criteria because they are thought not to be essential.\nPathophysiologically, liver failure and portal hypertension initiate through endotoxemia and increased shear stress, an\nincrease in the vascular production of vasodilators, including nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and glucagon in the\nsplanchnic circulation. These vasodilators lead to marked vasodilation of the splanchnic circulation resulting in\nreduction of systemic vascular resistance and transient arterial hypotension. Then the systemic vascular resistance\ndrops, compensated initially by hyperdynamic cardiac activity and systemic vasoconstrictor responses. The net effect\nin the kidney is renal vasoconstriction, low glomerular filtration rate, and enhanced sodium and water retention.\nThe differential diagnosis, as might be expected, includes prerenal azotemia, acute interstitial nephritis, and acute\ntubular necrosis. In prerenal azotemia, the response to sustained plasma expansion is good. Acute interstitial nephritis\ncan have elevated serum creatinine and can also have a benign urinary sediment, but would be characterized by low\nurine specific gravity in the setting of an appropriate risk agent. In acute tubular necrosis, the following features are\nnoted:\n Urinary sodium greater than 30 mEq/L\n Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) greater than 1.5%,\n Urine:plasma creatinine ratio less than 30\n Urine/plasma osmolality ratio of 1\n Urine sediment reveals casts and cellular debris\n No significant response to sustained plasma expansion\nOne must also rule out a pseudohepatorenal syndrome, a concurrent hepatic and renal dysfunction secondary to a\nwide variety of infectious, systemic, circulatory, genetic, and other diseases and after exposure to a variety of drugs\nand toxins.

Figure D.\nMulticystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is more common in males, often unilateral, and mostly affects the left kidney.\nMCDK are nonfunctional, with lack of perfusion on 99Tc Mag3 or DTPA renal scans. MCDK can be associated with\nobstruction and vesicoureteral reflux, particularly in the ureter of the contralateral kidney. Systemic hypertension is a\npotential complication of MCDK. Most often, the MCDK will involute over time, but in some cases, a unilateral\nnephrectomy may be indicated if the kidney fails to involute or increases in size. Mutations in a renal developmental\ngene, HNF1β, have been associated with MCDK.\nMCDK lack lobular organization and the ureter is usually atretic. On histologic examination, the affected kidney shows\naberrations of renal differentiation by poorly differentiated nephrons, which may not even be present, dysplastic\ncollecting ducts, cysts originating from collecting ducts, a fibrous stroma with undifferentiated mesenchyme, and\ncartilage. The cysts are often unconnected and of varying size, and there is no normal renal parenchyma between the\ncysts (Figure D).\nThe following conditions must be distinguished from MCDK:\n• Simple renal cysts, which in children are mostly unilateral, few in number, small (< 4 cm) in size, and lined by a\nsingle layer of cells.\n• Obstructive dysplastic kidneys will exhibit a massively dilated renal pelvis, with dysplastic tubules.\n• Tuberous sclerosis may present with angiomyolipomas, which will appear as hyperechoic lesions in the cortex.\nMagnetic resonance imaging will demonstrate high fat content of the lesions. On histology, angiomyolipomas are\ncomposed of blood vessels, spindle cells, and adipose tissue.\n• Von Hippel–Lindau syndrome (vHL) will manifest as clear cell renal cell carcinoma. vHL can also be associated with\ncortical renal cysts.\nFigure A shows normal renal medulla with normal renal tubules and interstitium.\n\nFigure A.\nFigure B shows renal dysplasia. Cystic dysplastic kidneys will appear echogenic with poor corticomedullary\ndifferentiation on renal ultrasound. On histology, there will be similar findings to MCDK of dysplastic tubules (primitive\ntubules surrounded by stroma and smooth muscle collars, and metaplastic cartilage). The difference lies in the\nnumber of cysts and presence of areas of normal renal parenchyma. In MCDK, there are numerous large cysts,\nwhereas cystic dysplastic kidneys tend to have a few scattered cortical cysts and may have intact deeper renal\nparenchyma. Cystic dysplastic kidneys have some function, which may last a variable length of time, depending on\nthe number of functioning nephrons.\nFigure B.\nFigure C demonstrates cortical cyst characteristic of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which\nmost often presents in infancy with bilateral large echogenic kidneys with poor corticomedullary differentiation.\nAutosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is caused by mutations in PKHD1, a large gene that encodes fibrocystin\nor polyductin. Cysts in ARPKD originate in the collecting ducts at the corticomedullary junction.\nFigure C.\n\nFigure E demonstrates cysts in the medulla present in medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD). Medullary cystic\nkidney disease and nephronophthisis (NPH) both are associated with cysts originating at the corticomedullary junction,\nand the spectrum of MCKD-NPH is one class of cystic kidney disease. MCKD is autosomal dominant, and is associated\nwith mutations in MUC1 (MCKD type 1) and UMOD (MCKD type 2). MCKD type 2 is associated with hyperuricemia and\nis also called familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. Nephronophthisis is an autosomal recessive disease and\nmutations in numerous ciliary genes have been identified in association with NPH.

    "explanation": "E. upregulation of Toll-like receptors in damaged proximal tubule\nThe patient in the vignette developed acute kidney injury due to renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) caused by\ndehydration and the administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. The pathological lesion, acute tubular\nnecrosis (ATN), is the commonly used description for this type of acute kidney injury. Clinically, it is manifested by a\nprogressive rise in serum creatinine, abnormal urinalysis, elevated urinary fractional excretion of sodium, and oliguria,\nalthough urine output may be normal. Energy depletion predominatly affects the tubular segments with the highest\nmetabolic rate such as the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb of Henle. Ischemia-reperfusion injury for renal\ncells is a multifactorial process and therefore involves several pathophysiological mechanisms:\n1. Reduction in renal blood flow: severe reduction in effective intravascular volume due to extracellular fluid losses\n(eg, dehydration in this vignette), or significant blood losses (eg, hemorrhage due to trauma or surgery) lead to\nreduction in renal perfusion. Experimental evidence indicates that the decrease in renal blood flow is only about 40%\nto 50%, which by itself cannot fully account for the progressive and severe reduction in glomerular filtration rate\nobserved in ischemic ATN.\n2. Redistribution of intrarenal blood flow leading to reduced outer medullary blood flow: this results in peritubular\ncapillary congestion, peritubular hypoxia, and endothelial dysfunction.\n3. Endothelial cell injury: This process results in release of potent vasoconstrictors, endothelin 1, angiotensin II, and\nlipooxygenase products, which leads to intense renal vasoconstriction. Moreover, endothelial injury causes decreased\nsynthesis of vasodilatory endothelial-derived nitric oxide and de novo expression of adhesion molecules, such as\nICAM-1 and various cytokines, leading to recruitment and attachment of inflammatory cells. In addition, local\ncomplement activation contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and cytokine release.\n4. Intratubular obstruction due to denudation of the renal tubular cells: Cell-matrix adhesion molecules (eg,\nintegrins), normally expressed on the basolateral membrane, become mislocalized to the luminal aspect of the\nproximal tubular cell. Sloughing of these cells results in their clumping by integrin-matrix interactions and formation of\nintratubular casts and tubular obstruction. Tubular cell loss also leads to backleak of the glomerular filtrate, which\ncontributes to reduced distal nephron delivery. The latter effect is sensed by the macula densa, causing afferent\narteriolar vasoconstriction via the tubule-glomeular feedback mechanism.\nThe correct answer is upregulated expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the proximal tubular cells. The TLRs are\npattern-recognition receptors that can recognize bacterial pathogens, as well as various intracellular contents released\nfrom damaged cells. Engagement of TLR activates the innate immunity and enables inflammatory mediators, further\nworsening renal cell injury.\nPREP Pearls\n Ischemia-reperfusion injury does not cause complete cessation of renal blood flow; rather the injury leading to\nacute renal failure is multifactorial in origin.\n Decreased glomerular filtration rate, tubular obstruction by casts, and backleak of ultrafiltrate are important\nfactors, leading to oliguria and to activation of the tubuloglomerular feedback pathway.\n\n Upregulation of Toll-like receptors on the proximal tubular cells initiate a self-pepetuating cycle, leading to\nactivation of the innate immune system and local inflammatory response.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the events involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury\nSuggested Readings\n Basu RK, Devarajan P, Wong H, Wheeler DS.

    "explanation": "C. linear immunofluorescence positivity\nThe patient in this vignette has features that are classic for Alport syndrome, a hereditary nephritis characterized by\nhematuria, progressive renal failure, and hearing loss in multiple family members. The genetic inheritance is X-linked\nin most cases, but may also be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. In Alport syndrome, the underlying\ndisorder is one of several possible mutations in the collagen IV A3, A4, or A5 genes that code respectively for α3, α4,\nand α5 collagen in the trimers in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). When patients with Alport syndrome\nreceive a kidney transplant, the new kidney does not lack these trimers, which are therefore new antigens to the\nrecipient’s immune system. Approximately 3% to 5% of the recipients then mount antibodies to newly perceived\ntrimers, resulting in a de novo anti-GBM disease, characterized by new onset hematuria and renal function\nimpairment, plus a linear immunoglobulin G immunofluorescence deposition pattern on renal transplant biopsy\n(Figure).\nFigure\nThis is in contrast to native kidney anti-GBM disease, where the autoimmune antibodies are directed towards\npreexisting antigens in the noncollagenous domain of α3 or α5 in the type IV collagen.\nThis situation is a variant type of recurrent disease in the allograft. Many other primary renal diseases can show a\nmore classical recurrence in the allograft. These diseases may be classified as primary glomerular diseases, secondary\nglomerular disease, or inherited systemic diseases (Table).\nTable.

In inherited genetic diseases, the underlying genetic abnormality is not\ncorrected by the presence of a new kidney. The new allograft kidney suffers the same attack as the native kidney. An\nexception to this statement is the membrane cofactor protein deficient type of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.\nPrimary glomerular diseases are largely caused by aberrations in the systemic immune system, with the kidney being\na major point of attack. Transplant kidneys therefore undergo the same attack as the native kidney. However, our\nunderstanding of the pathophysiology of the primary and recurrent diseases is very incomplete. Therefore, the clinical\nrecurrence rates vary widely within a disease entity and across all the disease entities that may recur (Table). Not all\nrecurrences manifest clinically, such that pathologic recurrent rates, when checked for or known, are higher than\nclinical recurrence rates. Attributable graft loss rates after recurrence also vary widely by disease. In anti-GBM\ndisease, the attributable graft loss rate is very high. Treatment of recurrent disease varies by the disease.\nIn the vignette, the clinical features are most suggestive of anti-GBM disease after Alport syndrome, with linear\nimmunofluorescence pattern as a diagnostic feature. Linear immunofluorescence pattern is also a characteristic\nfeature of Goodpasture disease, which has a very low risk of recurrence in a renal graft.

      "up to 3% of cells in the embryonic kidney are undergoing apoptosis Answer E Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a form of cell death in which nuclear condensation and fragmentation are followed by cytoplasmic shrinkage with preservation of cytoplasmic organelles. This occurs without spillage of intracellular material, hence the lack of inflammation. Cellular fragments, ie, apoptotic bodies, are eventually phagocytosed by neighboring cells or macrophages. Apoptosis plays a key role in various developmental processes, but especially in determining organ size and patterning. For example, it is responsible for clonal deletion during thymic development and formation of digits as the interdigital cells die. Kidney development depends on reciprocal interactions between the ureteric bud (UB), an epithelial outgrowth of the Wolffian duct, and the metanephric blastema in the caudal end of the intermediate mesoderm. Initial studies suggested that, unlike the case in neurogenesis, apoptosis is a rare event during nephrogenesis. However, later studies performed in embryonic kidneys demonstrated up to 3% of cells in the nephrogenic zone and renal papilla are undergoing apoptosis. Since apoptotic cells are cleared rapidly (average clearance time 1-2 hours), this level of involvement greatly underestimates the extent of apoptosis in the developing kidney. In the nephrogenic zone, where mesenchymal nephron progenitors are continuously being induced by the adjacent UB, apoptosis is observed in mesenchymal cells distant from the UB tip, suggesting that cell to cell contact or a diffusion gradient of a critical growth differentiation factor may be the driving force for rescue of the mesenchyme from apoptosis. Inhibition of apoptosis disrupts nephrogenesis, probably by impairing the patterning of the mesenchyme. In the medulla, apoptotic cells are mostly observed outside the collecting tubules and elimination of excess cells probably provides space for branching morphogenesis and elongation to occur. In addition to secreted factors from the mesenchymal and epithelial cells, such as bone morphogenetic protein-7, epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor α, and angiotensin II, there exist intrinsic factors within the mesenchyme and epithelium, which inhibit apoptosis. The latter category includes transcriptional regulators such as Pax2 and WT1, and inhibitors of apoptosis such as Bcl2, Mdm2, and various micro-RNAs. Thus, nephron induction is a 3-step process: initial rescue of mesenchyme apoptosis, followed by proliferation and differentiation. The 3 processes are exquisitely well coordinated, such that a slight delay in the timing of induction of the mesenchyme by the UB may provoke apoptosis.It is therefore not surprising that unilateral renal agenesis is a relatively common anomaly in humans. PREP Pearls  Apoptosis is a relatively frequent and key event in nephron morphogenesis.  Uncontrolled apoptosis, such as in growth factor deprivation or loss of endogenous apoptosis inhibitors, impairs kidney development.  Rescue of mesenchyme apoptosis is the first step of nephron induction, preceding proliferation and differentiation.

      "antistreptolysin antibody titer (ASO)",
      "complement component 3 and complement component 4 (C3 and C4) Answer B The hypertension, edema, gross hematuria, and acute kidney injury are diagnostic of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). There are multiple causes of RPGN, including postinfectious glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)- positive glomerulonephritis, and Goodpasture syndrome. The clinical pattern of RPGN with lung lesions and sinusitis is highly suggestive of ANCA-positive glomerulonephritis, in particular, granulomatosis with polyangitis (GPA). In this patient, the diagnosis is most likely going to be determined with an ANCA test. ANCA-positive vasculitis typically involves the small to medium-sized vessels. The 2 most common target antigens are proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Both PR3 and MPO are located in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and the peroxidase-positive lysosomes of monocytes. Autoantibodies with target specificities for PR3 and MPO are called PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA, respectively. With the C-ANCA pattern, the immunofluorescence staining is diffuse throughout the cytoplasm, while the perinuclear or P-ANCA pattern features a staining pattern around the nucleus, which represents an artifact of ethanol fixation. With ethanol fixation of the neutrophil substrate, positively charged granule constituents rearrange themselves around the negatively charged nuclear membrane, leading to perinuclear fluorescence. It should be noted that there are cases of ANCA vasculitis in which either the C-ANCA or P-ANCA staining pattern is atypical and the bacterial permeability increasing factors are occasionally the target antigen for P-ANCA. Approximately 90% of patients with GPA (previously called Wegener granulomatosis) are ANCA- positive. There is a small subset of patients with active, generalized GPA who do not have ANCA. Thus, the absence of ANCA does not exclude the diagnosis of GPA. Among GPA patients with ANCA positivity, 80% to 90% are C-ANCA (PR3-ANCA) positive. The remainder of ANCA-positive GPA patients are P-ANCA (MPO-ANCA) positive. Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, which is the characteristic histopathologic lesion of GPA, has been reported in both PR3- and MPO-ANCA-positive individuals. Approximately 70% of patients with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are ANCA-positive. In contrast to GPA, most ANCA-positive MPA patients are P-ANCA (MPO-ANCA) positive, while a minority are C-ANCA (PR3-ANCA) positive. A multiplanar sinus computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging study for evaluating chronic sinusitis in GPA. In a case series of 28 patients with sinonasal GPA, the most common findings on sinus CT were mucosal thickening in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses in 61% and 75%, respectively. Additional findings from those studies showed bony destruction of the nasal cavity (57%), bony destruction of the paranasal sinuses (54%), subtotal sinus opacifications (25%), and bony thickening (sclerosing osteitis) of the paranasal sinuses (18%). Pulmonary involvement in GPA includes nodules that may cavitate, hazy opacifications, atelectasis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Antiglomerular basement membrane antibody disease is not the preferred response because while it can result in RPGN, it features pulmonary hemorrhage not sinusitis. Antinuclear antibody, which is important in the diagnosis of SLE, is not the preferred response; SLE has multiple systemic manifestations including serositis, hematological abnormalities, rash, fever, and gastrointestinal involvement that are not present in this case. Antistreptolysin antibody titer is also an incorrect choice, as it is usually positive in postinfectious glomerulonephritis which this patent does not have, but is also a nonspecific test (positive in 17% to 18% of healthy children). Complement component 3 and complement component 4 levels are not the correct answer, as these are low in many other causes of glomerulonephritis and only occasionally in GPA. ANCA positivity has been reported in many inflammatory rheumatic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, inflammatory myopathies, juvenile chronic arthritis, reactive arthritis, relapsing polychondritis, scleroderma, and the antiphospholipid syndrome. In most cases, the immunofluorescence pattern is P-ANCA. Atypical fluorescence patterns also occur in these settings, while C-ANCA patterns are rare. The clinical significance of the nonspecific findings in these disorders is unclear. ANCA positivity is seen in 60 to 80 percent of patients with ulcerative colitis and the related disorder primary sclerosing cholangitis. It is observed in only 10 to 27 percent of patients with Crohn's disease, in whom only low titers are present. The pathogenetic significance of these antibodies is unclear. The titers of ANCA do not vary with the activity or severity of the disease and, in ulcerative colitis, do not fall after colectomy. Non-MPO P-ANCA are common in patients with cystic fibrosis, particularly among those with bacterial airway infections. It is unclear whether this relationship represents an epiphenomenon or a response (adaptive or maladaptive) to gram-negative infection with release of endotoxin. ANCA positivity has also been occasionally detected in isolated patients with autoimmune hepatitis, leprosy, malaria, preeclampsia and eclampsia, subacute bacterial endocarditis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, chronic graft-versus-host disease, acute parvovirus B19 infection, acute infectious mononucleosis, and cocaine-induced osteochondral destruction.

      "organic acidemia",
      "renal tubular acidosis type I",
      "renal tubular acidosis type II",
      "renal tubular acidosis type IV Answer D The most likely diagnosis in this patient is type II renal tubular acidosis (RTA), supported by the presence of a nonanion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in the absence of diarrhea with a slightly low serum potassium level. In children, RTA is caused by either an inherited or acquired defect that affects the kidney's ability to reabsorb filtered bicarbonate, or excrete ammonia or titratable acid. Renal tubular acidosis is characterized by a normal anion gap and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. There are 4 subgroups of RTA including type I RTA (distal RTA), type II RTA (proximal RTA), type III RTA (mixed RTA), which is quite rare, and type IV RTA (hyperkalemic RTA). The most common forms of RTA in children are types I and II. Proximal RTA may present either as an isolated tubular defect or as a component of a generalized proximal tubular disorder called Fanconi syndrome. Type I RTA results from a defect of ammoniagenesis, type II RTA results from a defect in maximal reabsorption of bicarbonate, type III has features of type I and II RTA, while type IV RTA results from a defect in aldosterone production or action. When evaluating a child with metabolic acidosis, it is first important to calculate the anion gap; RTA is associated with a nonanion gap acidosis. The serum anion gap is usually calculated by [Na+] – [Cl-] – [HCO ] and normal is 12 +/- 4 mEq/L (depending on the laboratory and age of the patient). When a 3 normal anion gap acidosis is confirmed, other causes of nonanion gap acidosis need to be considered. The most common cause other than RTA is stool losses of bicarbonate, as can occur with diarrhea. In the absence of other causes, an evaluation for RTA is warranted. Urine pH (with a pH electrode) and urine electrolytes to calculate the urine anion gap are needed to further evaluate RTA; the urine anion gap is an indirect way to estimate urinary ammonia concentration. Patients with normal renal function and normal renal acidification mechanisms who develop metabolic acidosis usually have a urine pH of 5.3 or less. In most cases of distal RTA, the urine pH is persistently 5.5 or higher as a result of the primary defect in distal acidification, and generally a urine pH below 5.5 excludes distal but not proximal RTA. In proximal RTA, the urine pH is variable and depends on the serum bicarbonate level. For example, the urine pH is higher when the serum bicarbonate is above the renal threshold. In proximal RTA, treatment with alkali may increase the serum bicarbonate concentration enough to produce a filtered bicarbonate load that exceeds the reduced proximal re- absorptive capacity. Measuring the fractional excretion of bicarbonate when the patient is treated with bicarbonate therapy can confirm proximal RTA when the fractional excretion of bicarbonate is greater than 15%. In contrast, once the serum bicarbonate concentration has fallen sufficiently so that all of the filtered bicarbonate can be reabsorbed, the distal nephron maximally excretes acid, resulting in a urine pH of 5.3 or less. In type IV RTA, the urine pH is variable. The urine anion gap is calculated by urine [Na+] + [K+] – [Cl-]. While ammonium excretion is not directly measured, since ammonium is excreted as along with chloride as ammonium chloride, one can estimate ammonium excretion (and therefore renal ammonia production) by measuring chloride excretion. In turn, a positive urine anion gap indicates higher Na and K versus Cl excretion, and therefore, inadequate ammonium production by the distal nephron, while a negative urine anion gap indicates adequate ammonium production, as seen in proximal RTA (Figure 1). In type IV RTA, the characteristic laboratory finding is a nonacid gap metabolic acidosis with hyperkalemia due to inadequate production of renin by the kidney, inadequate production of aldosterone by the adrenal gland, or renal resistance to aldosterone. The child in the vignette does not have an organic acidemia as the cause of metabolic acidosis because organic acidemia causes a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Ingestion of ethylene glycol would also result in a high anion gap acidosis. The child does not have type I (distal) RTA because the urine pH is less than 5.5 (would be more alkaline) and the urine anion gap is negative (would be positive). Finally, type IV RTA is not correct because the serum potassium level is low. There are many different causes of distal (type I) RTA, proximal (type II) RTA, and hyperkalemic (type IV) RTA. The common causes of each type of RTA is shown in Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4.

      "decrease the antibiotic dose",

      "increase the antibiotic dosing interval",
      "increase the dialysate flow rate",
      "increase the total fluid removal Answer A Drug pharmacokinetics are significantly altered in renal failure. The most direct effect is the rate of excretion, as most drugs and their metabolites are cleared by the kidneys. In fact, if renal clearance contributes greater than 25% of the total drug clearance, then drug accumulation and possible toxicity becomes more likely in acute or chronic renal failure unless dosing modifications are made. However, excretion is not the only pharmacokinetic process modified in renal failure, as absorption, distribution, and metabolism may also be affected. Drug absorption of enterally administered medications can be altered from gastrointestinal wall edema, gastroparesis, or the use of other medications (such as phosphate binders or acid blockers) common in end stage renal disease. The volume of distribution (V ) of drugs can fluctuate with d changing fluid status, as volume overload increases V while contraction decreases V . The V is one of d d d the primary considerations in determining the loading dose of intravenous medications, so this may need to be taken into account for initial dosing. Protein binding may vary with lower albumin levels or from the direct effect of accumulated metabolites on binding. Acidic drugs, like warfarin or sulfonamides, may be competitively inhibited by accumulated organic acids, leading to less protein binding and higher free (active) drug levels in the blood. Basic drugs, like propranolol or diltiazem, may bind proteins more readily in the setting of acidosis, resulting in increased protein binding. A small number of drugs have intrarenal metabolism, mainly by tubular peptidases, but a vast majority are hepatically metabolized. However, endogenous inhibitors of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes may also accumulate in renal failure and downregulate the hepatic metabolism of drugs as well. The effects on hepatic metabolism seem to be more pronounced with end stage renal disease than with acute kidney injury. Like with renal clearance, the different pharmacokinetic properties of drugs need to be taken into account when determining their likelihood of dialytic clearance and impact of dosing with renal replacement therapies. These properties include the drug’s water solubility, percent protein bound, Vd, and molecular weight. Drugs that have greater water solubility, less protein binding (< 80%), lower V d (<1 L/kg), and lower molecular weight (< 1,000 Daltons) are more easily dialyzed, in general. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is felt to remove highly protein-bound drugs more readily than hemodialysis (HD), given the protein losses observed in PD, but is likely less overall effective in clearance of most dialyzable drugs. When thinking about factors influencing dialytic clearance, it is important to consider the method of clearance, especially when using continuous renal replacement therapy. Low molecular weight drugs may be removed more effectively by diffusion. The measure of a drug’s ability to be removed by diffusion is measured by the saturation coefficient, Sd: Saturation Coefficient (S )= drug concentration (dialysate)/drug concentration (plasma) d which is influenced primarily by the drug’s protein binding. The ability to clear the drug is the product of the saturation coefficient, S , and the dialysate flow rate, Q : d d Clearance (HD or CVVHD)= Q x S d d With low molecular weight drugs, increasing the dialysate flow rate could lower drug levels. This impact would also be greater in CVVHD than in intermittent HD, as the blood flow is so much greater than dialysate flow such that the dialysate flow becomes more of a limiting factor. Similarly, the clearance of middle size molecules is more dependent on convective clearance. The measure of a drug’s ability to be removed by convection is measured by the sieving coefficient, S : c Sieving Coefficient (S )= drug concentration (ultrafiltrate)/drug concentration (plasma) c which is also influenced primarily by the drug’s protein binding. The ability to clear the drug is the product of the sieving coefficient, S , and the ultrafiltration flow rate, Q : c UF Clearance (HD or CVVH)= Q x S UF c Unlike in CVVH, when the amount of fluid removed can be altered by increasing the replacement fluid rate, the amount of total fluid removed in intermittent HD will be limited by the patient’s hemodynamic tolerance of greater fluid removal, and its impact on drug removal may be limited. Additionally, greater fluid removal can potentially lead to increased drug levels, as the V would be d decreased. Vancomycin is highly soluble in water but also has a somewhat larger molecular weight, especially compared to other antibiotics, at 1,486 Daltons. It also happens to have a low V (0.4-1 L/kg) and low d protein binding (50-55%), which are even lower (0.7-0.9 L/kg and 20%, respectively) in end stage renal disease patients. Historically, however, vancomycin was not as easily dialyzable because of its larger molecular weight. Nowadays, with the regular use of high flux dialyzers and improved convective clearance, vancomycin can be cleared rather well with levels being decreased 30% to 50% with single treatments. Antibiotics also have other factors which may influence decisions on their dosing, including the site and severity of infection, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed, and their pharmacodynamics. Some antibiotics have concentration dependent killing properties, meaning their effectiveness is largely based on achieving peak concentrations relatively greater than the MIC, such as aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and metronidazole. Other antibiotics are time dependent with their killing properties, meaning they are more effective the longer interval that the drug concentration is above the MIC, such as with penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. Vancomycin activity is best predicted by the 24-hour area under the curve (AUC) over the MIC ratio, requiring both a certain peak level and sustaining of those levels for an extended period. This AUC:MIC ratio is a surrogate measure of the trough serum concentration of the medication. Traditionally, a trough level may be monitored before each dialysis session with dose adaptation made at the end of the same session, especially if postdialysis levels have been monitored already. Generally, experts recommend that dosage adjustments in renal replacement therapy be made either by adjusting the dosage being given or the dosing interval, depending on the therapeutic goal and relationships between drug concentration, clinical response, and toxicity. Although one may adjust either (dose given or interval between doses) in the inpatient setting, adjusting dose intervals for outpatient HD patients becomes impractical in many cases and could potentially put the patients at risk of ineffective therapy for periods of time. Knowing that dialytic clearance may be close to 50%, a pretreatment vancomycin level of 30 may decrease to 15, or just at the recommended minimum trough level, making it difficult to sustain blood levels within range without redosing after dialysis treatment. Also, for similar reasons of practicality, giving intravenous medications upon completion of intermittent HD treatments or after postdialysis vancomycin levels are obtained can prolong treatment times or lead to repeated cannulation. Adjusting the timing of antibiotic administration until after treatment was completed would lead to increased drug levels, as vancomycin has been shown to have 13% to 50% of the dose eliminated when administered over the last hour of HD. Adjustments to the timing of drug administration (during a possible treatment window) or to the dosing interval may be easier to consider with continuous renal replacement therapy when the patient and intravenous access is available over a longer period of time. PREP Pearls  In renal failure (both acute and chronic), there are alterations in not just drug elimination but potentially also with drug absorption, distribution, and metabolism that can affect its pharmacokinetics.  Drugs that have greater water solubility, less protein binding (<80%), lower Vd (<1 L/kg), and lower molecular weight (<1000 Daltons) are more easily dialyzed, in general.  The volume of distribution (Vd) is one of the primary considerations in determining the loading dose of intravenous medications so this may need to be taken into account for initial dosing.  Protein binding has significant influence on the capacity for dialytic clearance, both by diffusion and by convection.  The molecular size/weight of a drug is also important in determining whether they are better cleared by diffusive (ideal for <1000 Daltons) or convective (better for >1000 Daltons) therapies.

      "prematurity Answer E Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicates the course of 10% to 18% of pediatric patients in intensive care units and is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. One of the challenges in identifying the contributory risk factors for AKI has been the lack of a standard definition. Over the past few years, several standardized definitions of pediatric AKI have been developed, including pRIFLE, AKIN (a modified version of RIFLE), and KDIGO criteria. Similar criteria have been proposed for neonatal acute kidney injury, but these are still under investigation. Numerous studies have identified contributory risk factors for pediatric acute kidney injury. The most common causes of AKI are decreased perfusion, sepsis (contributing in about 50% of all cases), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, complex cardiac repair, and nephrotoxic medications (contributing in about 25% of all cases). Sepsis is the leading contributing factor to AKI in both neonatal and pediatric patients, with up to 40% of patients with sepsis developing AKI. Sepsis-induced AKI is particularly common in stem cell transplant recipients due to the marked immunosuppression of this group of patients. Sepsis induces tubular injury in part by decreasing renal blood flow, leading to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Abnormal intraglomerular pressures may also contribute to decreases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with dilation of the efferent arteriole in excess to dilation of the afferent arteriole. In addition to alterations in renal blood flow, decreased oxygen delivery in sepsis may contribute further to injury. Hypoxic injury induces oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and impairs nitric oxide synthase. Systemic cytokines, inflammation, and thrombosis in sepsis likely also contribute to injury. Changes in renal blood flow are not a factor; indeed, many cases of sepsis feature hyperdynamic renal blood flow. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is another risk factor for AKI; between 20% to 40% of children who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass will develop AKI. One study examined the risk of AKI after CPB. Young age, preoperative need for mechanical ventilation, gentamicin exposure, intraoperative use of milrinone and furosemide, duration of CPB and anesthesia, multiple cross-clamp, and transfusion of blood products were all significantly associated with AKI after CPB. Even in the absence of surgery, congenital heart abnormalities, including patent ductus arteriosus, likely contribute to tubular hypoxic injury. Prematurity is a major risk factor for AKI. Premature neonates are frequently exposed to and are more vulnerable to nephrotoxic medications and often develop systemic infections. Neonatal AKI is likely to be underrecognized, as nephrotoxic AKI may be polyuric, not oliguric. Moreover, detecting AKI in neonates can be confounded by the lack of reliability of diagnosis on the serum creatinine level due to developmental changes and their low body mass. Some reports have suggested that neonatal rates of AKI are highest of all age groups. Premature neonates are likely at a higher risk of AKI, in part due to developmental changes in regulation of glomerular filtration. For example, premature neonates have an impaired ability to autoregulate renal blood flow over changes in systemic blood pressure. Thus, smaller changes in blood pressure will be more likely to decrease renal blood flow in neonates. In addition, premature neonates have lower blood flow at baseline and therefore may be at higher risk for AKI with hemodynamic instability. Hypoxic injury is one of the top causes of AKI in term neonates. Up to 66% of neonates with severe asphyxia will develop renal dysfunction. Another study demonstrated that 55% of neonates with a 5 min Apgar score of less than 6 developed AKI. Premature neonates may be uniquely susceptible to AKI due to difficulty with adjusting medication doses to glomerular filtration rate. In addition, premature neonates exist in a relatively high renin-angiotensin state and rely upon prostaglandins for renal vasodilation to counteract the strong renin-angiotensin system. Thus, they are prone to be very susceptible to indomethacin-induced AKI. Dehydration and volume depletion contribute to risk for AKI in all children. Fluid therapy is the only intervention shown to have benefit in prevention of AKI. However, studies have failed to identify a superior benefit for any specific resuscitation fluid (colloid versus crystalloid). Similarly, vasopressors have not shown benefit to prevent AKI in adults, but they have been less well studied in children. Nephrotoxic medications and exposure to toxins (such as heme) are other risk factors for AKI in neonates and pediatric patients. Frequently, AKI is multifactorial. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugss, vancomycin, gentamicin, furosemide, and amphotericin are just a few of many commonly used nephrotoxins in pediatric intensive care unit patients. Rhabdomyolysis release of myoglobin and chemotherapy-induced tumor lysis with release of heme are additional risk factors for AKI. While the patent ductus arteriosus, young age, and furosemide and indomethacin exposure all likely contribute to increased risk of AKI in this neonate, the extreme prematurity likely contributes the greatest risk of AKI. PREP Pearls  Premature infants are more susceptible to acute kidney injury (AKI) due to impaired autoregulation and decreased renal blood flow  Sepsis, hypoxia, cardiopulmonary bypass, and nephrotoxic medications are leading causes of AKI in neonates and children.  Fluid therapy is the only treatment shown to have a benefit in preventing AKI.

      "magnesium level Answer A The patient in the vignette presents with classic signs of rickets, associated with hypophosphatemia with normocalcemia and hypercalciuria. The presentation is suspicious for hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH), a rare disorder of phosphate handling in the kidney. A diagnostic approach to rickets and hypophosphatemia is shown in the Figure. Phosphate is a major intracellular anion, and a key component of DNA, amino acids, and membrane lipids. Approximately 85% of phosphate in the adult is in the bones, 14% is in soft tissues, and 1% is in the extracellular fluid. In the normal adult, 60% of ingested phosphate is absorbed and balance is maintained by excretion in the urine. Phosphate is freely filtered and approximately 70% will be reabsorbed via sodium phosphate cotransporters in the proximal tubule. There are 3 types of sodium phosphate co-transporters: NaPi2a (SLC34A1, Npt2a, NaPi-IIa), NaPi2b (SLC34A2,Npt2b, NaPi-IIb), and NaPi2c (SLC34A3, Npt2c, NaPi-IIc). NaPi2b is also expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and is responsible for phosphate absorption. Its activity is regulated by 1,25 vitamin D, acidosis, and dietary phosphate. NaPi2a and 2c are expressed in the proximal renal tubule brush border. Both NaPi2a and 2c are regulated by dietary phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and the phosphoturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). NaPi2c plays the dominant role in phosphate absorption in humans. The contribution of NaPi2a is controversial; its mutations have been linked to autosomal recessive Fanconi syndrome and phosphaturia. Hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by large deletions or missense mutations in the gene encoding the NaPi2c co-transporter. Affected patients have massive phosphaturia; hypophosphatemia stimulates 1,25 hydroxylase to increase synthesis of 1,25 vitamin D, which causes suppression of PTH. Patients present with short stature, bone pain, muscle weakness, rickets, and deformities of the lower extremities. Hypercalciuria leads to increased risk of nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. Investigations reveal hypophosphatemia associated with hyperphosphaturia and hypercalciuria. Treatment is with phosphate supplements. Patients with HHRH must be distinguished from other causes of hypophosphatemia. 1,25 vitamin D levels are a useful measure to distinguish HHRH from other causes of hypophosphatemia. Nutritional rickets is caused by 25-vitamin D deficiency. It is more common in exclusively breastfed infants, and would typically present with hypophosphatemia with or without low serum calcium, depending on the severity and the duration of vitamin D deficiency. Such patients have low 25-vitamin D, normal-high 1,25 vitamin D, and normal to elevated PTH levels. X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH), autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR), and autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) are all caused by an excess FGF23 level. The most common inherited cause of rickets, XLH is caused by loss of function mutations in the PHEX (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X-chromosome) gene. Loss of PHEX function leads to elevated FGF23 levels. Elevated FGF23 leads to phosphaturia and suppressed 1,25 vitamin D and PTH levels. Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets is caused by mutations in FGF23 resulting in resistance to its degradation. A mutation that activated the FGF23 coreceptor Klotho has also been reported. Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) that lead to increased FGF23 levels. Recently, mutations in ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase1 (ENPP1) have also been linked to ARHR. Osteoglophonic dysplasia (OGD) is another rare autosomal dominant disorder due to an activating mutation of FGFR1. Osteoglophonic dysplasia is associated with craniofacial abnormalities. All lead to increased FGF23 or FGF23 receptor activity, which induces phosphaturia and inappropriately suppresses 1,25 vitamin D. McCune-Albright syndrome is caused by activating mutations in alpha subunit of stimulatory G protein (Gs α). It is a multi-endocrine disorder that presents with fibrous bone lesions, café-au-lait spots, precocious puberty, thyrotoxicosis, and Cushing syndrome. The bone lesions can lead to increased FGF23 secretion, phosphaturia, and suppressed 1,25 vitamin D. There are other causes of hypophosphatemia that are unlikely to present with rickets. Hyperparathyrodism, which may be a component of multiple endocrine neoplasias (MENs), will induce hypophosphatemia with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. 1,25 vitamin D in such patients will be suppressed. In addition to renal losses of phosphate, hypophosphatemia can result from severe malnutrition or poor gastrointestinal absorption, as with chronic diarrhea. Hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis can induce acute shifts of phosphate to the intracellular compartment, resulting in acute hypophosphatemia. In such cases, the urinary excretion of phosphorus will be low and “tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP)” can be calculated and will be very high, closer to 100%. PREP Pearls  Elevated 1,25 vitamin D distinguishes hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) from other causes of hypophosphatemia.  HHRH leads to risk of nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis  HHRH is due to loss of function of NaPi2c cotransporters American Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)  Know the clinical and laboratory evaluation of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria Suggested Readings  Bastepe M, Jüppner H.

However, in the absence of these conditions, an increased concentration of AFP suggests a prenatal diagnosis of the “Finnish Type” of congenital nephrotic syndrome. Pregnancies associated with unexplained high maternal serum AFP levels should be monitored closely. A management strategy based on ultrasound examination, second maternal serum AFP assay, and amniocentesis should be offered to improve prenatal counseling and management of such pregnancies. Retrospective establishment of fetal NPHS1 genotyping in 21 pregnancies that were terminated because of raised concentrations of AFP in the amniotic fluid showed that 12 fetuses were homozygous and 9 were heterozygous (carriers) for NPHS1 mutations. Raised concentrations of AFP and similar proteinuric features in fetal kidneys were seen in both groups, indicating that these signs are not reliable for prenatal diagnosis of congenital nephrotic syndrome. While AFP may be suggestive of congenital nephrotic syndrome, it is not definitive and mutation analysis of the NPHS1 gene should be done to confirm the AFP results in the prenatal diagnosis of congenital nephrotic syndrome. The term congenital nephrotic syndrome refers to a disease that is present at birth or within the first 3 months of life. Later onset of nephrotic syndrome between 3 months and 1 year of age is called infantile nephrotic syndrome. This time period distinction is somewhat semantic and archaic, as the causes overlap. Most of these children have a genetic basis for the renal disease and have a poor renal prognosis. The causes of congenital and infantile nephrotic syndrome are largely due to genetic mutations (more commonly in congenital versus infantile) in 4 genes: 1. NPHS1, which encodes nephrin (a key component of the podocyte slit diaphragm) and is responsible for the autosomal recessive “Finnish-Type” congenital nephrotic syndrome 2. NPHS2, which encodes podocin (a protein that interacts with nephrin at the slit diaphragm) and is responsible for autosomal recessive familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 3. WT1, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor (a protein involved in kidney and gonadal development) and is responsible for the Denys-Drash syndrome 4) LAMB2, which encodes laminin β2 (a component of the glomerular basement membrane) and is responsible for Pierson syndrome, featured by congenital nephrotic syndrome and ocular anomalies NPHS2 and NPHS1 occur most commonly and account for approximately 95% of cases. These patients do not respond to glucocorticoid therapy. In addition to these genes, mutations in the PLCE1 gene, which encodes phospholipase C epsilon, are responsible for early onset isolated diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS). Minimal change disease (MCD) does occur in the first year of life, but is unusual. Nongenetic causes of nephrotic syndrome in the first year of life are often secondary. These include infections such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis (rarely cytomegalovirus, HIV, hepatitis B, congenital rubella) and heavy metal exposure such as mercury. Laboratory evaluation of an infant with nephrotic syndrome includes blood work to evaluate hematological and renal function (Table 1). The blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations may initially be normal, although infants with diffuse mesangial sclerosis often present early with end stage or rapid progression to end stage disease. However, apart from diffuse mesangial sclerosis, the majority of infants with congenital nephrotic syndrome develop end stage renal disease between 3 and 8 years of age. Serum lipid levels may be markedly elevated and should be evaluated in all infants with early onset nephrotic syndrome. Urinalysis is significant for proteinuria, there is often microscopic hematuria, and occasionally there is sterile pyuria. Proteinuria is usually massive with NPHS1 mutations. Thyroid function and bone mineral metabolism should be assessed in all cases of infantile nephrotic syndrome. When infection or heavy metal exposure is suspected, appropriate laboratory evaluation is indicated. Genetic studies should be sent as there are diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic and genetic counselling implications (Table 2). As noted, the majority of infants with early onset nephrotic syndrome have mutations in NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1, or LAMB2. In patients with Finnish type congenital nephrotic syndrome who undergo renal biopsy, light microscopic study specimens show mild mesangial hypercellularity and increased mesangial matrix in the glomeruli early in the course. Over time, the increase in mesangial matrix is accompanied by progressive glomerulosclerosis. There are no immune deposits on immunofluorescent studies. Tubulointerstitial changes include irregular microcystic dilatation of proximal tubules, a feature that may be striking, but is not specific to the condition and is not present in all patients. There is a progressive interstitial fibrosis with lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration, tubular atrophy, and periglomerular fibrosis. This develops in parallel with sclerosis of the glomeruli. Pathology from infants with diffuse mesangial sclerosis demonstrates a fibrillar increase in the mesangial matrix with the deepest glomeruli least affected. There is absence of mesangial cell proliferation, but there is mesangial cell hypertrophy. The capillary walls are lined by hypertrophied podocytes that are prominent, but crescents are unusual. There is thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. The mesangium goes on to eventual sclerosis with obliteration of the capillary loops. On immunofluorescence, there is nonspecific and nondiagnostic trapping of immunoglobulin M and C3 deposits in the mesangium and at the periphery of the sclerotic glomeruli. On electron microscopy, there are mesangial fibrils. The glomerular basement membrane is split and undulating because of zones of subepithelial lucent widening. The renal biopsy in congenital syphilis shows a membranous nephropathy with mesangial proliferation. The pathology resolves with penicillin treatment. In congenital toxoplasmosis, there is mesangial proliferation with or without areas of focal sclerosis. Proteinuria, neurological, and ocular involvement resolves with steroid therapy. Inhibin A and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are hormones released by the placenta. Unconjugated estriol is a form of estrogen that is produced in the fetus and placenta. Low levels of AFP and estriol and high levels of hCG and inhibin A may suggest Down syndrome (trisomy 21) or Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18). Most of the biological effects of estrogens are mediated via the estrogen receptors at the level of gene regulation. The physiological effects of estrogen are manifested through 2 isoforms, estrogen receptor α and estrogen receptor β, but these are not relevant to nephrotic syndrome.

      "proton pump Answer C The infant in the vignette has biochemical features of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, proteinuria, and glycosuria in the absence of hyperglycemia. These features are suggestive of renal Fanconi syndrome (RFS), which is a disorder characterized by generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubule. In fact, the earliest description of such a case by the Swiss pediatrician Guido Fanconi consisted of proteinuria, glycosuria, and hypophosphatemia with rickets. The proximal tubule (PT) serves as the major workhorse of the nephron and is where the majority of the glomerular filtrate is reabsorbed. In addition, it is the sole site of reabsorption of solutes such as amino and organic acids, filtered proteins, glucose, and phosphate. In general, perturbations of PT transport function may be due to reduced cellular energy (affecting ATPase function), reduced permeability of substances across the luminal or basolateral membranes, functional changes in carrier proteins, and dysfunctional receptors or endocytosis. The transport tasks of the PT are accomplished by 2 major mechanisms: megalin and cubulin (MC) endocytosis and the Na gradient-dependent transport. Megalin and cubulin are multiligand tandem receptors expressed at the brush border of the PT. As elucidated by Marshansky et al and Brown et al, MC are required for the reabsorption, destruction, and recycling of proteins such as albumin, low molecular weight proteins, vitamin binding proteins, as well as polybasic drugs such as aminoglycosides. These proteins bind to MC and are subsequently endocytosed into the PT lumen via the endosome, where the receptor is separated from the ligand and recycled back to the brush border. The reabsorbed protein then goes to the lysosome for further processing (Figure 1). This separation is dependent on the H+- ATPase and ClC-5 (CLCN5) chloride channel. Perturbation of the MC pathway can be seen in chloride channel defects such as Dent disease and Lowe syndrome. Reabsorption of solutes such as glucose, amino acids, and phosphate is accomplished in tandem with Na via a Na-dependent transport mechanism, driven by the basolateral Na-K-ATPase pump with energy provided by mitochondria (Figure 2). The electrochemical gradient generated by pumping more Na out of the cell allows Na–coupled solute entry into the PT cell. Disorders that impair energy production interfere with transport proteins as well as the Na-K-ATPase, leading to the multiple transport dysfunctions that define RFS. Biochemical abnormalities seen in RFS are depicted in Table 1. The most common hereditary etiology of RFS is cystinosis. Other etiologies of RFS can be hereditary or acquired, as depicted in Table 2 and Table 3. In the vignette, the infant’s condition is most likely caused by disruption in the lysosomal transporter protein, resulting in RFS, as can be seen in cystinosis. Defects in the anion exchanger in the intercalated cells or the proton pump will lead to distal renal tubular disorders, not PT disorders. Mineralocorticoid receptor defects cause type 4 renal tubular acidosis with hyperkalemia. Finally, defective carbonic anhydrase II, as seen in acetazolamide administration, leads to isolated proximal tubular acidosis, not RFS.

    "explanation": "D. renal vein thrombosis\nThe neonate in this vignette has renal vein thrombosis. Renal vein thrombosis occurs as the most common de novo\nform of thrombosis in the newborn, accounting for approximately 10% of all venous thrombosis in the newborn.\nPerinatal risk factors associated with renal vein thrombosis include asphyxia, prematurity, maternal diabetes,\nintravascular volume depletion, sepsis, polycythemia, cyanotic congenital heart disease, and inherited prothrombotic\nconditions. The prothrombotic conditions occur in about 40% to 50% of cases and may be evaluated in newborns\npresenting with unexplained renal vein thrombosis. Workup of the prothrombotic condition may include looking for\nfactor V Leiden mutation, methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation, protein C and S deficiency,\nantithrombin III deficiency, prothrombin deficiency, and elevation of lipoprotein.\nThe proposed mechanisms that result in renal vein thrombosis include reduced renal blood flow, hyperosmolality and\nhypercoagulability, and increased blood viscosity. Renal vein thrombosis typically presents with the cardinal features\nof flank mass, gross hematuria, and thrombocytopenia. It can occur as an extension of inferior vena cava thrombosis\nor renal venous thrombosis may extend into larger vessels. However, in 1 series of 23 cases of which 83% were\ndiagnosed in the neonatal period, the complete triad was seen in only 13%. A systematic review of the literature from\n1992 to 2006 identified 271 patients from 13 case series. The time of presentation varied, with about 66% occurring\nby 3 days of life and a further 25% by 1 month of age. Less than 10% of renal vein thrombosis occurs as an in utero\nevent. Most affected neonates are born full term and are male. As stated previously, not all have all 3 cardinal\nfeatures, with gross hematuria present in 56%, thrombocytopenia present in 48%, and/or a palpable abdominal mass\nin 45%. The left kidney is involved in 66%, and in just under 50% of those, the thrombus extends into the inferior\nvena cava.\nNeonates who present with renal vein thrombosis have significant mortality and morbidity. Mortality occurs in\nassociation with coexisting medical conditions. Morbidity is significant and long term monitoring is required, as up to\n20% have hypertension, and almost 75% have evidence of chronic renal damage, of which some will need renal\nreplacement therapy.\nUltrasonography is usually used to diagnose renal vein thrombosis in the neonate. Early findings in the antenatal\nperiod include an enlarged kidney with an echogenic cortex with prominent and less echogenic medullary pyramids.\nEchogenic streaks may be noted in peripheral focal segments of the affected kidney. Color Doppler ultrasonography\nshows absent intrarenal and renal venous flow. Thereafter, the kidney appearance becomes increasingly\nheterogeneous with loss of corticomedullary differentiation. The kidneys may show subsequent atrophy with focal\nscarring; ultrasonography can be used to follow and predict outcome for the affected kidneys. Supportive treatment at\nthe time of diagnosis includes correction of fluid and electrolyte disturbances and treatment of the underlying\ncondition. If there is evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, unfractionated heparin or low molecular\nweight heparin can be used. Conventional anticoagulants reduce hypercoagulability and may reduce the risk for\nthrombus progression and embolism. Surgery may be attempted if there is bilateral renal involvement with\ninvolvement of the inferior vena cava. Hypertension may require treatment.\nHydronephrosis of the newborn may be due to obstruction at the level of the ureter and bladder. The hydronephrosis\nmay be unilateral or bilateral. While maternal ultrasonography screening is commonly performed, most cases of\nobstruction are diagnosed because of postnatal evaluation of antenatal hydronephrosis. There are criteria for the\ndiagnosis and grading of antenatal hydronephrosis based upon the degree of pelvic dilatation, number of calyces seen,\nand the presence and severity of parenchymal atrophy. When there has been no antenatal screening, newborns may\n\npresent with a palpable flank mass caused by an enlarged obstructed kidney. Other presentations include urinary tract\ninfection and hematuria. A 2-day-old newborn is unlikely to present with gross hematuria secondary to a urinary tract\ninfection. Renal insufficiency occurs in newborns with a single obstructed kidney or with bilateral involvement.\nPyelonephritis of the newborn is most common in the setting of sepsis with systemic spread from blood, but can also\noccur with obstruction of the urinary tract. The signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection in neonates are\nnonspecific. Newborns can have lethargy, irritability, tachypnea, or cyanosis, and may appear acutely ill with unstable\nvital signs such as hypotension and hypothermia.\nWilms tumor can rarely present in the newborn period as an incidental mass. The neonatal symptoms are vague and\nnonspecific. There are a few reported cases of prenatal detection with postnatal confirmation of Wilms tumor. All\ndescribed neonatal cases were unilateral and none occurred in relation to a syndrome. Wilms tumor is primarily a\nsporadic disease, may occur as part of a multiple malformation syndrome, and it is rarely familial. Syndromes\nassociated with increased risk of Wilms tumor include Wilms tumor-aniridia-growth retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash,\nand Beckwith-Wiedemann. Most children with Wilms tumor present with an isolated abdominal mass or swelling.\nHowever, abdominal pain is present in up to one-third of children and hematuria, fever, and hypertension in up to\none-fourth. On physical examination there is a firm, nontender, smooth eccentrically located flank mass that rarely\ncrosses the midline.\nAdrenal hemorrhage occurs in about 15% of neonates who have renal vein thrombosis. However, adrenal hemorrhage\nas such does not present as a flank mass.\nPREP Pearls\n Renal vein thrombosis occurs as the most common de novo form of thrombosis in the newborn\n Pprothrombotic conditions occur in about 40-50 percent of cases\n Morbidity is significant and long-term monitoring is required\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the various etiologies of renal vein thrombosis in the neonate\nSuggested Readings\n Kraft JK, Brandão LR, Navarro OM.

It complements, expands,\nand often clarifies findings made on light and immunofluorescent microscopy. Electron microscopy (EM) has the ability\nto detect most forms of glomerular disease and dysfunction, and the ability to examine small, suboptimal, or unusual\nspecimens. The shortcomings of EM include an inability to detect disorders without specific ultrastructural signature,\nan inability to distinguish biochemical heterogeneity of deposits with similar or identical ultrastructural appearances,\nand occasional false-negative results in diseases with focal manifestations. Electron microscopy requires particular\nfixation and handling of the material. It is therefore time-consuming and not universally available. When EM is\nthought to be required at the time of a biopsy (eg, for Alport disease or thin basement disease), a portion of the\nmaterial should be fixed with glutaraldehyde. Alternatively, formalin-fixed tissue can be used subsequently for EM.

However, even in this latter example, it is still recommended to\nconsult those with adult vascular access expertise to either supervise or to place better permanent access (ie, AVG or\nAVF).\nAlthough there is a dearth of reports on outcomes with AVF or AVG in children, the limited number of studies report\ncomplication rates and outcomes similar to those of adult studies. Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of\neach access type in older children and adolescents seem to be similar to that of adults.\nLike in adults, AVF is considered the best option in patients who are able to have one placed. The advantage of AVF\nover both AVG and CVC is a lower incidence of complications, including infection, stenosis, and needed interventions.\nThe infection rates of CVC in children have been reported as 60 times greater than that of AVF, while the infection\nrates of AVG have ranged from 4 to 10 times greater than AVF. In the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns\n(DOPPS) study in adults, AVG were 3 times more likely to require interventions than AVF, while almost 4 times more\nlikely to require thrombectomy. Similarly, a larger case series in children showed AVG to have twice the number of\ncomplications and interventions as AVF. With these lower number of complications, AVF have been shown to have\nimproved longevity with secondary patency rates of 60% to 70% after 3 or 4 years, compared to rates of 40% in\nAVG.\nHowever, AVF have a few disadvantages compared to AVG, which must also be considered. As it takes time for the\nvenous side to dilate after anastomosis of the artery, there is a longer maturation time with AVF compared to AVG. In\nadults, this time to maturation may take 6 weeks, however, this may be even longer in younger children, with periods\nlasting up to 4 months being considered standard. While the AVF is fully maturing, there may be lower blood flow\nrates initially, however, there should be improved blood flow rates over time. The greatest disadvantage of AVF\ncompared to AVG is the primary failure rate, or inability to initially use the access. This typically occurs because of a\nlack of maturation of the AVF, but may also occur from thrombosis. This rate has been reported as high as 33% in\nsome pediatric series and contributes to the large numbers of failed AVF overall. A lower primary failure rate has been\nreported in some larger pediatric series from Europe, as low as 10%, and has been attributed to the use of\nmicrosurgical techniques, but is also very dependent on overall surgical expertise. Appropriate screening of patients\nfor AVF placement has led to improved rates of both AVF placement with lower rates of primary failure in adult\npatients. Preoperative venous mapping to determine vessel (both artery and vein) caliber and position allow for\nappropriate patient selection for AVF. Venous diameters that are less than 2.0 mm and radial artery diameters less\nthan 1.6 mm are associated with higher primary failure rates in adults. Additionally, the knowledge of collateral veins\ndraining about the fistula would allow for venous ligation at the time of or shortly following AVF placement to limit the\nrisk of poor maturation.\nArteriovenous grafts are considered acceptable alternatives for long term access in patients in which they are more\nappropriate. In addition to having a shorter maturation time, which is typically 2 weeks but may be as brief as 1\n\nweek, the distinct advantages of AVG are a higher primary patency rate and the ability to place in patients with\nsmaller vessels. Primary patency rate of AVG in children has been reported as high as 96%, which is considerably\nhigher than the 67% to 80% reported for AVF. Also, with the use of polytetrafluoroethylene as graft material, newer\ngrafts may be adjusted somewhat to fit individual patient anatomy. Smaller diameter grafts are available and may be\ntapered to fit smaller vessels. Additionally, with longer grafts, there is the option of creating a loop AVG in the forearm\nin larger children, which gives the possibility of a larger surface area for needle cannulation than may develop in AVF.\nHowever, straight AVG are still frequently used in younger children and may not provide more surface area of\ncannulation. Other anecdotal reports say AVG may be technically easier to cannulate as well.\nThe disadvantages of AVG are the higher complication rates compared to AVF, but these complication rates are still\nlower than CVC, explaining why they are considered acceptable but not optimal access. Arteriovenous grafts do have\nhigher rates of pseudoaneurysm formation than AVF, which can be caused by repetitive or imprecise cannulation in\nthe same areas of the graft. Similarly, AVG have higher rates of stenosis, which typically occurs at the venous\nanastomosis site, and subsequently have higher rates of thrombosis as a consequence of impaired flow from the\nstenosis.\nArteriovenous fistula and AVG together have been shown to have higher clearance rates (Kt/V and urea reduction rate\n[URR]), hemoglobin, and albumin levels when compared to CVC in children receiving HD. The improved hemoglobin\nand albumin levels are thought to be secondary to decreased inflammation compared to using a CVC. However, there\nwas no distinction that AVG had significantly higher Kt/V or URR compared to AVF, including in adult studies to date,\neven though they may generate higher blood flows. One distinct disadvantage of AVG (compared to AVF) is the need\nto maintain higher blood flow rates to maintain patency, likely because of higher stenosis rates. It is recommended\nthat both AVF and AVG be routinely monitored for decreases in blood flow as an indicator of stenosis and, ultimately,\na predictor of thrombosis. It is recommended that further evaluation be performed in an AVG when blood flow rates\nare less than 600 to 700 mL/min, while the threshold for AVF is less than 400 to 500 mL/min, such that AVG do not\ntolerate lower blood flow rates as well. In smaller children (<35 kg), these tolerated blood flow rates may need to be\nnormalized to the patient’s body surface area.\nCentral venous catheters are still the most common long term HD access for children in the United States, even\nthough they have the highest complication rates. There are some technical and logistical concerns in pediatric patients\nthat may favor this access in this population. Infants and smaller children (< 20 kg) will have particularly small\nvessels that do not allow for them to be candidates for AVG or AVF placement. Developmental or behavioral issues in\nsome children may not allow for needle cannulation of an AVG or AVF, while parental concern over regular needle use\nin their ill child may also pose a challenge. Lastly, the acuity in which many pediatric patients present with end stage\nrenal disease may not allow for preemptive planning of long term HD access.\nThe disadvantages of long term CVC use are well documented, with the greatest risks being infection and access\nmalfunction. The most common complication with CVC use in children is infection, with reported bacteremia rates\nranging from 1.5 to 4.8 infections per 1,000 patient days. Some of this increased risk with CVC use is because of the\npermanent break in skin integrity created with percutaneous tunneled CVCs, as common skin flora are the more\ncommon causes of catheter-related bacteremia in HD patients. However, there is the added risk of bacterial seeding\nwith the permanent presence of CVC within the blood stream.\nAccess malfunction with CVC can be secondary to thrombosis, like with AVF or AVG, but may also be caused by\ncatheter tip malposition, fibrin sheath accumulation, or infection. Central venous catheter secondary patency rates at\n1 year have been reported as low as 10% to 27% in some studies, with average access survival being measured often\n\nin months, not years. Additionally, the placement of CVC can cause central venous stenosis, which may prohibit future\nuse of those vessels for placement of either temporary or more permanent vascular access.\nPREP Pearls\n Arteriovenous (AV) fistulae are the preferred access for long term hemodialysis in children. Their advantages\nover both AV grafts and central venous catheters include lower incidences of infection, stenosis, vascular\nsteal, overall complications, and needed interventions. However, their distinct disadvantages are a higher\nprimary failure rate (up to 30% in some reports) and longer maturation times, especially in younger children\n Arteriovenous grafts for long term hemodialysis access are preferred over catheters because of improved\nrates of patency, infection, and overall clearance. In addition to shorter maturation times and lower primary\nfailure rates, grafts may also offer a larger surface area for cannulation, as well as being easier to cannulate in\ngeneral\n When planning for hemodialysis access, individual patient factors to be considered include expected length of\ntime that access will be needed, patient size, and vessel size in the preferred extremity\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the principles, advantages, and disadvantages of the different types of vascular access for hemodialysis\nin infants, children and adolescents\nSuggested Readings\n Cass DL, Nuchtern JG.

    "explanation": "A. serum calcium\nThe case in the vignette is the typical phenotype of a patient with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS).\nWilliams-Beuren syndrome affects 1:7,500 to 20,000 children. It is caused by homozygous deletion of chromosome\n7q11.23. This region includes 28 genes, including ELN, LIMK1, and RFC2. Deletions in the WBS region arise due to\nhigh similarity of locus control regions, as a consequence of misalignment of gametes during meiosis and unequal\ncrossing over. Seventy-five percent of patients with WBS have cardiac involvement, most often with supravalvular\naortic stenosis (SVAS). ELN encodes elastin, which likely contributes to the aortic manifestations; this is distinct from\nfamilial SVAS, in which disruption of the ELN gene alone causes SVAS with a scarcity of the other features of WBS.\nElastin deficiency may also affect arterial stiffness. Studies examining arterial stiffness using pulse wave velocity have\nidentified increased arterial stiffness in WBS patients, both with and without hypertension. There is an increased risk\nof sudden cardiac death from cardiac disease in WBS patients.\nWilliams-Beuren syndrome is associated with weakness of connective tissue, resulting in a typical facies. The typical\nWilliams-Beuren “elfin” facies features a wide mouth, sunken nasal bridge, full cheeks and full lips, delicate chin,\nperiorbital fullness, long philtrum, and a broad forehead (figure). The facies may be subtle to recognition at birth.\nOlder patients may exhibit more coarse facial features. Patients will have short stature.\nWilliams-Beuren syndrome is associated with neurocognitive changes, and patients have difficulty with tasks requiring\ncomplex visual analysis for receiving information. Williams-Beuren syndrome patients perform better with tasks\ninvolving both an auditory input and verbal output. Williams-Beuren syndrome patients are friendly with a “cocktail\npersonality” and high sociability, with reasonably preserved facial recognition, though later in life, some patients\ndevelop anxiety, obsessions, attention deficit disorder, and other psychosocial difficulties. IQ is variable (normal to\nseverely impaired). Many patients are challenged with living skills and have impaired motor abilities. Patients may\nalso have musculoskeletal issues, including hypertonia, dental problems (malocclusion), scoliosis or kyphosis, and\njoint limitations.\nHypertension is a frequent complication of WBS, affecting approximately 50% of patients. Renal artery stenosis was\nidentified in 58% of patients in one study; 9% had aortic coarctation. According to a study by Pankau et al in 1996,\nthe incidence of renal anomalies in WBS is 17.7% (versus 1.5% in the general population). The urinary tract\nanomalies seen in their series included bladder diverticula, renal aplasia, renal hypoplasia, and duplex kidney. Their\nfindings strongly support obtaining renal ultrasonography in patients with WBS.\nFifteen percent of infants may present with hypercalcemia, and WBS was initially described as “idiopathic infantile\nhypercalcemia with failure to thrive.” If measured, hypercalcemia is present in 40% of patients. The hypercalcemia\ntends to be transient, is most commonly diagnosed in infancy, and resolves by 4 years of age. While the\nhypercalcemia is usually mild (up to about 11.5 mg/dL), it can be more severe. Hypercalciuria may occur alone or in\nconjunction with hypercalcemia, and uncommonly patients with WBS may develop nephrocalcinosis. It is\nrecommended to screen patients with WBS for hypercalcemia by measuring serum calcium levels, for hypercalciuria\nby measuring the urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio, and to obtain a renal ultrasonography in the neonatal period or\nat the time of diagnosis. The mechanism of hypercalcemia is unclear, and 1,25 vitamin D and parathyroid hormone\nlevels have been reported to be variable. None of the genes within the deleted region have been linked to metabolism,\n\nbut the calcitonin receptor gene is just outside the deleted region. Interestingly, reduced bone mineral density is not\nuncommon in adults with WBS who had normal serum calcium levels during adulthood.\nOther abnormalities seen in WBS include impaired glucose tolerance, with some developing diabetes mellitus,\npotentially complicated by obesity and mild hypothyroidism.\nFor the child in the vignette, there is no evidence for renal dysfunction or thyroid imbalance. Thus, with clinical\nfindings of WBS, the next best test is to check a serum calcium level. Serum phosphorous levels are generally normal\nin WBS; therefore, obtaining a level is not mandatory at this time. However, if the calcium is abnormal, measuring\nserum parathyroid hormone and phosphorous levels would be justifiable.\nPREP Pearls\n Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is associated with supravalvular stenosis, hypercalcemia, and\nnephrocalcinosis\n The facial features of a wide mouth, sunken nasal bridge, full cheeks and full lips, periorbital fullness, and a\nbroad forehead may be subtle and difficult to diagnosis at birth.\n Hypertension is common with WBS, both secondary to renal artery stenosis and aortic coarctation.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Recognize the renal and non-renal clinical manifestations of Williams syndrome\nSuggested Readings\n Bayés M, Magano LF, Rivera N, Flores R, Pérez Jurado LA.

    "explanation": "A. breastfeeding difficulties\nThe outpatient presentation of a less than 2-week-old newborn with hypernatremia is almost exclusively associated\nwith breastfeeding difficulties. In one series from the United Kingdom, hypernatremia (>150 mmol/L in this study but\ntypically defined in children as >145 mmol/L) occurred in the first 2 weeks of life in about 1:250 deliveries, and 97%\nof cases were associated with breastfeeding difficulties. Colostrum (0-fifth day) and transitional milk (sixth-tenth day)\ncontain relatively higher sodium concentrations (21 mEq/L and 23 mEq/L) than mature milk (7-8 mEq/L), but the\nmain problem is inadequate intake rather than the composition of the breast milk. Infants with inadequate intake of\nbreast milk may develop lethargy, high pitch cry, hyperbilirubinemia, slow weight gain, starvation, and hypernatremic\ndehydration.\nIn infants with breastfeeding difficulties and associated hypernatremia, the assessment is facilitated by knowing the\nbirth weight. Infants are expected to lose 5% to 7% of birth weight in the first week of life, but in cases of\nbreastfeeding-associated hypernatremia, weight loss is excessive. Further exacerbating the vulnerability of infants to\nexcess water loss is their relatively larger surface area in relation to their height and weight. In a large study out of\nIran, hypernatremic infants (> 150 mEq/L Na, age approximately 9 days) had a weight loss of 16.2%, compared to\n1.6% in healthy controls. For a 3.5 kg infant, a free water loss of 15% body weight with an initial sodium of 140\nmEq/L (140 mmol/L) would be expected to raise the serum sodium to well over 170 mEq/L (170 mmol/L). The usual\nequation to calculate the water deficit is:\nWater deficit (in L) = [(current Na level in mEq/L ÷ 140 mEq/L) - 1] x 0.7 x weight (in kg).\nThe 0.7 is the volume of distribution for water, which is higher (0.7-0.8) in infants than in children.\nOther signs and symptoms of hypernatremia in children include vomiting, weakness, muscular twitching, fever,\nirritability, altered mental status, coma, and seizures.\nOverall, the causes of hypernatremia in children may be divided into a net loss of free water or net gain of sodium\n(Table).\nNet Water Loss\nPure water\nUnreplaced insensible loses (dermal and respiratory)\nHypodipsia\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus\nPost-traumatic\nCaused by tumors, cysts, histiocytosis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis\nIdiopatic\nCaused by aneurysms, meningitis, encephalitis, Gullian-Barré\nsyndrome\nCaused by ethanol ingestion (transient)\nCongenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\nAcquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\nCaused by renal disease (e.g. medullary cystic disease)\nCaused by hypercalcemia or hypokalemia\nCaused by drugs (lithium, demeclocycline, foscarnet,\nmethoxyflurane, amphotericin B, vasopressin V2-receptor\n\nantagonists)\nHypotonic fluid\nRenal causes\nLoop diuretics\nOsmotic diuresis (glucose, urea, mannitol)\nPostobstructive diuresis\nPolyuric phase of acute tubular necrosis\nIntrinsic renal disease\nGastrointestinal causes\nVomiting\nNasogastric drainage\nEnterocutaneous fistula\nDiarrhea\nUse of osmotic cathartic agents (e.g., lactulose)\nCutaneous causes\nBurns\nExcessive sweating\nHypertonic Sodium Gain\nHypertonic sodium bicarbonate infusion\nHypertonic feeding preparation\nIngestion of sodium chloride\nIngestion of sea water\nSodium chloride-rich emetics\nHypertonic saline enemas\nIntrauterine injection of hypertonic saline\nHypertonic sodium chloride infusion\nHypertonic dialysis\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism\nCushing syndrome\nTable. Causes of hypernatremia. Reprinted with permission from Adrogué HJ, Madias NE. Hypernatremia. N Engl J Med.\n2000;342(20):1493-1499.\nIn the newborn, especially the preterm neonate, insensible water losses are higher than that seen in older children.\nFor example, insensible water loss in a 750 to 1,000 g premature infant may be 60 to 70 mL/kg per day. In addition,\nsick premature newborns often inadvertently receive a high sodium load (may be 2-5 mEq/kg per day) with therapy\n(sodium bicarbonate, ampicillin, piperacillin, ranitidine, blood transfusion, etc) in the first few days of life that exceeds\nthe developing kidney’s capacity to maintain homeostasis. In some case reports with mothers with mastitis, the\ninfants develop hypernatremia because of excess salt in the mother’s breast milk. In formula fed infants, incorrect\nformula preparation may lead to hypernatremia. Diarrhea, with water loss exceeding salt loss is an important cause of\nhypernatremia, especially in the developing world.\nA large series out of Scotland examining 42 children older than 2 weeks to 17 years of age with hypernatremia on\nadmission to hospital found that the most common causes were gastroenteritis and dehydration (n=21, 50%),\n\nsystemic infection and dehydration (n=13, 31%), short bowel and parental nutrition (n=3, 7%), and diabetes\ninsipidus (n=2, 4.5%); there were individual cases of diabetic ketoacidosis, salt poisoning, and breastfeeding\nassociated hypernatremia (> 2 weeks of age). Three of the 42 patients died.\nHypernatremia may also occur in children already hospitalized for other conditions. The incidence of hospital-acquired\nhypernatremia in children is about 1% and most commonly occurs in critically ill children who are receiving a deficit of\nadequate free water. In the series from Scotland cited previously, 32% (56/176) of patients who developed\nhypernatremia during a hospital admission died. The most common causes of hypernatremia in already hospitalized\npatients were systemic infection and dehydration (27%), postoperative heart surgery (22%), head injury and diabetes\ninsipidus (10%), and diabetes with diabetic ketoacidosis (9%).\nPREP Pearls\n In the first 2 weeks of age, the most common cause of hypernatremia is breast feeding associated difficulties.\n Above 2 weeks of age, gastroenteritis is the most common cause of hypernatremia.\n Acquired in hospital hypernatremia is associated with significant mortality.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the causes of hypernatremia\nSuggested Readings\n Adrogué HJ, Madias NE.

    "explanation": "D. HLA antigen matching is less important in transplantation than blood group antigen matching\nSeveral major advances in medicine that led to Nobel prizes were for work done in the field of transplantation. Among\nthese were experiments that led to delineation of how the immune system identifies self-antigens from foreign\nantigens. In both mice and humans, the system of antigens that are expressed on nucleated cells is called the major\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) system. In humans, as shown in Figure 1, the corresponding genes are coded for on\nchromosome 6 (not 16) and are called the MHC.\nIn humans, a synonym of MHC is human leucocyte antigen (HLA), though the antigens are expressed on other cells\nalso besides leukocytes.\nThe HLA system comprises of several genes (Figure 1), which encode for proteins that function as a complex when\nexpressed on antigen-presenting cells to present peptides to immune T cells for recognition of “safe” versus\n“dangerous” antigens. The HLA genes are subdivided as class I (HLA genes A, B, and C) and class II (DP, DQ, and\nDR). Further subclassifications of alleles have occurred, such that numbers are assigned to subtypes (eg, A1, B5,\nDQ7). Each human has 2 alleles on each HLA gene, with 1 allele derived from each parent. The set of A, B, C, and D\nantigens derived from 1 parent is known as the haplotype. Each biological parent is a 1 haplotype match to each of\ntheir children. As depicted in Figure 2, the class I and class II MHC complexes are similar but slightly different from\neach other.\n\nFigure 2. Major histocompatibility class I and class II structure.

Dharnidharka.\nAs shown in Figure 3, class I antigens present peptides to CD8 T cells and class II antigens present peptides to CD4 T\ncells (rule of 8 mnemonic: 1 x 8 = 8, 2 x 4 = 8).\n\nFigure 3.

The Role of T-Cell Costimulatory Activation Pathways in Transplant\nRejection. New Engl J Med. 338:1813-1821\nThis system was originally created as a defense mechanism to identify and attack foreign microbial organism peptides.\nWe now know that antigen presenting cells are actually presenting peptides to T cells on a constant basis, even\nantigens from the host’s own tissues, to maintain recognition of self. When a foreign organ is transplanted, peptides\nderived from the transplant organ proteins are presented to host or recipient T cells and are recognized as foreign,\nbased on different HLA alleles expressed in the donated organ. The T cells then intiate an attack upon the foreign\norgan and assist B cells to form antibodies directed against those antigens.\nIn kidney transplantation, the degree of HLA mismatch has directly impacted outcomes, such that higher degrees of\nmismatch are associated with worse long term allograft survival. For this purpose, the matching system looks at\nalleles on A, B, and D, but not C, which is a weak antigen. In general, the class II alleles on D (DP, DQ, and DR) are\nconsidered stronger antigens than class I alleles.\nWhile HLA alleles are the most important set of recognition antigens used by the immune system, they are by no\nmeans the exclusive antigens to which antibodies may form against. The host may form antibodies to many other\ndonor-derived antigens, such as those expressed on donor endothelium. In general, these endothelial antibodies are\nless important than HLA antibodies in terms of transplantation outcomes. However, in contrast, the ABO blood group\nantigen system is much more important than the HLA system for recipient immune system attack upon the\ntransplanted organ. Outside of early infancy, all humans have preformed antibodies to the antigens that their own\n\ncells do not express. Therefore, transplanting across incompatible blood groups can be associated with vigorous\nimmune system attack and hyperacute rejection, unless intense immunosuppression is provided.\nIn the vignette, the donor is a 2-antigen mismatch to the recipient. Note the use of the “2 mismatch” term rather than\n“3 match” because the donor expresses A7 at both alleles, which the recipient will not mount antibodies to, as the\nrecipient also expresses A7 at one of her own alleles. In this case, the recipient now has mounted donor-specific\nantibodies to both the mismatched antigens DQ8 and B5. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) is a gauge of the\nantibody strength, though it was not meant for that purpose and should be interpreted cautiously. In general, higher\nMFIs imply a higher strength of antibody response. Many laboratories use an MFI of 2,000 as a cutoff for positivity,\nthough results from the same sample vary by laboratory.\nIn the vignette, the light microscopy features, the immunofluorescence complement component 4d-positive staining,\nand presence of donor specific antibodies at sufficient MFI for DQ8 together are sufficient to meet criteria for\nantibody-mediated rejection.\nPREP Pearls\n The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of genes codes for proteins that are critical for immune system\nrecognition of self versus nonself\n Class I MHC complex presents peptides to CD8 T-cells, and class II MHC complex presents peptides to CD4 T-\ncells\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the structure, function, and genetics of class 1 and 2 major histocompatibility complex antigens\nSuggested Readings\n Duquesnoy RJ.

    "explanation": "B. enalapril\nThis patient has the finding of large echogenic kidneys with poor corticomedullary differentiation, typical of autosomal\nrecessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is caused by mutations in\nPKHD1, a large gene that encodes fibrocystin/polyductin. While less common, it should be noted that autosomal\ndominant PKD (ADPKD) can occasionally mimic ARPKD and present in neonates as bilateral enlarged echogenic\nkidneys without cysts. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease may also be diagnosed on prenatal\nultrasonography. For severely affected infants, there are high rates of mortality (30%-40%) in neonates with ARPKD\nafter birth due to pulmonary hypoplasia. While earlier onset of oligohydramnios and kidney size are associated with\nincreased mortality, there are no definitive measures that have been validated to predict mortality.\nTreatment of ARPKD is focused on potential complications. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease has both\nrenal and extra-renal manifestations. Especially in the first few years of life, enlarged ARPKD kidneys may impair\nrespiration or lead to difficulty with feeding. Respiratory compromise and feeding intolerance are potential indications\nfor nephrectomy, although this remains controversial. Some have suggested that rapid enlargement of the residual\nkidney may occur after unilateral nephrectomy, limiting the utility of this approach. In cases of bilateral nephrectomy,\na peritoneal dialysis catheter can be placed and allowed to heal while the patient undergoes hemodialysis for a brief\nperiod. However, caution must be applied in performing nephrectomies in newborns, as the underlying respiratory\ncompromise may be more related to pulmonary hypoplasia than renal size. Kidneys generally do not increase in size\nafter the first 2 to 3 years.\nOne of the most common manifestations of ARPKD is hypertension (HTN), which affects two thirds of patients. The\nHTN is likely caused by renin-angiotensin activation. Treatment with angiotensin inhibitors or angiotensin receptor\nblockers is recommended for blood pressure (BP) control. For the patient in the vignette who has hypertension,\ntherapy with enalapril to control BP and proteinuria is indicated. While the HTN may be severe in young patients, it\ntends to improve with age.\nProgressive renal dysfunction is another common complication of ARPKD, and more than 50% of patients with ARPKD\nwill progress to end stage renal disease in the first 10 years of life, requiring renal replacement therapy with dialysis\nand renal transplantation.\nA final renal complication of ARPKD patients is recurrent urinary tract infections, and in such patients, antibiotic\nprophylaxis may be useful.\nExtrarenal complications of ARPKD include abnormalities of biliary ductal plate and portal veins. There is a spectrum of\nbile duct abnormalities, from choledochal cysts to intrahepatic ductal dilatation. These bile duct abnormalities can\nresult in bile duct proliferation and expansion of portal areas characteristic of congenital hepatic fibrosis in\napproximately 30% of ARPKD patients. Portal hypertension affects 15% to 44% of patients with ARPKD. Screening of\nARPKD patients by abdominal ultrasonography for splenomegaly and intra- and extrahepatic biliary dilatation is\nrecommended. In addition to congenital hepatic fibrosis, 16% to 26% of patients with ARPKD may develop Caroli\ndisease (dilatation of large intrahepatic bile ducts).\nBiliary abnormalities can result in variceal hemorrhage, hypersplenism, and protein-losing enteropathy. Especially with\nCaroli disease, bile stasis may lead to risk for recurrent cholangitis in up to 65% of patients of ARPKD. These episodes\n\nof cholangitis can lead to life-threatening sepsis. Cholangitis and sepsis are the leading causes of death postrenal\ntransplant, and antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent cholangitis is recommended.\nThere are several approaches to address the biliary complications of ARPKD. Gastric varicoceles can be ligated\nendoscopically. Portal hypertension and recurrent variceal hemorrhages can be treated with portosystemic shunts.\nHowever, there is a high risk of hyperammonemia with portosystemic shunts in patients with decreased renal\nfunction. Liver transplant is considered for patients with recurrent bacterial cholangitis, Caroli disease, severe portal\nhypertension, and, less commonly, synthetic liver dysfuntion.\nProgression to end stage renal disease or end stage liver disease is variable, and some patients have lived to mid-\nadulthood. Thus, the role of liver and kidney transplant in treatment of ARPKD is patient-specific. Amongst the factors\nto consider regarding combined liver and kidney transplantation is the degree that each organ is involved. The\nadvantage of reduced immunologic risk in performing combined liver and kidney transplant from the same donor\nshould be considered in timing of transplants in patients with both organs affected.\nIn the vignette, the child has ARPKD had uncontrolled hypertension that would be best treated by inhibition of the\nrenin-angiotensin system. Children with ARPKD and chronic kidney failure may develop acidosis, growth failure, and\nhyperphosphatemia. While sodium bicarbonate, growth hormone, and calcium carbonate, respectively, may be\nrequired to treat these complications, there were no indications in the vignette that the patient requires therapy for\nthose conditions at this time, making enalapril the best current choice for treatment. Similarly, antibiotic prophylaxis\nmay be required if the patient develops recurrent cholangitis or urinary tract infections, but none of these\ncomplications are evident at this time.\nPREP Pearls\n Screening for congenital hepatic fibrosis should be performed in children with autosomal recessive polycystic\nkidney disease (ARPKD).\n Renin mediated hypertension is common in ARPKD\n Mortality from pulmonary hypoplasia is high after birth, but there are no definitive prenatal predictors of\nmortality\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the treatment of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease including management of complications\nin the neonatal period\nSuggested Readings\n Büscher R, Büscher AK, Weber S, et al.

      "pre-renal azotemia Answer: C The patient in this vignette has the typical clinical features that place her at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI). The blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine are only mildly elevated. However, the urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) level is extremely high, indicative of structural injury to the kidney tubules and allowing for the early prediction of intrinsic AKI. A progressive increase in serum creatinine (typically 1-2 mg/dL per day) is the hallmark of intrinsic AKI, and has served as a biomarker of AKI for several decades. However, serum creatinine concentration is a flawed AKI biomarker for several reasons. Serum creatinine merely provides a retrospective diagnosis of AKI, well after the damage is done, and is not a prospective prediction. Serum creatinine does not differentiate the nature, type, and timing of the renal insult. Changes in serum creatinine concentrations often lag behind changes in glomerular filtration rate until a steady state has been reached, which can take several days. Even normal serum creatinine can vary widely with age, gender, diet, muscle mass, nutrition status, medications, and hydration status. Generally, more than 50% of kidney function must be lost before the serum creatinine even begins to rise. The use of cystatin C as an alternative endogenous marker of kidney function in children is now well established. Cystatin C is a ubiquitous cysteine protease inhibitor protein that is produced by all nucleated cells at a constant rate, freely filtered by the glomerulus, and catabolized by the proximal tubule. Its measurement is simple, standardized on a clinical platform, and widely available. Plasma concentration of cystatin C is not affected by gender, diet, hydration, muscle mass, and age (cystatin C levels are nearly identical in adults and children older than 12 months of age). Cystatin C outperforms serum creatinine for estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in adults and children. Several recent studies have demonstrated that plasma cystatin C is an earlier predictive biomarker of AKI in children and adults than serum creatinine. A recent meta-analysis has revealed the potential usefulness of cystatin C for the prediction of AKI. However, plasma cystatin C levels are elevated by steroids and other immunosuppressive therapies, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, and acute inflammatory states, and may falsely reflect a lower GFR in these clinical situations. Furthermore, in temporally predictable forms of AKI (such as cardiac surgery or nephrotoxin use), cystatin C elevation occurs only 12 to 24 hours after the insult. In comparison, novel biomarkers described in this critique can predict AKI much earlier. Additional prospective studies are required to improve our understanding about the precise diagnostic cut-off values for prediction of AKI, and other confounding variables such as method of measurement employed (nephelometry versus turbidimetry). The genomic and proteomic tools of modern science have identified novel markers for the early stress response of the kidney, which serendipitously appear in urine or plasma well before a change in serum creatinine is detected. Many are being developed and validated as early noninvasive structural damage biomarkers for the prediction of AKI and its clinical outcomes in humans. This is a rapidly evolving field and the current status of the most promising examples is summarized in the Table. The most extensively studied and validated early biomarker of AKI in children and adults is NGAL. In a prospective study of 71 children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, levels of NGAL in urine and plasma were significantly elevated within 2 hours of bypass in those who subsequently developed AKI (defined as a 50% increase in serum creatinine) 1 to 3 days after surgery. A subsequent prospective study of 374 infants and children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass confirmed these findings and additionally established cut-off thresholds, as well as a strong association between early NGAL measurements and clinical outcomes, including length of hospital stay and the duration and severity of AKI. A recent prospective multicenter study of 311 children undergoing cardiac surgery has confirmed the early rise of plasma and urine NGAL concentrations (within 6 hours after surgery) in subjects who developed an increase in serum creatinine 2 days later. Early NGAL concentrations were also shown to be associated with longer hospital and intensive care unit stays, and with longer duration of mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, the addition of NGAL significantly improved the risk prediction for AKI over clinical models alone. Studies in the more heterogeneous pediatric critical care settings have also demonstrated the ability of early NGAL measurements to predict subsequent AKI and its severity. A recent study examined a combination of urinary biomarkers in 220 children undergoing cardiac surgery. Urinary NGAL was increased in AKI patients within 2 hours of bypass initiation, urine interleukin-18 and liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) were increased within 6 hours, and urine kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) increased at the 12-hour time point. All markers correlated with AKI severity and clinical outcomes, and improved the risk prediction for AKI over clinical models. They represent temporally sequential markers and a panel of such biomarkers may therefore help establish the timing of injury and plan appropriate therapies. Standardized clinical laboratory platforms and point-of-care kits for the measurement of urine and plasma NGAL have been launched and are now available for clinical use in most countries. Normal pediatric reference ranges have been published in a study that examined levels of urine NGAL in 368 healthy children. In addition, 2 large multicenter pooled analyses of existing NGAL studies in children and adults have recently been published, confirming the utility of this marker for the early diagnosis of AKI and its clinical outcomes in several clinical scenarios. Collectively, the published literature allows for the proposal of a “cut-off” approach when using NGAL as a marker to predict AKI. In general, normal children and adults display urine NGAL values well below a cut-off of 50 ng/mL. Patients with chronic kidney disease, prerenal azotemia, and urinary tract infections generally fall within the “grey zone” of NGAL levels between 50 to 150 ng/mL. Values of NGAL above 150 ng/mL are highly predictive of intrinsic AKI. In this vignette, the urine NGAL level is extremely high at 850 ng/mL, indicative of significant structural injury to the kidney tubules and allowing for the early prediction of intrinsic AKI. The cut-offs for plasma NGAL appear to be similar to those of urine NGAL, based on published meta-analyses. It should be noted, however, that these cut-off values have not been evaluated and validated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and that NGAL has not yet been approved by the FDA for clinical use in the United States. The concept of outcomes in “biomarker-positive, creatinine-negative” patients has recently been explored. Two recent studies enrolled about 4,000 cardiac surgical, critically ill, or emergency department patients who were grouped according to their NGAL and serum creatinine status. Both studies found that measurement of the levels of NGAL complemented the information obtained by measurement of serum creatinine levels in establishing the diagnosis of AKI and predicting prognosis. A substantial proportion of patients (about 20%) had elevated NGAL levels even in the absence of loss of renal excretory function (normal serum creatinine). This previously undetectable condition (which we may now term as “subclinical AKI”) was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of death or the need for renal replacement therapy, compared to that of patients in whom levels of serum creatinine and tubule damage markers were not elevated. Notably, even in patients with significant loss of renal function, measurement of tubule damage biomarker levels still added prognostic information, as patients with increased levels of NGAL and serum creatinine levels displayed the worst prognosis by far. Overall, the data support the view that measurement of tubule damage markers such as NGAL results in a substantial added value to serum creatinine measurements. Given these considerations, NGAL and other tubule injury markers may complement a standardized diagnostic approach to AKI, and help clinicians improve their ability to make an early AKI diagnosis. There are some limitations of the use of NGAL for the diagnosis of AKI that clinicians should be aware of. First, there are age-related differences in normal NGAL values, with highest values reported in premature infants and newborns. Second, NGAL values may be falsely elevated in children with confounding conditions such as sepsis, urinary tract infections, and chronic kidney disease,even in the absence of AKI. Third, NGAL is produced largely by the distal nephron in response to injury, and it is unclear whether an isolated proximal tubule injury will result in a robust NGAL response. Besides NGAL, other promising biomarkers of tubule damage are being continually discovered in this area of intense contemporary research. For example, recently described markers of cell cycle arrest (TIMP-2 and IGFBP7) hold promise for the prediction of severe AKI, and have been approved by the FDA for clinical use, but have not been validated in children. However, markers of renal function are likely to remain important even after tubule damage markers are fully established. Glomerular filtration markers such as serum creatinine or serum cystatin C are still valuable for the diagnosis and quantification of excretory function loss (eg, for AKI staging and drug dosing) and prognosis (eg, for development of chronic kidney disease). Urine output will still represent a useful criterion for adjustments to fluid balance, and for the commencement or ending of renal replacement therapies. Structural AKI biomarkers may add substantively to our ability to detect AKI early and to refine our ability to reliably classify AKI.

      "respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation Answer: A The child has metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap. In the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis must raise the suspicion of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An inability to acidify urine despite systemic acidosis confirms the diagnosis of RTA, in particular distal RTA, because in proximal RTA, the urine acidification (pH < 5.5) occurs if the serum bicarbonate is below the renal threshold. Urine anion gap (UAG) is helpful in differentiating proximal from distal RTA. Positive values (Na+ + K+ > Cl−) indicate inappropriately low NH4+ excretion and suggest the diagnosis of distal RTA. A low urine osmolal gap value of 50 mOsm/kg H2O is consistent with urinary NH4+ and the diagnosis of RTA. Patients with distal RTA also have hypercalciuria and the renal ultrasound examination may show nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. Patients with RTA present with failure to thrive, electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperchloremia, urinary stones, nephrocalcinosis, and bone mineral disorders (rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults). Unlike adults, in whom RTA is usually secondary to acquired causes, children most often have primary forms of RTA resulting from an inherited genetic defect in the tubular proteins involved in the renal regulation of acid–base homeostasis According to their pathophysiological basis, 4 types of RTA are distinguished based on the family history, the presenting manifestations, the biochemical profile, and the radiological findings. Type 1 RTA is caused by the inability of the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting tubule to maximally increase the urinary elimination of H+ in the presence of metabolic acidosis; type 2 RTA results from impaired HCO − reabsorption in the proximal tubule; type 3 RTA is a mixed form of type 1 and type 2 3 RTA; type 4 RTA is caused mainly by defective production of ammonium (NH4+) resulting from either aldosterone deficiency or aldosterone resistance (Table). To effectively assess acid base status, the clinician is greatly assisted by reviewing simultaneous blood and urine chemistry and blood gas results. The following steps are most helpful in yielding a diagnosis: 1. Assess the serum pH as it generally indicates whether a patient is acidemic (pH < 7.38) or alkalemic (pH >7.42). 2. Assess the PCO and serum total CO /HCO values relative to the pH to determine the primary 2 2 3 cause of the pH disturbance. 3. Base Excess: Normal values range from -2 to +2 mEq/L. Positive base excess numbers are seen when there is a metabolic alkalosis, whereas negative numbers indicate the presence of a metabolic acidosis. 4. Calculate the serum anion gap, delta anion gap, and delta ratio to distinguish the cause for metabolic acidosis and to determine if there is an additional acid-base disorder anion gap = Na+ - (HCO - and Cl-)= Unmeasured anions - Unmeasured cations The normal anion gap is 12 3 ± 4 mmol/L. Patients who have high anion gaps may have increased unmeasured anions or decreased unmeasured cations. 5. Calculate the urine anion gap (UAG) as a surrogate for urine NH4 + excretion. The UAG (Na+ + K+ - Cl−) is positive in distal RTA because of inappropriately low NH4 + excretion. The UAG is typically negative in proximal RTA. Urine osmolal gap: Although not universally used, urinary NH4+ excretion can also be roughly estimated by calculating the urine osmolal gap, ie, urine osmolality – (2Na+ + 2 K+ + urea + glucose), with urea and glucose concentrations expressed in mmol/L (to convert from mg/dL to mmol/L, divide by 2.8 and 18, respectively).

      "renal artery stenosis Answer: C The differential diagnosis of high blood pressure with hypokalemia depends on the serum aldosterone level. In patients with elevated serum aldosterone levels, the potential etiologies include:  Primary aldosteronism (low renin)  Renal artery stenosis (high renin)  Cushing’s disease (normal renin) In patients with normal or low aldosterone, the differential diagnosis includes Liddle syndrome (low renin) and apparent mineralocorticoid excess. In this patient, the combination of hypokalemia, high blood pressure, low renin, and low aldosterone make the diagnosis of Liddle syndrome most likely. This is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the β or γ subunits of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), causing constitutive activation of this channel. The positive family history of her mother developing severe hypertension at an early age is also compatible with a diagnosis of Liddle syndrome. Finally, the response of the hypertension and hypokalemia to a potassium-sparing diuretic (triamterene) further corroborates with the diagnosis. The rest of the differential diagnoses listed can all feature hypokalemia and hypertension, but do not feature low renin and low aldosterone levels. The mutated region in ENaC, called the PY (Pro-Pro-x-Tyr) motif, serves as a binding site for Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase from the HECT family. Nedd4-2 binds the ENaC PY motif via its WW domains, normally leading to ENaC ubiquitylation and endocytosis, reducing the number of active channels at the plasma membrane. In Liddle syndrome, this endocytosis is impaired because of the inability of the mutated PY motif in ENaC to properly bind Nedd4-2. This leads to accumulation of active channels at the cell surface and increased sodium (and fluid) absorption in the distal nephron, resulting in elevated blood volume and blood pressure. Hypokalemia is a consequence of elevated sodium reabsorption. Genetic testing for Liddle (SCNN1B DNA sequencing, SCNN1G DNA sequencing) is now available. The laboratory features of Liddle syndrome include hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, low serum renin, and low serum aldosterone. Low urinary sodium is also a common feature. Hypokalemia and high blood pressure can usually be controlled with potassium sparing diuretics, although long standing cases may require additional medications if extensive vascular remodeling has occurred. Some patients with severe hypokalemia may develop symptoms such as weakness and fatigue, specifically muscular weakness. Future therapy may include small molecules and compounds that destabilize cell surface ENaC, or enhance Nedd4-2 activity in the kidney, which could potentially serve to alleviate hypertension.

      "vitamin D intoxication Answer : D Hyperphosphatemia is a common laboratory finding among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). With progressive CKD, filtration of serum phosphate decreases, leading to elevated levels over time, particularly as dietary intake remains stable. As CKD advances, other derangements result, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism, further elevating serum phosphate and leading to an imbalance with plasma calcium. While these factors could certainly contribute to hyperphosphatemia in CKD, the patient’s stable levels within the goal range until today without a change in renal function makes his advanced CKD an unlikely cause for his acutely elevated phosphorus today. Other causes of hyperphosphatemia related to decreased clearance include acute kidney injury related to dehydration, tubulointerstitial injury related to medication use, or with tumor lysis syndrome. This child, while without oral intake overnight for his procedure, was not dehydrated as he was given intravenous fluids overnight and his laboratory results do not indicate an acute rise in his serum creatinine. A rare cause of hyperphosphatemia is familial tumoral calcinosis. Individuals with this autosomal recessive disorder are hyperphosphatemic because the proximal tubule maximum-limited sodium-phosphorus symporter is increased from normal. The increased reabsorption of filtered phosphate that occurs as a result is hypothesized to be caused by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) deficiency. FGF23 is a phosphatonin important in phosphorus homeostasis, maintaining it in a normal range by working in concert with parathyroid hormone to inhibit the sodium-phosphorus symporter when phosphorus levels are elevated. FGF23 also inhibits calcitriol synthesis, further decreasing phosphorus levels. Hyperphosphatemia can also occur when there is an increased phosphate load. This rarely occurs in individuals with normal renal function, as the kidney is efficient in increasing urinary excretion with increased ingestion. Those at risk for this as an etiology for hyperphosphatemia are newborns, particularly when switching from human milk to cow’s milk. Neonates and young infants have relatively decreased renal function, and some may have difficulty adjusting to this increase in dietary phosphate intake, as cow’s milk has 6 times the phosphate content of human milk. Individuals receiving total parenteral nutrition may also be at risk for receiving an increased phosphate load. Fleet® enemas and other phosphate-containing enemas provide a significant phosphate load, particularly when administered with the purpose of a bowel clean out. This load is not well tolerated in individuals with advanced kidney disease, nor is it well tolerated in children younger than 2 years of age. The provision of a phospho soda enema, in the absence of other causes, is the most likely reason for the acute onset of hyperphosphatemia in the child in the vignette. Indeed, phospho soda contains 130 mg phosphorous/mL in a Fleet® enema. Vitamin D intoxication is another potential cause for hyperphosphatemia, however, the increased dose received by this child was unlikely to be the culprit. Changing his phosphate binder should not lead to an acute elevation in his serum phosphate, unless the change led to nonadherence. Finally, while dehydration could certainly lead to an elevated serum phosphate, this is usually only seen in instances of severe dehydration, often with accompanying diarrhea. Other causes of hyperphosphatemia include idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood during relapse, tumor lysis syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, severe hyperglycemia plus or minus ketoacidosis, hypoparathyroidism, acute hemolysis, acute acidosis (due to cellular shift), severe hypomagnesemia, and acromegaly. Medications causing hyperphosphatemia include growth hormone, biphosphanates, and dipyridamole. Finally, hyperphosphatemia can be the result of laboratory error; laboratory assays for phosphorus may experience interference when hyperlipidemia, hyperglobulinemia, and hyperbilirubinemia are also present. Hemolysis during blood collection can also lead to phosphorus being artificially elevated. Causes of hyperphosphatemia are listed in the Table. PREP Pearls  Hyperphosphatemia results from an increased load caused by increased intake or production or caused by decreased clearance due to renal insufficiency  Elevated phosphorus can also be caused by laboratory artifact related to comorbid conditions or hemolysis during the blood draw  Increased dietary intake usually does not cause hyperphosphatemia, except in individuals with poor kidney function, including neonates and young infants American Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)  Know the causes of hyperphosphatemia Suggested Readings  Bianchetti M, Bettinelli A.

      "sulfate Answer: A Urine stone formation is a complex process that involves several steps: 1. Supersaturation is the predominant driving force for crystallization in solutions like urine. When a salt is added to a solvent, it dissolves in the solvent until a particular concentration is reached, beyond which no further dissolution is possible. At this point, the solvent is said to be saturated with the salt. If the concentration of salt is increased, it crystallizes in solution, provided the temperature and pH are unchanged. In a complex solution such as urine, this process depends on the concentration of stone-forming ions, their chelators, ionic strength, and pH. The concentration at which saturation is reached and crystallization begins is called the thermodynamic solubility product (Ksp). 2. Nucleation is the initial step in the transformation from a liquid to a solid phase in a supersaturated solution. This process begins with the combination of stone salts in solution into loose clusters that may increase in size by addition of new components or clusters. In urine, nuclei usually form on existing surfaces, a process called heterogeneous nucleation. Epithelial cells, urinary casts, red blood cells, and other crystals can act as nucleating centers in urine. Renal tubular cell injury can promote crystallization of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals by providing substances for their heterogeneous nucleation. The crystals can attach to and subsequently enter through the epithelial cell surface. In vitro cell degradation following renal tubular cell injury produces numerous membrane vesicles, which have been shown to be good nucleators of calcium crystals. 3. Once a crystal nucleus has achieved a critical size and relative supersaturation remains above 1, the overall free energy is decreased by adding new crystal components to the nucleus, a process called crystal growth. However, it has been suggested that the importance of crystal growth for CaOx, the most abundant stone component, is questionable. Since the rate of CaOx crystal growth is low and the transit time of tubular fluid through the kidney amounts to only several minutes, it has been calculated that the probability of a single particle achieving a pathophysiologically relevant size by the process of crystal growth alone is extremely low. 4. Aggregation is the process whereby crystals in solution stick together to form larger particles. Some researchers have proposed that crystal aggregation is the most important step in stone formation. However, not all these process are involved in formation of the various stones. Clarke et al have identified at least 3 pathways that lead to stones: 1. The first pathway is overgrowth of interstitial apatite plaque (Randall plaque), as seen in idiopathic hypercalciuria, primary hyperparathyroidism, ileostomy, and small bowelresection, and in brushite stone formers. 2. In the second pathway, there are crystal deposits in renal tubules, with some associated renal injury, as seen in calcium phosphate stones. 3. The third pathway is free solution crystallization. Clear examples of this pathway are those patient groups with cystinuria, or hyperoxaluria associated with bypass surgery for obesity. If inhibitors of crystallization were not able to act, the final result will be nephrolithiasis. Inhibitors allow higher concentrations of calcium salts to be held in solution than in pure solvents. Some of these inhibitors are citrate, magnesium, and pyrophosphate. Crystal growth is also inhibited by proteins like human serum albumin, retinol binding protein, transferrin, Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, and prothrombin. Some urinary macromolecules have an inhibitory effect on CaOx crystal attachment. Lieske et al reported that diverse polyanionic molecules in urine, such as specific glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins, and citrate, block the binding of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals to the cell membrane. One common feature of molecules that inhibit COM crystal adhesion to cells is their polyanionic character. Although polyanions present in tubular fluid may coat crystals and thereby inhibit their adhesion to tubular cells, a distinct and separate set of signals acts on the cells to regulate their response to crystals that do bind. In the vignette, increased urine citrate, magnesium, pyrophosphate, and sulfate are chelators and prevent urine supersaturation, whereas increased urine calcium excretion is a risk factor for stone formation. The processes that are involved in stone formation are summarized in the Table.

      "detrusor pressure Answer : E Neurogenic bladder is a result of a lesion interrupting the nerve supply to the bladder and the sphincter. This could be at the level of the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, or the peripheral nervous system. Neurological conditions in children leading to neurogenic bladder are predominantly secondary to congenital neural tube defects. Acquired causes are secondary to spinal cord trauma, tumor, or transverse myelitis. The neurophysiology of bladder can be understood if we divide bladder function as one of passive storage and active voiding. Low pressure filling and storage and complete continence is achieved by: 1. Sympatheticα-adrenergic stimulation of bladder neck and posterior urethra, which increases tone and holds urine (T10-L2, hypogastric nerve) 2. Sympatheticβ-adrenergic stimulation of bladder fundus, which causes relaxation of bladder (detrusor) muscle 3. Somaticincrease in tone of external sphincter (S2-4, pudendal nerve) and contraction of sphincter Efficient voiding with complete emptying is achieved by: 1. Parasympathetic cholinergic activation that starts contraction of the detrusor 2. Decreased somatic output to external sphincter 3. Inhibition of sympathetic output that causes decreased bladder neck tone This coordination is maintained by brainstem micturition center. However, the voluntary control of this is by the suprapontine higher function via the cerebral cortex. The neurological connections are depicted in the Figure. The types of neurogenic bladder can thus be classified by neurological or functional components: 1. Neurological:conventionally neurological bladder is divided into different categories such as central, peripheral, or mixed depending on site of the lesion. However, thiscategory does not help in therapeutic decisions. 2. Functionalclassification: the basis of this is the pattern observed from urodynamicstudies; it examines the state of the detrusor and the sphincter, during the urodynamic study. On the basis of the findings, neurogenic bladder can be classified as:  Detrusorhyperreflexia and sphincter hyperreflexia  Detrusorhyperreflexia and flaccid sphincter  Detrusorhyporeflexia and sphincter hyporeflexia  Detrusorhyporeflexia and sphincter hyperreflexia Detrusor hyperreflexia and sphincter contractions are seen in some spina bifida lesions and in some supraspinal lesions. It is a dangerous phenomenon because there is dyssynergy between the detrusor and sphincter, creating high bladder pressures that results in kidney damage. It is often managed by anticholinergics to relax the bladder muscle and clean intermittent catheterization for emptying the bladder. Detrusor hyporeflexia with sphincter contractions also results in a large capacity bladder, which results in recurrent urinary tract infection and leads ultimately to poor compliance and upper tract damage. It is treated with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). Hyporeflexive bladder and sphincter results in a flaccid bladder. Passive voiding can be achieved by abdominal straining and Crede maneuver, however, complete emptying is rarely achieved, so CIC is still the mainstay of therapy. Usually, upper tract damage is not seen early. Detrusor hyperreflexia with sphincter relaxation results in small bladder with constant dribbling. This condition benefits from anticholinergic and bladder augment. The most important factor that determines the renal outcome in children with neurogenic bladder is the detrusor pressure. When the detrusor (filling) pressure exceeds 40 cm of H2O, glomerular filtration rate decreases and pyelocaliceal and ureteral drainage deteriorates. High intravesical pressure can impair drainage of urine into the bladder. Any pathophysiologic process that causes either intermittent or continuous elevation of bladder pressure above 40 cm of H2O places the child at risk for upper urinary tract dysfunction, and ultimately renal failure. Intermittent elevation of bladder pressure may occur from detrusor hypertonia, hyperreflexia, or both. Hyperreflexia may cause intermittent elevation of bladder pressure, especially if the external sphincter acts reflexively and tightens rather than relaxes in an attempt to prevent micturition (detrusor sphincter dyssynergia). Though the other factors mentioned in the vignette are all important, the most important determinant is the detrusor pressure. The etiology and functional types of neurogenic bladder is shown in the Table.

      "fluid removal rate in the first hour of treatment Answer : D Intradialytic hypotension is a frequently observed complication of hemodialysis (HD), occurring with 10% to 30% of all treatment sessions. It has been defined as a 20 mm Hg or greater drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) or mean arterial pressure, along with clinical symptoms requiring intervention. Typical accompanying symptoms may include muscle cramping, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or headaches before having syncope. Other more subtle symptoms may be yawning, sighing, or anxiety. The etiology of intradialytic hypotension relates to the timing of its occurrence after dialysis initiation. Hypotension, which occurs early in the treatment, may often be due to an immune-mediated reaction to one of the components of the HD treatment. A hypersensitivity reaction can occur when the patient’s blood comes into contact with the membrane, causing complement activation, bradykinin release, and vasodilation as the dialyzed blood returns to the patient. Historically, this reaction was commonly seen with cellulose-based membranes as they were less biocompatible than currently used synthetic membranes. However, this can still be seen with AN69 membranes and concomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Additionally, anaphylactoid reactions may occur within minutes of blood coming into contact with filter sterilizing agents, potting compounds, or heparin administration. More commonly, intradialytic hypotension occurs later in treatment sessions, as the ultrafiltration (UF) rate exceeds the blood volume refilling rate and the body’s normal compensatory mechanisms for hypovolemia. In the general population, hypotension is not typically seen until blood volumes drop by 25% or more. However, intradialytic hypotension occurs with much less overall fluid removal, indicating that there are patient or dialysis specific factors that contribute to its high prevalence. Elderly and diabetic adult HD patients are more likely to have intradialytic hypotension. Diastolic dysfunction, which often develops before systolic dysfunction in children on HD, can lead to decreased cardiac output and less responsiveness to hemodynamic stress. In adult patients who experience intradialytic hypotension, some degree of autonomic dysfunction has also been noted with paradoxical decreases in sympathetic responses and differences in baroreflex sensitivity. Variation in the levels of endogenous vasoconstrictors, like vasopressin and endothelin, and vasodilators, like adenosine (increases venous capacitance and splanchnic blood pooling) and nitric oxide, has also been seen. The result is that these patients have less arteriolar constriction (decreased systemic venous resistance), less venous contraction (decreased pre-load), and an inability to increase cardiac output, making them particularly prone to intradialytic hypotension. Intradialytic hypotension can be prevented by optimizing the UF rate, enhancing blood volume refill, and augmenting the body’s normal compensatory mechanisms. Accurate prescription of the dry weight is the most obvious means of avoiding overfiltration and hypotension. Use of hematocrit monitoring during HD treatments can help in determining a patient’s dry weight by seeing if refill is present once the predicted dry weight is achieved. Additionally, intradialytic monitoring of UF can determine if the rate of fluid removal is too high to cause a steep decrease in blood volume. Ultrafiltration profiling, in which the UF rate varies during dialysis treatment, allows for intermittent periods of less fluid removal during which the blood volume may refill from the interstitium and potentially avoid hypovolemia. Higher UF rates are generally better tolerated earlier in treatments when the intravascular space is more “filled”; a subsequent decrease in the UF rate, either linearly or in steps, may result in less frequent hypotension. Biofeedback systems, in which changes in blood volume are monitored by dialysate conductivity and UF rates are automatically adjusted by pre-set targets by the dialysis machine, have been shown to reduce intradialytic hypotension in adults. Sequential dialysis, which is isolated UF followed by HD, seems to be better tolerated hemodynamically, while quotidian dialysis, with more frequent HD but less fluid removal per treatment, is probably an ideal physiologic measure. Sodium profiling, in which the dialysate sodium level varies during a HD treatment, may improve blood volume refill. As fluid shifts are modulated by plasma osmolality, the expected decrease in blood urea nitrogen (and hence plasma osmolality) during a HD treatment would normally lead to less fluid shifting out of the interstitium during the later stages of a treatment session. Higher dialysate sodium levels early in a HD treatment, as programmed with sodium profiling, increases plasma osmolality and shifts more fluid from interstitial to the intravascular space. Gradual reduction of the dialysate (and thereby the plasma) sodium during a treatment helps avoid causing sodium loading of the patient, while allowing for greater fluid shifts early in the treatment session. Sodium profiling has been associated with decreases in intradialytic hypotension in some, but not all patients; use of low sodium dialysate throughout a treatment has clearly been associated with intradialytic hypotension. Similarly, increasing intravascular oncotic pressure by infusing intravenous albumin or packed red blood cells in patients at risk may also avert hypotension. Normal compensatory responses to hypovolemia include venous and arteriolar constriction. Venous constriction eliminates pooling of blood outside of the central venous system, such as in the skin and splanchnic circulation. Maneuvers to minimize this venous pooling include avoiding food during HD, use of caffeine, and keeping the patient’s core body temperature down. As net UF occurs in HD, core body temperature may increase, as there is less overall blood flow to the skin where heat is more easily dissipated. However, once body temperature reaches a certain threshold, sympathetic vasoconstriction to the skin decreases and blood flow may increase from the normal 5% to 10% up to 60% of total cardiac output. Cooling of the dialysate helps to avoid the net transfer of heat into the body and the corresponding vasodilation and potential hypotension. Isothermic dialysis, which measures dialysate temperature entering and leaving the filter, involves compensatory cooling of the dialysate to prevent any such increase in body temperature. It was previously thought that hemodiafiltration was effective in avoiding intradialytic hypotension by better clearance of middle- sized molecules with cardiac depressive effects, but it is now thought that hemodiafiltration has greater cooling effects of the blood with the use of pre-filter replacement fluid. Arteriolar vasoconstriction, as previously mentioned, will increase systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output. Midodrine, an α-adrenergic agonist, may be given before HD to maintain vasoconstriction and prevent hypotension. However, it is dialyzed and supplemental doses may need to be given during treatments. Similarly, withholding anti-hypertensive medications prior to dialysis may be helpful, but this may be less efficacious with anti-hypertensive medications that are easily dialyzed, such as ACE inhibitors and atenolol. Myocardial and vascular smooth muscle constriction may also decrease with the use of acetate (versus bicarbonate) buffer and low calcium dialysate, as both have been associated with intradialytic hypotension. Decreasing the blood flow during dialysis or the surface area of the membrane has not been proven to prevent hypotension. The short term concern with intradialytic hypotension is the patient’s immediate cardiovascular stability. This is often addressed by decreasing fluid removal or giving a bolus of crystalloid solution to restore circulating volume. With continued symptoms, the patient may need to be placed in Trendelenburg position. It is rare that vasoactive drugs are needed acutely. However, the greater concern is the long term effect of repetitive episodes of intradialytic hypotension. There is an association of increased mortality in patients who have intradialytic hypotension. It has been shown that patients may experience “myocardial stunning” during these periods of hypoperfusion that may result in increased cardiac fibrosis and ventricular dysfunction. Additionally, in adult patients, intradialytic hypotension has been associated with cerebrovascular incidents with lacunar or watershed infarcts. In this vignette, decreasing the dialysate temperature (response D) is the preferred response and is one method to avoid intradialytic hypotension. Decreasing the dialysate calcium (response B) or sodium (response C) concentrations have been associated with causing intradialytic hypotension from decreasing vascular smooth muscle contraction and blood volume refill from the interstitium, respectively. Decreasing the fluid removal rate in the first hour of treatment (response E), instead of increasing in the first hour, is the direct opposite of another appropriate intervention. Decreasing the ACE inhibitor dose (response A) could help avert hypotension, but is less likely to be effective in the last hour of a treatment, when the drug is likely to be completely dialyzed already. PREP Pearls  Intradialytic hypotension occurring at initiation of a hemodialysis (HD) treatment is less common and is more likely to be an immune-mediated response to either the membrane or medication  Hypotension occurring later during HD is often from an imbalance of fluid removal, vascular refilling, and the body’s normal compensatory mechanisms.  Appropriate dry weight measurement, ultrafiltration profiling, sodium profiling, and lowering of dialysate temperature are all measures that may prevent the development of intradialytic hypotension American Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)  Know how to recognize, treat, and prevent hemodialysis-induced hypotension Suggested Readings  Davenport A.

      "plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) Answer : E The progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) often has a common histologic appearance, despite the different primary etiology of renal disease, with glomerulosclerosis, vascular changes, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Therefore, it would appear that there is a common pathway of progression that is seen contributing to loss of renal function. There are several possible contributors to progressive nephron loss in CKD, including the different cellular responses to intraglomerular hemodynamics, inflammation, and cell differentiation signals that seem to all be intertwined. The compensatory response to nephron loss is hyperfiltration by the spared nephrons in an attempt to maintain the glomerular filtration rate. Angiotensin II (AT2) may be generated locally, altering glomerular capillary pressures through hemodynamic changes, but AT2 also has effects on cytokine production in the glomerulus and downstream in the tubules and renal interstitium. Increased cytokine production contributes to glomerular cell hypertrophy, which can help to try and maintain renal function. However, this cytokine production may be dysregulated and result in accumulation of extracellular matrix, disruption of the cellular-matrix architecture, cellular proliferation, and potential glomerulosclerosis. Additionally, hyperfiltration results in excess proteins being endocytosed by the tubules, aberrant cytokine production, and possible dysregulation of the inflammatory response and matrix production that causes interstitial fibrosis. Since inflammation, or the different cellular responses to it, seems to have a central role in this process, interventions to mitigate the inflammatory response or limit the degree of dysregulation in the kidney may have a role in limiting progression of CKD and nephron loss. The difficulty is the complexity of the immune system, with countless cytokines and downstream intracellular signal responses, redundancies built in throughout, as well as the need for some degree of normal responsiveness to allow for appropriate cellular responses to internal signals, oxidative stress, and harmful antigenic exposure. A list of some of the cytokines or markers of inflammation that have been considered potential targets of treatment to limit nephron loss is discussed in this critique. Transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1) is a profibrotic cytokine that has been found to have a very significant role in chronic renal diseases. At physiologic levels, TGF-ß1 is essential for normal development and tissue repair. However, overexpression of this cytokine causes pathological alterations in several different renal cell types. TGF-ß1 has been shown to cause increased extracellular matrix production by mesangial cells and podocytes, contributing to glomerulosclerosis. It also induces the transition of endothelial cells to fibroblasts, causing capillary loss and fibrotic changes in both the glomerulus and interstitium. Lastly, TGF-ß1 also contributes to tubulointerstitial fibrosis by inducing epithelial cell apoptosis and tubular atrophy. TGF-ß1 production is induced by AT2, representing a potential pathway in which angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may offer renoprotection and limit fibrosis. As TGF-ß1 is considered to be a significant contributor to the progression of renal injury, it is also a major target for therapeutic interventions, but with limited success to date. A list of other inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors which have been implicated in the progression of renal injury, along with some therapeutics which target them, are in the Table. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a short pentraxin, an inflammatory protein of distinctive structure, which responds quickly to both humoral and cellular systems of inflammation, making it an acute phase reactant. Although CRP may elevate to very high levels in the face of an acute infection, it may remain chronically elevated in patients with CKD and contribute to increased risk of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic lesions, acting as a marker, mediator, and predictor of vascular disease. As it may increase from different immunologic stimuli, CRP also may be decreased by the use of several different types of drugs, including cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin, celecoxib), platelet aggregation inhibitors, lipid lowering agents (statins, diet, niacin), antidiabetic agents (not insulin), and some (but not all) ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It has not been shown to be lowered by the use of thiazide diuretics or aldosterone antagonists. Interleukin-1 ß (IL-1 ß) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine predominantly produced by activated macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Dysregulated IL-1 production may be seen in concert with other inflammatory markers, like tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interferon-? (IFN- ?), and IL-6. It increases the adhesion and migration of circulating immune cells, so it is most associated with auto- inflammatory syndromes like rheumatoid arthritis. Its expression is also increased with glomerular endothelial injury and it contributes to the changes seen in experimental models of crescentic glomerulonephritis. However, IL-1 also plays a role in inflammatory activation of resident fibroblasts and is a mediator of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, has been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and myeloma. Aldosterone antagonists have been shown to reduce TNF-a and IFN-? levels in vitro, but have not affected IL-1 levels in reproduced studies. Nuclear factor-? B (NF-?B) is a primary transcription factor in most cells, which plays a crucial role in responding to bacterial or viral infections. It becomes activated by receptors to proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1), travels from the cytosol to the nucleus, and can stimulate transcription of many of the genes involved in the inflammatory response. NF-?B may remain chronically active in many inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, asthma, and atherosclerosis, while it has also been associated with some cancers. However, it may be inhibited by a variety of compounds, including glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, anti-oxidants, and other natural compounds. In animal models, aldosterone has been shown to inhibit NF-?B production. Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, can prevent this inhibition, thus increasing NF-?B levels and its proinflammatory effects. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR-?) is a transcription factor that has been shown to play a critical role in adipocyte differentiation, glucose homeostasis, cellular proliferation regulation, and inflammatory responses in the kidney. One group of PPAR-? agonists, the thiazolidinedione derivatives commonly known as rosiglitazone or pioglitazone, are noted to have potent effects on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and subsequently were first studied for treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. These same drugs also inhibit the proliferation of mesangial cells that is induced by a variety of growth factors. Aldosterone has also been implicated as having a role in mesangial cell proliferation and it appears that use of PPAR-? agonists may actually limit aldosterone production. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a protease inhibitor that is produced by the endothelium and primarily acts as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis. However, in the setting of inflammatory response, it has a significant role in the progression of tissue fibrosis by enhancing cell migration and epithelial- mesenchymal transition. Increased levels of PAI-1 have been associated with atherosclerotic disease, renal interstitial fibrosis, and glomerulosclerosis. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels can be decreased by inhibition of AT2 and aldosterone, independent of TGF-ß activation. This is one pathway that spironolactone, as well as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, may directly decrease glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. For the patient in the vignette who has progressive CKD, one must carefully consider the effects of an aldosterone inhibitor on the various inflammatory mediators. An aldosterone antagonist will inhibit PAI-1 levels, potentially decreasing the glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. While CRP and IL-1 may be contributing to CKD progression, their levels will be unaffected by an aldosterone antagonist. The NF-KB levels will be increased, not decreased by aldosterone antagonists. In addition, as mentioned previously, evidence that aldosterone attenuates PPAR-? suggests that the most likely effect of aldosterone antagonists would be to stimulate PPAR-? expression. PREP Pearls  Glomerular hyperfiltration may result in increased protein endocytosis by the tubules, increased local cytokine production, an aberrant inflammatory response, and interstitial fibrosis.  Angiotensin II (AT2) contributes to progressive renal injury through both changes to glomerular hemodynamics, as well as stimulation of cytokine production in both the glomerulus and the interstitium. Preventing the effect of AT2 binding of its receptor, by either limiting AT2 production or blocking receptor binding, can limit some of these deleterious effects.
