    "explanation": "A. BBS10 gene resulting in primary cilia dysfunction\nThe Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in 1 of the 18 (to\ndate) genes (BBS1-18), which results in a primary cilia dysfunction. In northern European individuals, BBS1\nand BBS10 are the most common allelic mutations, and BBS1, BBS10, and BBS12 mutations account for 75%\nof the identified mutational load. There may be modifying genes that affect the phenotype resulting from\nindividual BBS gene mutations.\nThe protein product of BBS8 has been shown to localize to the centrosome and basal body and interacts with\nthe pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1), which is a protein important for ciliogenesis. The protein product of BBS4\nfunctions in the microtubule apparatus and interacts with subunits of dynactin, implying a role in retrograde\nintraflagellar transport. The BBS proteins are likely involved in the production and maintenance of the\ncilia/centrosome complex owing to the roles of cilia, and may also be important for various signaling pathways.\nOnce thought to be evolutionary vestiges with no obvious function, their role in vertebrate physiology in now\nbeing elucidated. Recent studies demonstrate that the cilium are indispensable for certain key developmental\nsignaling cascades. While the genetics of BBS are important, understanding the molecular mechanisms of BBS\nmay enhance our knowledge about renal development and diseases such as polycystic kidney and ciliopathies.\nThe ophthalmological manifestations of BBS include retinitis pigmentosa, color blindness, macular edema,\ndegeneration, and optic atrophy. Night blindness first manifests when the child is around 8 years of age and is\nfollowed by loss of peripheral vision, usually progressing to legal blindness by 15 years of age.\nRenal manifestations of BBS are very common, affecting of to 80% of patients. Manifestations include chronic\nkidney disease, cystic kidney disease, renal dysplasia, vesicoureteral reflux, unilateral agenesis, caliectasis, and\nhydronephrosis.\nThe mean body mass index is 31.5 kg/m2 in males and 36.6 kg/m2 in females with BBS. Males have\nhypogenitalism and 8% have maldescended testes, while females report irregular menstrual cycles. Postaxial\npolydactyly is present on all 4 limbs in 21% of patients, on the hands only in 9% of patients, and on only the\nfeet in 21% of patients. COL4A5 mutation leading to disruption of synthesis of type 4 collagen is the mutation\nand functional abnormality causing Alport syndrome. PKD1 mutation leading to cystogenesis is the gene and\nfunctional abnormality that causes autosomal dominate polycystic kidney disease. PKHD1 gene mutation\nresults in fibrocystin dysfunction and is the gene and functional abnormality that causes autosomal recessive\npolycystic kidney disease. TSC1 gene mutation results in loss of tumor suppression function and is the gene and\nfunctional abnormality that leads to the tuberous sclerosis complex.\n\nPREP Pearls\n The genetic mutations in Bardet-Biedl syndrome are in the BBS1-18 gene sequence.\n The gene protein products of the BBS1-18 genes result in dysfunction of the cilium\n The clinical manifestation of Bardet-Biedl syndrome include renal disease, rod-cone dystrophy, polydactyly,\ntruncal obesity, and hypogonadism.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the molecular and genetic basis for Bardet-Biedel syndrome\nSuggested Readings\n Janssen S, Ramaswami G, Davis EE, et al.

These might be new drugs or\ncombinations of drugs, new surgical procedures or devices, or novel ways of using existing therapies. Clinical\ntrials to develop or evaluate clinical laboratory tests (eg, imaging or molecular diagnostic tests) can be\nconsidered a clinical trial if the test will be used for medical decision-making for the subject or if the test itself\nimposes more than minimal risk for subjects. Every clinical trial has a leader (principal investigator) and\ninternal (and sometimes external) research members who periodically monitor the study’s safety and\neffectiveness. Clinical trials should be planned with a primary outcome and should be registered before\npublication. Another monitoring body is the institutional review board; it is an independent committee that\nconsists of physicians, statisticians, and members of the community who ensure that the clinical trials are ethical\nand safe. Sponsorship of the clinical trial can be via local, national, federal, or private organizations. Finally,\nevery clinical trial must have an informed consent, ie, the process by which participants gain knowledge about\nthe study before they decide to enroll. Participants are free to withdraw from the study completely or to refuse\nparticular treatments or tests. However, in some studies, this will make them ineligible to continue the study.\nClinical research studies proceed according to a well-defined protocol that is carefully designed to protect the\nhuman subjects, while answering specific research questions. The protocol describes the eligibility to participate\nin the study, details regarding tests or procedures, length of study, and information gained from the study.\nThe overarching goal of clinical trials is to determine whether new biomedical or behavioral interventions are\nsafe and effective. The Table lists the type of clinical trials.\nTable. Types of Clinical Trials.\nPhase I clinical trials test a new biomedical intervention in a small group of people (eg, 20-80) for the\nfirst time to evaluate safety (eg, to determine a safe dosage range, or pharmacokinetic or\npharmacodynamic) and to identify potential adverse effects.\nPhase II clinical trials study the biomedical or behavioral intervention in a larger group of people\n(several hundred) to determine its efficacy and safety.\nPhase III studies investigate the efficacy of the biomedical or behavioral intervention in large groups of\nhuman subjects (from several hundred to several thousand) by comparing the intervention to other\nstandard or experimental interventions as well as to monitor adverse effects, and to collect information\nthat will allow the intervention to be used safely.\nPhase IV studies are conducted after the intervention is approved by the US Food and Drug\nAdministration and is marketed (postmarket study). These studies are designed to monitor effectiveness\nand optimal use of the approved intervention in the general population and to collect information about\nany adverse effects associated with widespread use.\n(Courtesy of S El-Dahr)\n\nPREP Pearls\n Clinical trials involve the study of human subjects, involve the use of 1 or more interventions, prospectively\nassign human subjects to an intervention, and carries a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome.\n Clinical trials are monitored for ethical and safety-related issues by an institutional review board, and require the\nparticipant to sign an informed consent.\n A clinical trial proceeds through four well defined phases from beginning to completion in order to be US Food\nand Drug Administration-approved and marketed.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Distinguish between Phase I, II, III, and IV clinical trials\nSuggested Readings\n Umscheid CA, Margolis DJ, Grossman CE.

    "explanation": "E. immaturity of Na,K-ATPase activity in the proximal tubule\nAs exemplified by the vignette, hyponatremia is a common occurrence in premature neonates. Between 30% to\n60% of very low birth weight neonates have hyponatremia (defined as serum sodium levels of < 130 mEq/L) in\nthe first week after birth, and 25% to 65% thereafter until the end of the neonatal period. This condition is\nattributable primarily to renal salt wasting. Immaturity of Na,K-ATPase activity in the proximal tubule results\nin impaired sodium reabsorption, which subsequently results in greater distal sodium delivery. The limited\naldosterone responsiveness of the distal tubule further contributes to the hyponatremia. Intestinal absorption is\nalso limited because of immaturity of Na,K-ATPase in the gut, and intakes of sodium are often low.\nHyponatremia attributable to water retention can also be observed in special situations, particularly after\nsurgical procedures, septic shock, cyclooxygenase inhibitor treatment, or renal failure, but none of these\nsituations apply to the vignette. In contrast to the majority of renal transport systems, the immature and neonatal\nmammal exhibits a dramatically greater apical membrane density of the Na+-phosphate cotransporter, which is\nrequired to maintain a positive phosphate balance that characterizes early extrauterine life.\nEvery effort should be made to keep serum Na concentrations in the normal range. Hyponatremia in preterm\nneonates is often an iatrogenic complication that should be preventable because newborns start out life with\nnormal serum Na concentrations. One practice that needs to be reconsidered is how parenteral fluids are being\nprescribed to the preterm neonate. Current recommendations are to prescribe 5% dextrose in water, only adding\nsodium after weight loss has been achieved. The reason for this recommendation is the concern that sodium\nsupplementation in the immediate postnatal period will lead to extracellular volume expansion with the\ndevelopment of hypernatremia, worsening respiratory distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, and patent ductus\narteriosus. Unfortunately, this approach has resulted in a high incidence of hyponatremia of up to 60%. Even\ngroups that advocate more aggressive sodium supplementation have reported a 14% incidence of hyponatremia\nin otherwise healthy preterm neonates.\nHyponatremia is associated with deleterious consequences in the preterm neonate. Preterm neonates on sodium-\nrestricted diets have an increased incidence of hyponatremia with impaired neonatal growth and worse\nneurodevelopment at 10 to 13 years of age when compared with a matched sodium-supplemented group. It was\nrecently demonstrated that the degree of hyponatremia in preterm neonates is predictive of both increased salt\nappetite and dietary sodium intake in adolescence, resulting in hyponatremic neonates that weigh 30% more\nthan their peers.\nThere is abundant evidence associating hyponatremia with adverse neurologic developmental outcomes.\nHyponatremia was a factor associated with increased risk of cerebral palsy after adjustment for gestational age\nand prenatal and intrapartum risk factors. Hyponatremia was a risk factor for hearing loss in preterm infants.\n\nMoreover, overcorrection of chronic hyponatremia has been associated with both central and extrapontine\nmyelinolysis, although this has rarely been described for infants. Baraton et al showed that very preterm infants\nwho experienced large changes (8–13 mEq/L) or very large changes (>13 mEq/L) in serum sodium levels\nduring the first month of life had greater risks of developing impaired functional outcomes by corrected age of 2\nyears, compared with infants with changes in serum sodium levels of less than 8 mEq/L (8 mmol/L). Baraton et\nal adjusted for several prenatal and postnatal characteristics to demonstrate unbiased relationships between large\nand very large changes in serum sodium levels and impaired functional outcomes at corrected age of 2 years.\nAl-Dahhan et al performed neurodevelopmental performance tests on premature children (gestational age of 33\nweeks or less) allocated to diets containing 1 to 1.5 mmol sodium/day (unsupplemented) or 4 to 5 mmol\nsodium/day (supplemented) from the fourth to the 14th postnatal day and who were recalled at the age of 10 to\n13 years. Children who had been in the supplemented group performed better in all modalities tested than those\nfrom the unsupplemented group. The differences were statistically significant (analysis of variance) for motor\nfunction, performance IQ, the general memory index, and behavior as assessed by the children's parents. The\nsupplemented children outperformed the unsupplemented controls by 10% in all 3 components of the memory\nand learning tests (difference not significant but p < 0.1 for each), and in language function (p < 0.05 for object\nnaming) and educational attainment (p < 0.05 for arithmetic age).\nPREP Pearls\n Hyponatremia is associated with deleterious consequences in the preterm neonate.\n Hyponatremia in immature infants is primarily caused by renal salt wasting.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know about the differences between premature and term infants in their ability to handle sodium\nSuggested Readings\n Al-Dahhan J, Jannoun L, Haycock GB.

Feb 15;304(4):F333-47.\nImmunofluorescence is typically negative, but nonspecific trapping of immunoglobulin M (IgM) may be\npresent in glomeruli.\nIn children, most MCD is idiopathic in origin. However, it is important to recognize that minimal change\nlesions can also occur secondary to other conditions, including neoplasia, infection, allergies, and medications.\n\nData in children are lacking, but in adults with neoplasias and nephrotic syndrome, 40% will have histologic\nfindings of MCD on renal biopsy. A history of weight loss, anorexia, lymphadenopathy, or fever in the setting\nof MCD should prompt investigation for an underlying neoplasia. Non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma are\nthe most common neoplasias associated with MCD. Overall, MCD remains a rare complication of Hodgkin\nlymphoma, affecting only 1 out of 2 to 10,000 cases.\nMinimal change disease is also associated with use of prescription and over-the-counter medications (such as\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and herbal remedies. NSAIDs can induce nephrotic syndrome\nwith the appearance of MCD on biopsy. Often, there is associated acute kidney injury, with decreased\nglomerular filatration. In addition to MCD, tubulointerstitial nephritis may be present on renal biopsy. Other\nless common medications that have been reported in associated with MCD include gold, antibiotics (ampicillin,\nrifampin, cefixime), trimethadione, lithium, interferons, tamoxifen, penicillamine, and probenacid).\nA history of atopy is associated with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome and MCD. In particular, milk and pork\nallergies and bee stings have been associated with MCD. In some cases, avoiding allergens may decrease\nrelapses in MCD.\nSecondary minimal change nephrosis has been reported in associated with many infections, including viruses\nsuch as syphilis and HIV, bacteria such as Mycoplasma, and parasites such as ehrlichiosis, Echinococcus, and\nschistosomiasis. Treatment of the underlying infection will often result in resolution of MCD.\nIn a 16-year-old female with nephrotic syndrome, it would be important to consider and evaluate for secondary\ncauses of nephrotic syndrome. HIV, syphilis, NSAIDs, and Hodgkin lymphoma are all potential secondary\ncauses of MCD. However, the most likely diagnosis remains idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, making C the\ncorrect answer.\nPREP Pearls\n Minimal change nephrosis can be a presentation of underlying neoplasia, or infection, including syphilis, HIV, or\nmalaria.\n Up to 30% of patients with minimal change disease can have microscopic hematuria on presentation, but most\nmicroscopic hematuria will resolve with treatment.\n Minimal change disease secondary to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is often associated with interstitial\nnephritis.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the differential diagnosis for the clinical presentation and histologic lesion of minimal lesion nephrotic\nsyndrome\n\nSuggested Readings\n Churg J, Habib R, White RH.

    "explanation": "E.\nFig E.\nIn the vignette, the patient has lupus nephritis, neurological symptoms and antiphospholipid antibodies. A\nkidney biopsy is most likely to show thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) with fibrin thrombi in glomerular\ncapillaries, as shown by arrows in Figure E\n. Figure A\n\ndemonstrates a focal sclerotic lupus lesion; Figure B\n\ndemonstrates focal proliferative lupus lesion; Figure C\n\ndemonstrates membranous glomerulonephritis with a segmental proliferative lesion; and Figure D\n\ndemonstrates membranous glomerulonephritis with a global proliferative lesion. While all of these histological\nchanges can be seen in patients with lupus nephritis, the clinical course in this patient is most consistent with\nTMA, making E the best answer.\nThis patient presents with the triad of acute renal failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia in the setting of altered\nmental status with blood work consistent with a diagnosis of lupus nephritis. Thrombotic microangiopathy\nshould be high on the differential diagnosis for causes of altered mental status, antiphospholipid antibodies, and\nacute renal failure in this patient. All TMA patients present with schistocytes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase,\nand decreased haptoglobin.\nThrombotic microangiopathy must be differentiated from other causes of hemolytic anemia such as Coombs\npositive autoimmune hemolytic anemia, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Hemolytic\nanemia is diagnosed by Coombs test and should not have thrombocytopenia. Disseminated intravascular\ncoagulation is diagnosed by a combination of thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time and partial\nthromboplastin time, increased fibrin degradation products (D-Dimer), low fibrinogen, schistocytes on\nperipheral smear, and anemia. Another differentiating feature is that TMA often presents with malignant\nhypertension, whereas patients with hemolytic anemia and DIC would be more likely to be normotensive or\nhypotensive.\n\nThrombotic microangiopathy can be primary (as in genetic causes) or secondary (due to systemic diseases such\nas vasculitis (lupus), infections, or medications such as calcineurin inhibitors). The underlying characteristic\nhistopathological finding in TMA is hyaline thrombi in blood vessels. The manifestations and classification\ndepend both on location and underlying mechanism of the disease.\nSecondary TMA in the setting of vasculitis may involve not only the kidney, but arterial thrombosis of other\norgans. Most commonly, it occurs with lupus in the setting of anti-phospholipid antibodies.\nPrimary TMA is often classified as either thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or hemolytic uremic\nsyndrome (HUS). While the symptoms overlap between TTP and HUS, the underlying pathophysiology appears\ndifferent in TTP and HUS.\nThe pathophysiology of TTP relates to ADAMTS13. Neonatal onset TTP is caused by gene mutations in the\nADAMTS13, while childhood onset TTP is caused by autoantibodies to ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13 degrades\nvon Willebrand factor and its deficiency predisposes to coagulation cascade and clot formation. Thrombotic\nthrombocytopenic purpura can be diagnosed by measurement of ADAMTS13 activity, detection of\nADAMTS13 circulating inhibitors or autoantibodies, and, in some cases, sequencing of the ADAMTS13 gene.\nClinically, TTP is often triggered by infections and has a chronic relapsing course. Typically, it results in severe\nhemolytic anemia and TCP. Platelet consumption in clots can result in local ischemia and visceral organ\ndysfunction. The classic \"pentad\" includes TCP, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, fever, and\nneurological manifestations. Skin manifestations (petechiae and purpura) may be present. Predominantly\nneurological involvement is characteristic of patients with TTP, as compared to the predominant renal failure\nmanifestation of those with HUS.\nHemolytic uremic syndrome (both diarrheal associated and atypical) are types of TMA. Diarrheal-associated\nHUS results from Shiga toxin-induced endothelial (STEC) injury and typically presents with a diarrheal illness\n(bloody or nonbloody). Identification of STEC toxin helps differentiate these patients from atypical HUS.\nAtypical HUS tends to have a more indolent, relapsing course, and is the result of abnormalities in the\nalternative complement regulatory pathway.\nCalcineurin-induced TMA is a well known rare complication in 1% of patients on tacrolimus\nimmunosuppression. The mechanism of calcineurin-induced TMA is unclear, but it may be due to endothelial\ninjury, vasoconstriction, and prothrombin and fibrinolytic effects.\nThrombotic microangiopathy occurs in lupus, particularly in the setting of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).\nSevere hypertension, hematuria, proteinuria and renal insufficiency are common to APS-TMA. Fibrin thrombi\nin glomeruli and renal arterioles are diagnostic for TMA. Complexes of antiphospholipid antibodies with\n\nphospholipid may induce TMA in glomeruli. Thrombotic microangiopathy can also occur in the absence of\nimmune complexes and inflammatory cells, and does not associate with a specific histologic class of lupus\nnephritis.\nTable.

Historically, the original\ndescription is attributed to either Whistler or Glisson, both practicing in England in the mid-1600s. The origin\nof the word could have been from “Wricken,” which means twisted in German. Common clinical features of\nrickets are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1. Clinical Features seen in Ricketts.

However, this store gets depleted and, if the baby is\nexclusively breastfed, then adequate vitamin D is not obtained unless vitamin D supplementation is provided.\nDark skin is also risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. If the mother is deficient in vitamin D, then the newborn\nbaby has low 25 OH levels which predispose to hypocalcemia in the immediate post partum period and rickets\neven in the first few months of life.\nThe biochemical features of vitamin D deficiency rickets are usually low-normal calcium because parathyroid\nhormone (PTH) is stimulated to maintain serum calcium levels. Sometimes, this mechanism may be insufficient\nand calcium concentration falls. Increased PTH stimulates renal excretion of phosphorus and its serum level\ndecreases even before changes in serum calcium become noticeable. Serum alkaline phosphatase is higher than\nnormal because of an increased bone turnover. Sometimes, patients may have low serum bicarbonate due to\nproximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) caused by high PTH. Serum 25OH vitamin D (25D) level is low (below\n10 ng/mL) in patients with clinical evidence of vitamin D deficiency rickets. Deficiency is defined as 25D\nconcentrations less than 20 ng/mL. 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) concentration is normal or high in most\ncases of nutritional rickets, as high PTH levels stimulate 1,25D. Generally, in patients with a clinical diagnosis\n\nof nutritional rickets, the diagnosis is confirmed by checking serum 25D level and it is not necessary to check\n1,25D level.\nThe biochemical defects in various forms of rickets are presented in Table 2.\nThe patient in the vignette presents in late infancy with clinical features suggestive of rickets; the patient’s dark\nskin and exclusive breast feeding puts him at risk for developing vitamin D deficiency rickets. Low normal\ncalcium with elevated PTH, alkaline phosphatase, and low phosphorus support the diagnosis of vitamin D\ndeficient rickets. Adequate treatment with vitamin D results in clinical improvement with rapid acceleration of\nmotor milestones. The biochemical feature of low 25D and high 1,25D would be the most consistent feature of\nvitamin D deficiency rickets. A defect in 1α hydroxylase causes normal 25D level, but low 1,25D level. 1,25D\nbinds to the vitamin D receptor; mutations in the ligand receptor or DNA binding domain cause elevated 1,25D\nlevels with normal or elevated 25D levels. Rickets with normal 25D and 1,25D levels are usually seen in\nhypophosphatasia, which is a deficiency of alkaline phosphatase causing accumulation of mineralization\ninhibitors. None of these conditions would respond to treatment with vitamin D as well.\n\nPREP Pearls\n Since rickets primarily affects the bones, the clinical signs are also observed in osseous tissues.\n Biochemical features of vitamin D deficiency rickets are usually low-normal calcium, low-normal phosphorus,\nelevated parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase levels.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know clinical and laboratory evaluation of vitamin D-deficient rickets\nSuggested Readings\n Elder CJ, Bishop NJ.

    "explanation": "E. proximal tubular cell necrosis\nThe kidney is important in excretion of many organic compounds including medications. As a result of this\nfunction, it is liable to injury from many of the medications and toxins. Since the process of elimination\ninvolves filtration, tubular secretion, and, in some instances, transformation to metabolites, injury can be\nsustained in a variety of ways. Some of the important reasons for unique susceptibility of kidneys for injury are:\n1. Kidney receives a robust blood supply, thereby exposing it to the toxic effects of the drugs.\n2. Multiple pathways to affect tubules such as filtration or secretion or reabsorption (eg, entry into renal tubular\nepithelial cells via pinocytosis or endocytosis, or transportation via peritubular capillaries and access to renal\ntubular epithelial cells at the basolateral surface, where they are taken up by organic anion and organic cation\ntransporters [OATs and OCTs, respectively] and eventually secreted into tubular lumens)\n3. As tubular fluid flows down the loop of Henle, water is reabsorbed, thus increasing the tubular concentration of\ndrug to potentially injurious levels.\n4. Crystallization is highly favored with the acidic urine pH that exists in the normal host with average protein\nintake, which makes the kidney-specific environment contribute to nephrotoxicity\nSome of the common nephrotoxins and mechanism of injury due to these toxins include:\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nProstaglandin (PG) inhibition mediated by NSAIDs explains many of its renal complications. The PG-induced\nrenal vasodilation is critical for maintaining adequate renal perfusion. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nimpair this renal vasodilation and alter renal hemodynamics. This effect is magnified in patients who are\nhypovolemic or are concomitantly using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It is important to\nnote that acute kidney injury (AKI) can occur with either nonselective NSAIDs or selective (COX-2-specific)\nNSAIDs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also cause sodium and water retention. In addition to renal\nfunctional changes, NSAIDs can also tubulointerstitial nephritis. Long-term use has been linked to papillary\nnecrosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nACE inhibitors\nThe ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) antagonize the activity of angiotensin II,\nthereby interfering with the renal autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Though this effect is well\ntolerated in most patients, in certain situations, impairment of autoregulation could precipitate or potentiate\nAKI. These situations include: 1) bilateral renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis in solitary kidney; 2)\nvolume depletion; and 3) concomitant use of NSAIDs, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus.\nAntimicrobial agents\nAminoglycosides (AG)\n\nAminoglycosides are nonprotein-bound and freely filtered at the glomeruli. Aminoglycosides can undergo\nproximal tubule reabsorption by megalin-mediated endocytosis. This leads to a preferential accumulation of the\ndrug in the cortical tubular cells, which results in tubular cytotoxicity. Once injury occurs, lysosomal membrane\nreleases both the AG and lysosomal enzymes, which causes cell injury and necrosis. This preferentially\ninvolves the most proximal segment of the nephron. The risk for nephrotoxicity is directly proportional to the\ncationic charge. Neomycin is the most toxic drug in this group, followed by gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin,\nand streptomycin (least toxic). Intracellular accumulation results either in tubular cell death or in functional\nalteration of cell membrane transporters. The earliest clinically detectable abnormality is enzymuria. Clinical\nmanifestations are usually either alteration of renal function or, rarely, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia,\nhypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia). Risk for nephrotoxicity is higher with prolonged duration of therapy or\nconcomitant use of other nephrotoxic medications. Clinically, AKI manifests after 5 to 7 days of therapy. Renal\ncomplications are usually dose-dependent.\nTrimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)\nTrimethoprim inhibits proximal tubular secretion of creatinine and can result in elevation of measured serum\ncreatinine. However, this effect is not accompanied by a decrease in actual GFR and therefore should not be\nconsidered as AKI. The TMP can also result in hyperkalemia by inhibiting the epithelial sodium channel at the\ndistal convoluted tubule, which provides the driving force for potassium excretion. Acute kidney injury from\nsulfa-based antimicrobial agents is most commonly secondary to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Use of high-\ndose sulfadiazine can, on rare occasions, also cause crystal nephropathy. Urine microscopy in this case may\nreveal the characteristic birefringent, needle-shaped crystals arranged in a “shocks of wheat” pattern. Crystal\nprecipitation typically occurs in acidic urine and in low-flow states.\nVancomycin (VCM)\nNephrotoxicity related to VCM is generally caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or AIN. The exact\nnephrotoxic mechanism of VCM-related ATN is not yet fully established. It has been suggested that VCM-\ninduced oxidative stress results in the tubular damage.\nCiprofloxacin\nCiprofloxacin, a commonly prescribed fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has been reported to cause AIN and\ncrystalluria. Ciprofloxacin crystallizes in alkaline urine. Crystals can sometimes be visualized by polarized\nmicroscopy as birefringent needles, stars, or sheaves.\nOther antibiotics\n\nPenicillins and cephalosporins are commonly used antimicrobial agents and have been found, although rarely,\nto cause AIN and ATN. Polymyxins (colistin and polymyxin B) cause AKI by toxic tubular injury.\nAntivirals\nAcyclovir\nAcyclovir is primarily excreted by the kidneys. High-dose intravenous use of acyclovir can induce AKI\nsecondary to crystal precipitation in the renal tubules. Acyclovir crystals can sometimes be detected by urine\nsediment microscopy. Typically, they are birefringent, needle-shaped crystals.\nAntiretroviral agents\nThe most prominent of the nephrotoxic antiretroviral agents is tenofovir, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitor that can cause AKI with or without proximal tubulopathy. Acute kidney injury results from direct\ntoxicity to tubular cells, mediated by mitochondrial injury, resulting in ATN. Proximal tubular dysfunction\npresents as electrolyte derangements, including an overt Fanconi syndrome. Protease inhibitors, another class of\nantiretroviral drugs, can also be nephrotoxic. Indinavir, a once-prominent protease inhibitor, can crystallize in\nrenal tubules, resulting in crystal-related kidney injury and nephrolithiasis.\nCidofovir\nThis is an antiviral agent used against adeno- and polyomaviruses. It undergoes both glomerular filtration and\ntubular secretion. It causes direct tubular toxicity resulting in proximal tubular necrosis. The mechanism of\ntoxicity may be by interfering with synthesis and degradation of membrane phospholipids.\nAntifungal\nAmphotericin B (AmB)\nAmphotericin B is an unique agent in that it affects the distal tubule more than the proximal. Two pathogenic\nmechanisms have been suggested to explain AKI with AmB use. The antifungal effect of AmB is related to its\nability to alter membrane permeability of fungal cells, which leads to cell death. Amphotericin B can bind to\ncholesterol molecules in cellular membranes, thereby altering membrane permeability. This effect can be toxic\nto renal tubular cells and result in ATN and tubular dysfunction. Tubular dysfunction manifests as renal tubular\nacidosis (RTA), urinary concentration defects, and electrolyte disturbances. The second mechanism for AKI is\nrenal vasoconstriction.\nChemotherapy agents\n\nCisplatin: Due to its efficacious tumoricidal activity, cisplatin is a standard component in the treatment\nregimens for various solid organ tumors. Cisplatin use can result in a variety of clinical renal syndromes\nincluding ATN, hypomagnesemia, or Fanconi syndrome. The main mechanism for causing AKI is thought to be\na direct cellular toxic injury primarily to the proximal tubule. The selective injury to proximal tubules is caused\nby preferential accumulation of the drug in proximal tubular cells. This cellular uptake happens via the copper\ntransporter-1 and organic cation transporter 2.\nIfosfamide: It is a structural isomer of cyclophosphamide and an alkylating agent that is used in the treatment\nof solid organ tumors, including those affecting children. Like cisplatin, ifosfamide also undergoes cellular\nuptake at the proximal tubule via OCT2. Once inside the cell, the drug is then metabolized into\nchloroacetaldehyde, which is chiefly responsible for cellular toxicity. Proximal tubular dysfunction resulting in\nFanconi-like syndrome is a common manifestation of ifosfamide nephrotoxicity. Tubular cell death could also\nresult in AKI. It is interesting to note that cyclophosphamide, despite its structural similarity, is not transported\nvia OCT2 and therefore is not associated with similar nephrotoxic events.\nMethotrexate (MTX): It is an antifolate agent widely used as chemotherapy against several malignancies. The\nMTX-induced AKI occurs with high-dose (1,000–33,000 mg/m2) intravenous use and results from\ncrystallization in the renal tubules, as well as direct tubular toxicity, resulting in ATN. The crystallization is\nenhanced by high urinary MTX concentration, low urine volume, and acidic urine pH. Since 90% of MTX is\ncleared by kidneys, the urine concentration of this drug closely follows its serum concentration. Preventive\nstrategies include maintaining high urine output with intravenous volume expansion and urinary alkalinization.\nOnce AKI is established, management is usually supportive. High-flux hemodialysis efficiently clears MTX,\nbut is limited by postdialysis rebound of MTX levels. Newer potential therapies include carboxypeptidase G2\n([CPDG2] glucarpidase), a recombinant bacterial enzyme that rapidly hydrolyzes MTX to inactive metabolites.\nTherapy with CPDG2 has been shown to efficiently reduce toxic MTX levels.\nPemetrexed, a structural analog of MTX, is another antifolate agent used in cancer treatment. Nephrotoxicity of\npemetrexed is mostly caused by direct tubular injury, resulting in ATN. However, nephrogenic diabetes\ninsipidus (NDI) and distal RTA has also been reported following pemetrexed use.\nTargeted chemotherapy\nAnti-angiogenic drugs, which include monoclonal antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\nand inhibitors of VEGF receptor (VEGF-R), act by disrupting tumor vascular development. Unfortunately,\nthese agents interfere with VEGF signaling in normal tissues as well, resulting in adverse renal effects. In\npodocytes, VEGF plays an important role in the maintenance of a fenestrated glomerular endothelium.\n\nDisruption of this pathway by VEGF inhibition may result in hypertension, proteinuria, and thrombotic\nmicroangiopathy.\nCetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is another drug used for\ntargeted tumor therapy. The EGFRs are also present on basolateral membrane of the distal convoluted tubule.\nActivation of these receptors stimulates magnesium reabsorption via TRPM6 channels (transient receptor\npotential cation channel, subfamily M, member 6). Thus, inhibition of EGFR in renal tissue by cetuximab can\nresult in renal magnesium wasting and hypomagnesemia.\nOther agents\nIntravenous pamidronate use has resulted in collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. On the other hand,\nintravenous zoledronate is associated with ATN.\nTacrolimus and cyclosporine are widely used calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). They are currently considered to be\nthe cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy after solid organ transplantation. Calcineurin inhibitors possess a\nvery narrow therapeutic window and are susceptible to multiple drug–drug interactions, which often lead to\ntoxic serum drug levels. Nephrotoxicity related to CNIs occurs in multiple ways. Acute toxicity is usually\nrelated to altered renal hemodynamics secondary to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. Rarely, AKI could also\nresult from thrombotic microangiopathy. Long-term CNI exposure can cause interstitial fibrosis and tubular\natrophy, leading to CKD.\nLithium has been the mainstay of treatment for patients with bipolar disorder for many years. Chronic lithium\nuse can result in various forms of nephrotoxicity. The most common renal disorder associated with chronic\nlithium use is NDI. Clinically significant NDI can occur in up to 20% of patients on lithium. The mechanism for\nlithium-induced NDI is possibly by downregulation of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) channels in the collecting duct.\nLong-term lithium therapy can also lead to CKD secondary to chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. Rarely,\nnephrotic syndrome secondary to minimal change disease or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis has been\nshown to occur after lithium therapy. Lithium use has also resulted in hypercalcemia secondary to\nhyperparathyroidism.\nProton-pump inhibitors (PPIs)\nProton-pump inhibitors are currently the mainstay of treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease. They are\ngenerally well-tolerated, but can, rarely, lead to AKI from AIN.

      "statin therapy is associated with potential risk of teratogenicity",
      "this patient has an isolated hypertriglyeridemia Answer D Lipids are insoluble in plasma, but still circulate in plasma as bound lipoproteins. Lipids serve several essential functions, including energy utilization, lipid deposition, steroid hormone production, and bile acid formation. The 5 major lipoprotein classes are: • Chylomicrons — Chylomicrons are very large particles that carry dietary lipid. • Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) — Very-low-density lipoprotein particles carry endogenous triglycerides and, to a lesser degree, cholesterol. • Intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) — Intermediate-density lipoprotein particles carry cholesterol esters and triglycerides. • Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) — Low-density lipoprotein particles carry cholesterol esters. • High-density lipoprotein (HDL) — High-density lipoprotein particles carry cholesterol esters. Dyslipidemias are disorders of lipoprotein metabolism that result in any of the following abnormalities: • High total cholesterol (TC) • High LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) • High triglycerides (TG) • Low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) The word hyperlipidemia is often used interchangeably with dyslipidemia, but does not reflect as accurately the low HDL-C level as an abnormality. A 2011 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) classification of dyslipidemia in children exists (Table 1). The categories are based on degree of abnormality, and the abnormality could be in any of the lipid subtypes. Dyslipidemia is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD), dialysis patients, and in patients with a kidney transplant. The reasons are multifactorial, including: a) genetic predisposition; b) metabolic perturbations from the primary disease itself (eg, nephrotic syndrome) or from any form of CKD; c) coexisting obesity and its own metabolic perturbations; and d) effects of immunosuppressive medications such as sirolimus on lipid metabolism. The specific perturbations seen in CKD include moderate hypertriglyceridemia, increased triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and reduced HDL are the most usual findings, whereas TC and LDL-C remain normal or modestly increased. Qualitative abnormalities in lipoproteins are common, including small dense LDL, oxidized LDL, and cholesterol-enriched TRL. Measures of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activity are reduced, and concentrations of apolipoprotein C-III are markedly elevated. Notably, some form of dyslipidemia was present in 45% of 177 children evaluated in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study. Interventions for dyslipidemia include therapeutic lifestyle interventions (dietary interventions, elimination of smoke exposure, weight loss, and increased activity) and medications. There are several choices of medications, including statins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors (eg, ezetimibe), bile acid sequestrants, fibric acid derivatives, omega-3 fatty acids, and niacin. The most recent published guidelines are the 2013 Kidney Disease Improving Global Ouctcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Lipid Management in CKD, for which the National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) has published a commentary article in 2015. In adults with CKD, statins are the first-choice therapy, not based on LDL-C elevations as in adults without kidney disease, and niacin/fibrates are recommended if the triglyceride level is extraordinarily high (above 500 mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L]). Statins are to be used with caution or not newly initiated in adults on dialysis because some (but not all) statins are renally excreted, and trials of statins in dialysis patients showed no benefit. In contrast, statins are recommended in transplant recipients with dyslipidemia, though calcienurin inhibitors (cyclosporine more so than tacrolimus) can interfere with statin metabolism and raise statin levels. In children without CKD, pharmacologic therapy is not recommended for children younger than 10 years of age unless they have a severe primary hyperlipidemia or a high-risk cardiovascular disease condition. Note that CKD is considered a high-risk cardiovascular disease condition. Pharmacologic therapy is only recommended (primarily statins) for children older than 10 years of age with milder grades of dyslipidemia who have failed lifestyle modifications for at least 6 months. In children with CKD, while the KDIGO guideline recommends against statin use, the 2015 DOQI commentary provides a more nuanced stance, allowing for certain situations where statin use may be considered. Hypertriglyceridemia is considered separate from the other dyslipidemias because it is not a cardiovascular risk factor per se and is more strongly associated with obesity. Fibrates and niacin are used for hypertriglyceridemia, though the adverse effects of niacin (eg, flushing) are significant enough to limit its widespread usage. Omega-3 fatty acids as therapy or an increase in fish oil in the diet are recommended by some authors, even though a large meta-analysis of randomized trials in adults showed no significant cardiovascular benefits of lowered triglyceride levels and 2 pediatric randomized trials showed no significant lowering of triglyceride levels. The NHLBI 2013 guidelines recommend nonpharmacologic interventions for children with elevated TG, including weight loss, a reduction of simple carbohydrate intake, and increasing dietary fish intake. In the vignette, the patient has elevated levels of TC, LDL-C, and TG, with low levels of HDL-C, a mixed dyslipidemia. Her transplant function is impaired and represents CKD. She is also at a high body mass index (not explicity stated, but inferred from high weight percentile relative to height percentile) and is on medications such as sirolimus that are known to cause dyslipidemia. Therefore, her dyslipidemia is multifactorial. Niacin is not used with low HDL-C levels. However, statins have been associated with a higher risk of congenital fetal anomalies when administered in high doses to pregnant rats. Even though a few human studies have not yet shown a similar risk, statins are still considered contraindicated in pregnancy due to the teratogenic potential. Therefore, response choice D is the preferred answer.

    "stem": "A 17-year-old adolescent girl is referred for cysts in her kidneys. She had an episode of abdominal pain, and on abdominal ultrasonography, the kidney lengths were\n10.5 cm bilaterally, with 2 cysts (0.3 cm) in the left kidney and a 0.5 cm cyst in the right kidney. Urinalysis is normal. Family history is negative for kidney disease,\nstroke, or cystic kidneys. On examination, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg with a pulse of 88 beats/min; the examination is otherwise normal. The serum\ncreatinine is 0.7 mg/dL (62 µmol/L). The family is concerned that she has autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) because they have read about it on\nthe internet.\nOf the following, the MOST accurate statement regarding the diagnosis of ADPKD in a patient with this presentation is",
    "options": [
      "based on 3 cysts present on ultrasonography before 30 years of age she has ADPKD",
      "gene sequencing will determine if she has ADPKD over 95% of the time",
      "a negative family history is present in about one-third of patients diagnosed with ADPKD",
      "the size of the kidneys and lack of family history make acquired cystic kidney disease more likely than ADPKD",
      "ultrasonography of parents would be the next best step in diagnosis Answer E Mutations in 2 genes (PKD1, on chromosome 16, and PKD2, on chromosome 4) account for most cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Typically, those with PKD1 present and progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) earlier than PKD2 (ESRD at 54 years of age for PKD1 versus 74 years of age for PKD2). Studies show that the kidneys in PKD1 are generally larger and contain more cysts than kidneys in PKD2. As a result, patients with PKD2 may have a mild, asymptomatic, and late presentation, while patients with PKD1 rarely may have hypomorphic mutations causing mild late disease. For the patient in the vignette with 3 cysts detected on ultrasonography and a negative family history of ADPKD or ESRD, an evaluation of her parents with ultrasonography would be the most efficient step in establishing a diagnosis of ADPKD. Alternatively, she may represent a “new mutation,” which is estimated to occur in less than 5% of patients. Overall, between 10% to 20% of affected patients may lack a family history of ADPKD. For patients with a family history of ADPKD (at risk), there are diagnostic criteria based on the patient’s age, number of cysts, and gene (the latter if known) (Table 1 ). Thus, if this patient had a family history of ADPKD, the finding of 3 cysts would be diagnostic. Most patients are not symptomatic until adulthood, however, about 2% of affected individuals present during childhood, sometimes in a severe neonatal presentation similar to autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. When there is no family history of ADPKD, an evaluation of the parents is important because the absence of cysts in either parent excludes inherited ADPKD if the parents are older than 40 years of age (false-negative rate less than 1% for PKD1, while for PKD2, the false-negative rate is < 1% at 30 years of age for no cysts). However, infants and older patients can still have a de novo mutation. In addition to making the diagnosis of ADPKD, these exclusion criteria are very useful in the evaluation of potential relatives of an affected patient for living donor transplant. In ADPKD, the cyst may arise in any nephron segment and vary in appearance. Thus, in a patient with cysts and a negative family history, other cystic kidney diseases should be considered (Table 2 ). A number of genetic approaches to the diagnosis of ADPKD have been developed. Linkage analysis may be performed with markers surrounding the PKD1 and PKD2 genes. In this approach, the pattern of markers (haplotype) of the patient is compared to affected and unaffected relatives. Based on the pattern of inheritance and the probability of having PKD1 versus PKD2 (overall 85% versus up to 15% for all with disease), the risk can be calculated. This approach works best with large families and usually requires 4 or more affected family members over 2 generations. For the patient in the vignette without affected family members, this approach would not be useful. Sequencing of the PKD1 and PKD2 genes may be performed and disease causing mutations can be definitively found in up to two-thirds of patients. Other mutations that are predicted to be deleterious to gene function and may cause disease (usually missense mutations) may be found in another one-fourth to one-third of patients. Often, other amino acid changes/substitutions are found, but are of uncertain significance. In a large study of 528 unrelated patients with a positive family history of ADPKD, about 90% were found to have what the authors categorized as likely, very likely, or definitive pathogenic mutations in PKD1 or PKD2. This is partially explained by the fact that about 4% of patients have rearrangements or deletions that are not detected by sequencing. Thus, in a person with a positive family history (proband genotype/mutation unknown), the negative predictive power (probability that subjects with a negative test result do not have the disease) of finding no significant mutation is approximately 91% (without considering imaging).

      "HIV-positive patients co-infected with hepatitis C virus with both end-stage liver and kidney disease are medically eligible for kidney transplant",
      "use of an HIV-positive donor’s kidney for transplant is illegal in the United States Answer C Patients with HIV are at risk for both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Causes of both include medication nephrotoxicity, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) with or without hepatitis B or C virus (HCV) co-infection, and immune complex kidney diseases. The incidence of AKI in HIV-positive patients is higher than it is in patients without HIV. The development of AKI increases the risk for morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV. The most common types of AKI in HIV-positive patients are prerenal states and acute tubular necrosis, although other etiologies may occur. As in this patient, patients with HIV infection are at risk for nephrotoxicity from antiretroviral therapy, as well as from medications used to treat opportunistic infections or hepatitis virus co-infections (Table). The prevalence and incidence of HIV-related CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are projected to increase as the prevalence of HIV infection continues to rise. The etiology of CKD in patients with HIV ranges from HIV-independent disorders (such as hypertension, diabetes, and incomplete recovery from an episode of AKI) to HIV- related disorders (such as HIVAN and HIV immune complex kidney disease [HIVICK]). In addition, many HIV-positive patients (mainly adults) are also at risk for glomerulonephritis secondary to HCV co-infection. All HIV-positive patients should be screened for proteinuria and reduced kidney function. However, as reported by Razzak Chaudhary et al, the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in a reduced incidence of and mortality in ESRD due to HIVAN, although mortality in HIVAN patients who reach ESRD remains significantly higher than other ESRD patients. Since HIVAN includes various etiologies and histology, it is challenging to summarize and assess the efficacy and safety of the available treatment options. For HIVAN, options for therapy are generally similar to that provided for patients with glomerular diseases, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), corticosteroids (CS), and calcineurin inhibitors. These medications can control proteinuria and impede progression in some patients with HIVAN, but randomized controlled trials are lacking. Treatment of HIVAN with ACEI has been shown to lengthen renal survival for up to 1.5 years compared to untreated controls, presumably through the same mechanisms as ACEI provide for other chronic glomerular diseases. There is anecdotal evidence that CS therapy may provide a modest benefit for HIVAN. Other therapies with less scientific evidence include treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and medications that block the nuclear factor kappa beta (NFkB) signaling pathway. Delay of progression of HIVAN with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) may be profound and is equal or superior to therapy with ACEI and CS. In one study of adults with HIVAN, ART therapy resulted in a 60% risk reduction for HIVAN progression to ESRD. Finally, sirolimus may be an effective therapy for HIVAN because of its ability to modulate epithelial mesenchymal transition and epithelial cell E-cadherin expression. HIV infection is no longer an absolute contraindication to transplantation. In selected cases, patients should be eligible for solid organ transplantation if they have well- controlled HIV infection. The decision to transplant a specific patient should be individualized. HIV infection is a common cause of ESRD, especially among African- Americans. Advances in antiretroviral therapy over the past decade, coupled with new insights into the biology of the virus, have served as catalysts for trials of kidney transplantation in HIV-positive individuals with well-controlled infection. The literature from the United States and Europe indicates that HIV-infected patients can be transplanted safely and enjoy post-transplant outcomes comparable to their uninfected counterparts. Growing transplant experience in the HIV-infected population has identified unique challenges, such as optimal selection of antiretroviral and immunosuppression regimens, control of viral replication, an increased risk of both acute rejection and delayed graft function (DGF), as well as inferior outcomes in recipients co-infected with HCV infection. Presently, HIV patients with untreated HCV or with end-stage liver disease are not medically eligible for kidney transplantation. Kidney transplantation in HIV-infected patients is an active area of clinical research and includes efforts to understand how HIV infects the kidneys and ways to use organs from HIV-positive individuals as a means of expanding the donor pool. Kidney transplantation in HIV-infected recipients is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for ESRD in this patient population. HIV-infected recipients are at higher risk for acute rejection than the general renal transplant population. This may be in part because drug–drug interaction between antiretroviral agents and immunosuppressive agents are complex. However, pharmacokinetic studies may help predict post-transplant immunosuppressive drug levels. HIV-infected recipients face many barriers to transplantation, and limited access to live donors and research into the use of HIV-infected donors for HIV-infected recipients may alleviate some of these disparities, and is ongoing. Until November 2013 when President Obama signed the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act into law, transplantation of HIV-positive organs was illegal in the United States under a provision of the National Organ Transplantation Act (NOTA) amendment in 1988. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act charges the US Department of Health and Human Services to establish criteria for the conduct of research in the area of HIV-positive organ transplantation; an Organ Procurement Transplantation Network work group has been established to develop policies that would permit for the safe recovery of such organs. Approximately 500 additional solid organ transplants per year would be possible if HIV-infected donors were added to the pool PREP Pearls • Kidney transplant is a viable option in HIV-infected persons whose viral counts are well contained. • Use of an organ from a HIV-infected person is no longer against the law. • Further research in this area is of great importance.

      "prostaglandin E2 Answer A The patient in this vignette presented with volume depletion from a presumed gastrointestinal illness. Laboratory evaluation revealed a high blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio, concentrated urine, and a low fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), all consistent with prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI). While several intrarenal hormonal mechanisms are brought into play in the pathophysiologic response to volume depletion, the primary mechanism that accounts for the low FENa is angiotensin II. Prerenal AKI is an appropriate functional response of structurally normal kidneys to hypoperfusion. It is the most common form of AKI encountered globally, is often community-acquired, and accounts for 40% to 55% of all cases. The oliguria in this situation represents a renal mechanism for preserving intravascular volume. Prerenal AKI is often associated with dehydration, early sepsis, or other etiologies leading to transient renal hypoperfusion. When prerenal AKI is caused by dehydration, it is usually rapidly reversed by restoration of renal perfusion. The kidneys normally receive 25% of the cardiac output, and any decrease in circulatory volume evokes a systemic response, leading to the release of potent vasoactive agents (Figure). These responses help maintain perfusion to other organs by normalizing circulatory volume and blood pressure, but at the potential expense of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). There is an intense baroreceptor-mediated activation of the sympathetic nervous system and systemic renin-angiotensin axis, with resultant afferent renal vasoconstriction mediated by angiotensin II and norepinephrine. In addition, angiotensin II promotes avid sodium and water reabsorption by the uninjured proximal tubule, as well as increased sodium reabsorption by the collecting duct, resulting in oliguria and a decreased FENa that are the hallmarks of prerenal AKI. It also stimulates the adrenal cortex, resulting in increased aldosterone secretion, which increases sodium reabsorption in distal nephron. Furthermore, the release of antidiuretic hormone in response to hypovolemia and a rise in extracellular osmolality results in enhanced water reabsorption by the intact collecting duct, which further contributes to the oliguria. The FENa is the most commonly used laboratory test to differentiate between prerenal AKI and intrinsic AKI. The FENa is calculated from measured concentrations of urinary sodium (UNa) and creatinine (UCr), and plasma sodium (PNa) and creatinine (PCr): UNa x SCr FENa, percent = ——————— x 100 SNa x UCr A FENa below 1% suggests prerenal AKI, in which the reabsorption of almost all the filtered sodium (driven primarily by angiotensin II) represents an appropriate physiologic response to decreased renal perfusion. A FENa above 2% suggests intrinsic AKI, and is indicative of tubular damage. A FENa between 1% and 2% is nondiagnostic. However, in neonates, especially preterm ones, tubular reabsorption of sodium is lower due to tubule immaturity. As a result, the FENa cutoff values separating prerenal AKI and intrinsic AKI in neonates are higher. For example, in term infants, a FENa of greater than 2.5% indicates intrinsic AKI. In premature infants of greater than 31 weeks’ gestational age, a FENa above 3% suggests intrinsic AKI, whereas in more premature infants, intrinsic AKI is characterized by a FENa of up to 6%. Limitations in the diagnostic utility of FENa include clinical situations such as previous fluid administration, diuretic therapy, and contrast administration. Other tests that have been used to distinguish between prerenal and intrinsic AKI include: • Serum blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio is markedly elevated (> 20) in patients with prerenal AKI (as in this vignette), whereas in patients with intrinsic AKI, it remains in the normal range of 10 to 15. The difference is caused by the avid urea reabsorption by the proximal tubule in prerenal AKI, which is impermeable to creatinine. • The fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) has been proposed as a more accurate determinant of prerenal AKI, especially in patients receiving diuretics. Patients with prerenal AKI generally have FEUrea below 35%, while patients with acute tubular necrosis will have FEUrea greater than 50%. The other choices in the vignette are incorrect and do not account for the low FeNa. Atrial natriuretic peptide is released by cardiac myocytes in response to atrial stretch, and has the primary actions of afferent arteriolar vasodilatation and decreased sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule and collecting duct. Intrarenal prostaglandin E2 induced by renal hypoperfusion helps maintain a normal GFR via afferent arteriolar vasodilatation. Neither erythropoietin nor epinephrine are involved in the pathophysiologic response to volume depletion. PREP Pearls • Prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI) is an appropriate functional response of structurally normal kidneys to volume depletion. • It is the most common form of AKI encountered globally, is often community-acquired, and accounts for 40-55% of all cases. • The oliguria in this situation represents a renal mechanism for preserving intravascular volume. • When prerenal AKI is caused by dehydration, it is usually rapidly reversed by restoration of renal perfusion.

      "positive immunofluorescence for immunoglobulin A Answer A The patient presents with a history and biopsy findings consistent with lupus nephritis. The finding of proliferative lesions on light microscopy as shown in Figure will lead to a classification of either class III (if <50% of glomeruli are affected) or class IV (if >50% glomeruli are affected) lupus nephritis. In the patient in the vignette, more than 50% of glomeruli had proliferative lesions, giving this patient class IV lupus nephritis. The class of lupus nephritis is the major factor that determines prognosis and treatment, and thus response choice A is the preferred answer. While the percentage of glomeruli affected in class IV lupus nephritis reflects more severe disease and potential for worse outcomes, the choices for therapy do not differ between class III and class IV lupus nephritis. In contrast, in pure class V lupus nephritis, therapy is guided by the level of serum creatinine and proteinuria (further discussed in this critique). Finally, the positive immunofluorescence for immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA), C1q, and C3 is characteristic of lupus nephritis, but does not define the treatment or prognosis. Lupus nephritis can affect all compartments of the kidney, including glomeruli, tubules, interstitium and blood vessels. The World Health Organization (WHO) initially developed the classification of lupus nephritis and it was revised by International Society of Nephrology (ISN) and the Renal Pathology Society (RPS) in 2004 (Table 1). Several guidelines have been developed for lupus nephritis. In the United States, there are guidelines published by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) for adults and by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Glomerulonephritis Work Group that addresses both children and adults. In addition, CARRA (Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance) published guidelines for proliferative pediatric lupus nephritis. While not all the guidelines agree, they all focus on treatment protocols based on the class of lupus nephritis. KDIGO recommends no specific renal treatment for class I lupus nephritis. For treatment of class II lupus nephritis, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are recommended to decrease proteinuria. If nephrotic proteinuria persists despite ACE/ARB, KDIGO indicates that other treatments, such as corticosteroids, may be used. For both class III and class IV lupus nephritis, KDIGO recommends corticosteroids plus either cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil for initial therapy. Evaluation at 3 months of serum creatinine and proteinuria is recommended to determine if the patient has responded to treatment; if worsening (eg, >25% increase in serum creatinine, worsening proteinuria) is observed after 3 months of treatment, an alternative therapy or a second biopsy is recommended. Response to therapy is generally divided into complete response (serum creatinine to baseline and a urine protein: creatinine ratio of < 0.5 mg/mg) or partial response (stable or improved serum creatinine and 50% decrease in urine protein:creatinine ratios). Treatment of class V lupus nephritis depends upon presence of abnormal renal function or nephrotic proteinuria. If the serum creatinine is normal and there is subnephrotic proteinuria, KDIGO recommends treatment with ACE/ARB and immunosuppression for extrarenal manifestations of lupus. If the serum creatinine is elevated or there is nephrotic proteinuria, corticosteroids with an additional immunosuppressive agent (cyclophosphamide, MMF, calcineurin inhibitors, or azathioprine) are recommended. Glucocorticoids may be given as intravenous pulse or as oral therapy. The CARRA consensus documents had multiple glucocorticoid regimen options, including up to 3 high dose (30 mg/kg per dose up to max 1,000 mg/dose) pulse methylprednisolone regimens due to evidence that intravenous pulse (but not oral) glucocorticoids modifies interferon-a gene expression in juvenile SLE. For class III and IV lupus nephritis, cyclophosphamide (0.5–1 g/m2) given monthly for 6 months intravenously is the National Institutes of Health protocol for induction that first demonstrated improvement in outcomes over steroids alone. CARRA recommends 0.5 g/m2 BSA as the starting dose, increasing to maximum of 1.5 g/m2 BSA. An alternative regimen of 3 months of cyclophosphamide 500 mg intravenous every 2 weeks over 3 months was as effective in a randomized trial of adult Europeans, but has not been tested as extensively in other ethnicities. Oral cyclophosphamide (eg, 1.0–1.5 mg/kg per day [maximum dose, 150 mg/d]) for 2 to 4 months is an option, but has been reported to have additional side effects. In particular, chemical cystitis was a more common complication with oral cyclophosphamide in lupus nephritis treatment trials. Patients on oral cyclophosphamide should be encouraged to drink a lot of fluids to avoid bladder toxicity. Sodium-2-mercaptoethane (mesna) is used to decreased risk of bladder toxicity in patients on intravenous cyclophosphamide. Additional risks of cyclophosphamide include infertility, alopecia, leukopenia, and secondary malignancies. Decreased dosing of cyclophosphamide is recommended for patients with decreased renal function to avoid adverse effects (by 20% with eGFR 25-50 mL/min and by 30% for eGFR 10-25 mL/min). Patients should be monitored for leukopenia 10 to 14 days after intravenous cyclophosphamide or weekly on oral cyclophosphamide. The cyclophosphamide dose should be adjusted to keep total leukocytes greater than 3,000 cells/µL. A lifetime maximum dose of 35 g cyclophosphamide is recommended to avoid secondary malignancies. For class III and IV lupus nephritis, mycophenolate (MMF) is dosed at 600 mg/m2 per dose twice daily up to a maximum of 3 g/day for up to 6 months as an alternative to cyclophosphamide. Major side effects of MMF include gastrointestinal upset and cytopenias. Complete blood cell count, liver function tests, and serum creatinine should be monitored every 2 weeks during the first month after the initiation of MMF followed by monthly testing. Maintenance therapy for lupus nephritis class III/IV includes MMF (1–2 g/d in divided doses) or azathioprine (1.5–2.5 mg/kg per d) with low-dose oral corticosteroids. Alternative therapies for lupus nephritis class III and IV include calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), azathioprine, and combinations of CNI with MMF. For patients resistant to both MMF and cyclophosphamide, rituximab and CNI have been utilized. The side effect profiles of treatment options for lupus nephritis are listed in Table 2.

      "WNK4 (With-no-lysine kinase 4) Answer C This patient presents with failure to thrive, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis with normal renal function and a low transtubular K concentration gradient (TTKG), indicating a defect in K secretion. There is high plasma renin activity and aldosterone, indicative of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1). PHA1 is caused by mutations in the aldosterone receptor (encoded by NR3C2) or by loss-of-function mutations in the ENaC channel (encoded by SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G genes). Mutations in WNK1 and WNK4 are associated with type 2 pseudohypoaldosteronism (discussed later in this critique). Mutations in SLC12A1 (which encodes the Na-K- 2Cl cotransporter) and KCNJ1 (which encodes the ROMK potassium channel) are associated with Bartter’s syndrome. To understand the molecular mechanism of these diseases, it is helpful to review potassium handling (Figure 1). Potassium absorption and secretion occurs in the distal convoluted tubule, connecting segment and cortical collecting duct. In the setting of potassium depletion, a H/K ATPase in the intercalated cell is responsible for potassium reabsorption. Potassium secretion occurs in principal and other cells of the three segments. First, K enters the cell across the basolateral membrane via the Na-K-ATPase. Increased Na-K-ATPase activity is stimulated by aldosterone. Potassium secretion occurs when K diffuses via K channels (BK and ROMK) at the apical membrane into the tubular fluid. Several factors regulate this process: reabsorption of Na via the ENaC channel (which can also be stimulated by aldosterone) generates a negative potential in the tubular lumen that favors K transport across the apical lumen. Potassium concentration and tubular flow rate also modulate the chemical potential for K efflux. Finally, the activity and number of K channels on the apical lumen are regulated by aldosterone. Pseudohypoaldosteronism is a condition in which there is resistance to aldosterone effect, leading to elevated aldosterone levels and causes hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis. The resistance to aldosterone may be either due to a defect in the aldosterone mineralocorticoid receptor or to tubular transport defects that impair the tubules’ ability to respond to aldosterone. Impaired aldosterone effects lead to impaired potassium excretion. As potassium excretion is dependent upon urine output, it is necessary to examine the transtubular K concentration gradient: TTKG = K urine / (U/P) osmolality K blood The TTKG represents the difference in the potassium concentration in the fluid in the cortical collecting tubule and the peritubular fluid in the renal cortex. The more potassium being excreted into the urine, the greater the TTKG. The normal TTKG for children is between 4.1 to 10.5 (median = 6.0), but infants have higher TTKG of 4.9 to 15.5 (mean 7.8). In the setting of hyperkalemia, a TTKG less than 4.1 or less than 4.9 in the infant indicates either aldosterone deficiency or a lack of response to aldosterone. Pseudohypoaldosteronism is classified as type 1 or type 2. PHA1 presents with salt wasting, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis with very elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone. PHA1 is divided into various different subtypes. First, there is “renal” PHA1 (Figure 2). This is the most common and is autosomal dominant, and results from mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor. Mutations are in NR3C2, which encodes for the aldosterone ligand-activated nuclear transcription factor that binds the mineralocorticoid response element in the promoter region of the target genes and induces transcription. Autosomal dominant PHA1 tends to have milder manifestations and present in later childhood. The second type is “multiple” PHA1 (Figure 2 ). This is inherited in an autosomal recessive (AR) pattern and presents in early infancy with severe salt wasting, failure to thrive, and hyperkalemia. Multiple PHA1 is caused by loss of function mutations in the alpha, beta or gamma subunits of the ENaC channel (encoded by SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G genes, respectively). AR PHA1 responds to salt supplementation but not mineralocorticoids. However, patients with AR PHA1 may have recurrent salt wasting crises, and lung infections and eczema due to impaired ENaC function in other organs. Sodium loss also occurs in the colon and can manifest as diarrhea. PHA1 can be confused with cystic fibrosis due to its lung and gastrointestinal manifestations in infancy. PHA2 (Gordon syndrome) presents with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis but with hypertension and suppressed plasma renin activity. It is caused by WNK1 and WNK4 mutations. Gain-of-function WNK4 and loss of function WNK1 mutations impair NaCl co-transporter endocytosis, leading to excessive NaCl reabsorption in the distal tubule and cortical collecting duct. This leads to impaired K and H secretion. Mutations in Kelch-like 3 (KLHL3) and Cullin3 also cause PHA2, via effects on ubiquitation of WNK1 and WNK4 (Figure 3). Recent studies have clarified the role of the two K channels in regulation of K secretion. ROMK is also known as Kir1.1 and is the product of KCNJ1 gene. ROMK’s channel properties (a high basal open probability) mean that it secretes potassium at typical physiologic membrane potentials. Mutations in ROMK are associated with Bartter’s syndrome, that present with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. With-no-lysine (WNK) kinases and a Src kinase (SGK-1) regulate ROMK endocytosis from the apical domain. WNK kinases also regulate the Na-Cl co-transporter, and mutations in WNK1 and WNK4 are associated with type 2 pseudohypoaldosteronism that presents with hypertension, hyperkalemia, and metabolic alkalosis (Figure 4). ROMK endocytosis is clathrin-mediated and ROMK has a sequence that binds the CLASP protein (that is the product of the autosomal-recessive hypercholesterolemia gene [ARH]). There are 2 isoforms of WNK1: L-WNK1 that stimulates ROMK endocytosis, and KS-WNK1 that inhibits L-WNK1. Dietary potassium loading stimulates KS-WNK1, while restriction stimulates L-WNK1. WNK4 also stimulates ROMK endocytosis and it is regulated by aldosterone-induced kinase, SGK-1. SGK-1 is a Src kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits WNK4, decreasing ROMK endocytosis. SGK-1 also mediates aldosterone effects to increased ENaC channels and the NaKATPase to enhance sodium reabsorption. BK (aka Maxi K) are large conductance voltage-and calcium-activated potassium channels, that are activated by high tubular flow rates. BK channels are encoded by 5 genes (Slo and KCNMB1-KCNMB4). While aldosterone is required for maximum kaliuresis, there are aldosterone-independent mechanisms to stimulate potassium secretion in the setting of high potassium states and of intravascular volume depletion. For example, high potassium intake stimulates BK to enter the apical lumen membranes. BK channels are only stimulated by high potassium intake and high urinary flow, and not by aldosterone. Therefore, sufficient potassium secretion can occur with high potassium intake and volume repletion. In addition, volume depletion and high aldosterone states alone do not maximally stimulate potassium secretion. Thus, loss-of-function mutations in ENaC in PHA1 result in massive sodium wasting and a loss of the negative potential that allows for potassium and hydrogen ion secretion, resulting in hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis despite elevated aldosterone levels. In PHA2, WNK1 or WNK4 mutations (or CUL3/KLHL3 mutations) lead to increased WNK1 or WNK4 mediated endocytosis of ROMK, and activation of the NaCl cotransporter. This results in excessive sodium reabsorption, hypertension, hyperkalemia, and acidosis. Since plasma volume is expanded, plasma renin activity and aldosterone are suppressed.

      "urine/serum osmolality greater than 1 after arginine vasopressin administration",
      "urine/serum osmolality less than 1 in the setting of water deprivation Answer D The posterior pituitary consists of magnocellular neurons that produce arginine vasopressin (AVP) or oxytocin. The AVP-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene comprises 3 exons. Exon 1 encodes AVP and the N-terminal region of NPII. Exon 2 encodes the central highly conserved region of the NPII peptide. Exon 3 encodes the C-terminal region of NPII and a 39 amino acid glycopeptide known as copeptin. Neurophysin serves to stabilize the hormone during its transport and storage, while recent data suggests that copeptin may play an important role in the correct structural formation of the AVP precursor as a prerequisite for its efficient proteolytic maturation. Arginine vasopressin and its protein carrier NPII are released from the posterior pituitary by calcium-dependent exocytosis when the axon is depolarized by osmoreceptor or baroreceptor stimuli. Arginine vasopressin acts on its major target organ, the kidney, where it stimulates water reabsorption and thus increases urine osmolality. It binds to the V2-receptors in the basolateral membrane of the renal collecting tubule and activates the Gs-adenyl cyclase system. This in turn activates protein kinase A, which then phosphorylates preformed aquaporin (AQP)-2 water channels localized in intracellular vesicles. Phosphorylation promotes trafficking to the apical membrane, followed by insertion of AQP2 vesicles into the cell membrane. The insertion of AQP2 into the apical membrane renders the collecting duct more water-permeable, allowing the movement of water from the lumen of the nephron into the cells of the collecting duct, thus concentrating the urine. The synthesis of AQP2 channels, as well as their movement, is regulated by AVP stimulation. Diabetes insipidus (DI) is characterized by the formation of unusually large volumes of dilute urine and a relative inability to maximally concentrate the urine. There are 2 major forms of DI. Central (neurogenic, pituitary, or neurohypophyseal) DI is caused by inadequate production and secretion of AVP, whereas nephrogenic DI features reduced ability to maximally concentrate the urine due to end-organ resistance to AVP. Patients with DI typically exhibit polyuria and polydipsia. In any patient with symptoms suggestive of DI, it is always worthwhile considering if the patient has psychogenic polydipsia, in which there is massive consumption of water, resulting in polyuria. The differential diagnosis of DI is presented in the Table . The methods of the water deprivation test must be carefully planned and monitored to minimize changes in vital signs, particularly for the development of hypotension. During testing, all water intake is stopped, and it is necessary to monitor vital signs, body weight, and urine osmolality. Once the urine osmolality stabilizes or weight changes cease, one can provide AVP and subsequently obtain urine for osmolality. In healthy subjects, withholding of water results in a dramatic rise in urine osmolality such that the urine versus serum osmolality ratio exceeds 2 and the urine osmolality peaks within 18 hours. In patients with central or nephrogenic DI, urine osmolality remains low after water deprivation and lower than the serum osmolality (ie, ratio < 1). Administration of AVP after water deprivation in patients with DI may help distinguish central versus nephrogenic DI. In central DI, AVP administration will induce a rapid and dramatic rise in urine osmolality (and a ratio of > 1 versus serum osmolality), while in nephrogenic DI, exogenous AVP will not induce a significant rise in urine osmolality. There are patients with intermediate results due to partial central or nephrogenic DI, and in patients with primary polydipsia. Though ADH levels could be measured and help to differentiate central from nephrogenic DI, commercially available assays are not very sensitive. Novel peptides such as copeptin, which is secreted stoichiometrically from the neurohypophysis along with ADH, may serve in the future as surrogate markers of ADH secretion and help differentiate central from nephrogenic DI. The patient in the vignette has hypernatremia and low urine osmolality in the setting of elevated serum osmolality. While these findings establish the diagnosis of DI, they do not help differentiate between the central and nephrogenic types. Similarly, he is likely to exhibit acute kidney injury due to obligatory water loss, but this will not distinguish between central and nephrogenic DI. Water deprivation is not indicated in this setting, as the patient already has elevated serum sodium and osmolality, and thus deprivation would prove to be dangerous. Moreover, water deprivation will not help differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI; it only helps in ruling out psychogenic polydipsia. The presence of rash and hepatosplenomegaly suggests a systemic disease such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis, wherein central DI occurs as a complication, the definite test to establish central DI would be administration of AVP. Arginine vasopressin administration in a patient with elevated serum osmolality helps differentiate central from nephrogenic DI; a patient with central DI would exhibit an increase in urine osmolality (and a decrease in the urine volume) after AVP administration, while a patient with nephrogenic DI would typically show no or a minimal increase in urine osmolality. PREP Pearls • A high-normal serum sodium concentration and higher serum osmolality (greater than 142 mEq/L [142 mmol/L], due to water loss) points toward diabetes insipidus (DI) if the urine osmolality is less than the serum osmolality. • Antidiuretic hormone administration after the patient has elevated serum osmolality helps in differentiation of central DI, where the patient would increase the urine osmolality (and decrease the urine volume), from the nephrogenic kind where there would be no to minimal increase in urine osmolality.

      "prednisolone Answer D The patient in this vignette who has returned to hemodialysis after losing his transplant appears to have erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) hyporesponsiveness, as the dosing of ESA has more than doubled over the past 2 months without the desired increase in hemoglobin. Iron deficiency (response choice D) is the best answer in this scenario because: (a) the patient is expected to have increased iron requirements with greater erythropoiesis from the increasing ESA dosing; (b) the total iron binding capacity (TIBC) level is low and the serum iron level is low-normal, both consistent with iron deficiency; and (c) the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is increased with a normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which may be seen early in iron deficiency. His other blood cell lines are normal while his parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is within the desired range, making bone marrow suppression secondary to hyperparathyroidism (response choice A) incorrect. The red blood cell indices reveal a normal MCV, so response choice C is incorrect because a high MCV is expected in folate deficiency. The patient is a candidate for having increased inflammation at baseline having advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), in addition to having a failed kidney transplant from possible chronic rejection. However, his ferritin level is not very elevated, while his C-reactive protein (CRP) is normal. Therefore, treatment focused on transplant rejection (response choice E) may not be the best choice. Additionally, his vitamin D levels are appropriate, so increasing vitamin D supplementation (response choice B) is also not indicated. Anemia is a common sequela of CKD, as erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by the type 1 interstitial cells (fibroblasts) of the renal cortex. As glomerular filtration decreases, there is decreased renal resorption of sodium in the proximal tubule and less oxygen is utilized. Subsequently, oxygen pressure in the renal tissue is increased, which is sensed by the type 1 interstitial cells and leads to their decreased production of EPO. This “deficiency” of EPO becomes more pronounced, as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases such that nearly 90% of children needing dialysis also require dosing of an ESA. The goal of ESA treatment in patients with anemia is to achieve a monthly increase of hemoglobin (Hgb) by 1 to 2 g/dL (10-20 g/L) until reaching target levels. While there is still debate whether children on dialysis have greater benefit and less overall risk with higher Hgb levels than adult patients, most guidelines (KDOQI, KDIGO) still give ranges similar to those of adults at 10 to 12 g/dL (100-120 g/L) with some minor variation. If a patient does not respond to appropriately escalated doses of ESA with improvement of Hgb values (with dosing escalation limited to no more than doubling of the initial dose by KDIGO guidelines), the patient should be considered ESA hyporesponsive, and contributing causes to this lack of responsiveness should be sought and, if possible, corrected. Table 1 includes many of the other factors that may contribute to anemia in CKD by either limiting red blood cell production (iron deficiency, inflammation, bone marrow suppression) or increasing red blood cell turnover, in addition to having insufficient EPO production. An evaluation of anemia in CKD, including dialysis, should initially start with a complete blood cell count, reticulocyte count, and iron studies, while other laboratory evaluations may be added depending on the clinical scenario. The EPO deficiency by itself typically causes a normocytic anemia with an inappropriately decreased reticulocyte count. Other contributing factors to anemia should be considered if abnormalities of the other cell lines or red blood cell indices are found. Decreased white blood cell or platelet counts should elicit inquiry as to other factors possibly contributing to depressed bone marrow function such as transient viral infections, malignancy, medication adverse effects, or an autoimmune disorder. The MCV and RDW quantify the cell volume and variation in size, respectively, and can be particularly informative. An elevated RDW, in addition to a high MCV, is suggestive of folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. Additionally, an elevated RDW is more sensitive than a low MCV for identifying early iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is common in CKD, especially after the initiation of ESA use when iron demands are increased with greater erythropoiesis. The evaluation of iron status should include a ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels. The TSAT is the measure of iron immediately available for hemoglobin synthesis as the fraction of iron bound to transferrin. It is typically expressed as a percentage and is calculated as the serum iron divided by TIBC multiplied by 100%, with a therapeutic target of greater than 20% in patients with CKD. Although it can be a highly specific predictor of iron deficiency in pediatric CKD patients, this measure has limitations. The TSAT loses its value for evaluating the availability of iron when the TIBC is low (< 200 μg/dL), as may be seen in association with poor nutrition or significant proteinuria. In the vignette, our patient has a calculated TSAT of 25%, which would seem to be adequate. However, his TIBC is low while his serum iron is low-normal, thereby giving a calculated ratio that is deceptively considered in the normal range. If the TIBC level was normal at 200 μg/dL, then the TSAT would be less than 20%. Serum ferritin reflects total iron body stores and a low serum ferritin level has been shown to be a specific predictor of iron deficiency in pediatric CKD. However, ferritin is also an acute phase reactant and may be elevated in the face of systemic inflammation or malnutrition. Therefore, ferritin may be compromised in its ability to serve as a reliable measure of iron status when its value is elevated. The target serum ferritin level in the absence of inflammation is greater than 100 ng/mL (224.7 pmol/L). The role of inflammation and its effect on anemia status has been partially clarified by the discovery of hepcidin. This hepatically-activated peptide is a key regulator of systemic iron homeostasis in patients with CKD. Hepcidin affects the turnover of the iron exporter, ferroportin, on the cell surface of enterocytes and attenuates the uptake of iron by the intestine. Its level would be decreased in patients with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia and normal renal function. Serum hepcidin levels are significantly elevated in children with CKD compared to controls and its level correlates inversely with creatinine clearance. In addition to impaired renal clearance, a major factor contributing to the elevated hepcidin level in CKD is inflammation, as inflammatory markers stimulate the liver production of hepcidin. In turn, hepcidin affects ferroportin on the cell membrane of macrophages, preventing iron release from the reticuloendothelial system and limiting iron bioavailability for utilization in red blood cells, despite the presence of sufficient body stores. Thus, hepcidin may be the key mediator in the inflammation-related, iron-restricted erythropoiesis in patients with CKD and cause “functional iron deficiency.” The distinguishing features of “absolute iron deficiency” (low serum iron levels from insufficient total body iron) from the “functional iron deficiency” of inflammation (low serum iron because it is trapped in the reticuloendothelial system) can be difficult to separate and may require deeper investigation. Some have cited using elevated ferritin levels as one way to distinguish between the two, however, there is no absolute cut-off value of ferritin that can make this distinction. A recent analysis of iron store markers in the CKiD study population actually showed that a ferritin level greater than 100 ng/mL (224.7 pmol/L) was strongly associated with a lower Hgb percentile in children not being treated for anemia. The evaluation for inflammation may include other laboratory markers such as CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or serum albumin. Additionally, treatment of “functional iron deficiency” would be to control inflammation, which may be less straightforward in some conditions. If the primary etiology of CKD is an inflammatory disease (eg, lupus nephritis), then better disease control with the use of appropriate immunosuppressants may be indicated. Likewise, in the setting of a failed renal transplant (like in this vignette), treatment of ongoing rejection may be indicated, which may potentially include performing a transplant nephrectomy. Other studies have shown that correction of vitamin D deficiency in CKD has been associated with lower hepcidin levels. Other possible contributing factors to anemia in CKD and hemodialysis include uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism, use of some medications, malnutrition, and increased dialytic clearance. Hyperparathyroidism has been shown to cause suppression of erythropoiesis by inducing bone marrow fibrosis. Dialytic removal of water-soluble vitamins (B12, folate), which are needed for DNA synthesis, or carnitine may also contribute to ESA hyporesponsiveness. Red blood cell indices that help to determine the contributing factors to anemia are detailed in Table 2 . Table 1 Table 2 PREP Pearls • Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) hyporesponsiveness should be considered in patients without an adequate increase in hemoglobin (0.5-1 g/dL [5- 10 g/L]) after doubling the dose of appropriately prescribed ESA. The main causes of ESA hyporesponsiveness in chronic kidney disease are iron deficiency, inflammation, and bone marrow suppression. • The low mean corpuscular volume of iron deficiency is not seen early in the course, though an elevated red blood cell distribution of width may. • Low serum iron values may be seen in both “absolute” and “functional” iron deficiency. Discerning between the two can be difficult, but a low ferritin (< 100 ng/mL) may be seen in the former, while a very elevated ferritin (> 500 pmol/Lng per mL) may be seen with the latter.

In the 2008 North American Pediatric Renal\nTrials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) report, more than 35% of children at the time of enrollment in the CKD\nregistry had impaired growth, which was defined as a height less than the third percentile for age and gender (Z-score\nfor height below -1.88). Overall, the mean Z-score for height was -1.44. In this cohort, the risk of growth impairment\nwas greatest (58%) in infants (younger than 1 year of age) and lowest (22%) in older children (older than 12 years of\nage). The risk for poor growth increased with decreasing renal function, although even children with mild renal\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate > 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2) were at risk for poor growth. Growth impairment\nwas greater in patients who had been on dialysis for 2 years, with a mean height Z-score of -1.6. In an analysis of\n2,000 renal transplant patients older than 19 years of age enrolled in the NAPRTCS registry, one-fourth had significant\nshort stature with a height Z-score less than -2.3, and 10% had severe growth impairment with a height Z-score less\nthan -3.3.\nGrowth impairment in children with CKD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In a study using data\nfrom the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) multivariate analysis of 1,949 children starting chronic dialysis\ntherapy, the risk of death increased by 14% for each unit of decrease of height Z-score. In another study using\nUSRDS data of 1,112 children undergoing chronic dialysis or who received a renal transplant from 1990 through 1995,\nthe risk of death increased with growth failure, with a 3-fold increase in patients with severe growth impairment\n(incremental growth < -3 standard deviations [SDS]) and a 2-fold increase in patients with moderate growth\nimpairment (> -3 and < -2 SDS). The hospitalization rate was also greater in patients with moderate and severe\ngrowth failure. Similar results were reported in a NAPRTCS study of 2,306 children initiated on chronic dialysis\nbetween 1992 and 2000. Multivariate analysis showed the risk of death was 2-fold higher in patients with heights less\nthan first percentile for age compared with patients with heights greater than or equal to the first percentile. While the\nassociation of increased mortality and short stature exists, a causal association has not been established. Children\nwith short stature also had decreased school attendance and a greater number of days of hospitalization.\nShort stature also affects the psychological development of the patient. Short children are often treated as being\nyounger than they are, and, particularly in the context of chronic illness, may be overprotected with low expectations.\nShort stature is also associated with poorer physical functioning. Survey data based on parental reports have shown\nthat catch-up growth and the use of growth hormone therapy are associated with higher physical and social\nfunctioning.\nWhile the mechanisms underlying growth impairment in children with CKD may not be completely understood, clinical\nand experimental evidence demonstrates that disturbances of growth hormone (GH) metabolism and its main\nmediator, insulin-like growth factor-1, are the primary contributing factors. Poor nutrition, metabolic acidosis, fluid\nand electrolyte abnormalities, renal osteodystrophy, and anemia are also important risk factors for growth failure in\nthese children. In patients with CKD, fasting serum GH levels are disproportionally high for the observed diminished\nlongitudinal growth, which suggests GH insensitivity. Data from the uremic rat model demonstrated a diminished\ngrowth response to recombinant GH provide additional supportive evidence of GH insensitivity in CKD.\n\nManagement to prevent and correct growth impairment caused by CKD includes supportive measures that correct\namenable complications of CKD including poor nutrition, metabolic acidosis and other electrolyte abnormalities,\nanemia, and renal osteodystrophy. However, despite these interventions, poor growth persists in a significant\nproportion of children with CKD, including those with a renal allograft. In children who have persistent growth\nimpairment, recombinant human GH therapy is an effective and well-tolerated intervention that improves\ngrowth. While the institution of recombinant human GH therapy can have a profound effect on the height\nvelocity of children with CKD who are growing poorly, early recognition and management of malnutrition,\nrenal osteodystrophy, acid-base abnormalities, and electrolyte disturbances should take place prior to\nconsidering the institution of GH therapy.\nThe patient in this vignette has long-standing, advanced CKD with a high probability of growth failure (height velocity\n< fifth percentile for age). Height velocity above the 95th percentile for age, at the 50th percentile for age, between\nthe 25th and 50th percentile for age, and between the 50th and 75th percentile for age are all not correct, as these\nare normal growth velocities.\nPREP Pearls\n Growth impairment is a common problem in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with\nsignificant morbidity and mortality.\n Clinical and experimental evidence demonstrate that disturbances of growth hormone metabolism and its\nmain mediator, insulinlike growth factor-1, are the primary contributing factors for poor growth in children\nwith CKD.\n Poor nutrition, metabolic acidosis, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, renal osteodystrophy, and anemia are\nalso important risk factors for growth failure.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Recognize the effect of chronic kidney disease on linear growth of children\nSuggested Readings\n International Society of Nephrology.

Cystinuria is a disorder of amino acid transport in both\nrenal proximal tubule and intestinal tract, causing excessive excretion of cystine and other dibasic amino acids lysine,\nornithine, and arginine.\nThe first report of cystine stones dates back to 1810, but it was more than a century later when the pathophysiology\nof cystinuria was first elucidated. Defective renal tubular reabsorption of filtered cystine by the apical cell membranes\nof the renal proximal tubule results in accumulation of l-cystine in urine. In the intestine, there is also a defect of the\napical membrane absorptive process. However, it is compensated by another apical membrane transporter, solute\ncarrier family 15 member 1 (PEPT1), which allows absorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids from the gut lumen.\nThe presence of PEPT1 in the intestine and its absence in the kidneys explains the urinary hyperexcretion of cystine in\ncystinuria without any gastrointestinal symptoms. The defective transport process in the kidney also leads to\nincreased urinary excretion of 3 other dibasic amino acids: lysine, arginine, and ornithine. Although their urinary\nconcentrations are concurrently increased in cystinuria, they are very soluble at the typical urinary pH of 5 to 7, and\ndo not contribute to nephrolithiasis. Cystine, however, has very low solubility in acidic urine, which leads to\nsubsequent crystallization and stone formation.\nMutations in 2 genes underlie the genetic basis of cystinuria: SLC3A1 on chromosome 2p encodes the neutral and\nbasic amino acid transport protein (rBAT), and SLC7A9 on chromosome 19q encodes the amino acid transporter 1\n(b0,+). Both of these proteins are responsible for reabsorption and absorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids at\nthe apical membranes of the proximal renal tubule and small intestine. Defective production of either leads to the\nphenotype of cystinuria. Mutations in SLC3A1 produce a disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance; heterozygotes\nhave normal urinary cystine excretion. Mutations in SLC7A9 produce an autosomal dominant disorder with variable\npenetrance; heterozygotes have abnormal urinary cystine excretion constituting enough to sometimes form stones\n(Table 1).\nTable.

Springer-Verlag, 2019; pg 902\nHowever, there is no clinical difference between the 2 groups in their disease in terms of onset of illness, stone\nformation, aggressiveness of disease, or a potential need for surgical intervention for stone removal.\nThe presence of hexagonal crystal, as described in the vignette, is diagnostic of cystinuria. A 24-hour quantitative\nurine evaluation that shows more than 300 to 400 mg/L of cystine excretion (normal 30 mg/L or < 100 µmmol/g of\ncreatinine, < 18 mg/g of creatinine) also helps in diagnosing cystinuria. Sending a spot urine cystine (which can be\nobtained through urine amino acid quantification) to creatinine ratio may be helpful, but is not ideal, as urinary cystine\n\nsaturation changes throughout the day with regard to urine pH, urinary concentration, and volume. However, because\nof the tubular immaturity, even heterozygotes can have increased excretion until 3 to 4 years of age. Therefore, one\nneeds to wait until such time to classify the final cystinuria phenotype.\nIn intestinal and proximal kidney tubule epithelia, specific amino acid transporters, located on both the luminal and\nbasolateral membranes, together perform an “uphill” transcellular transport, that is, against the concentration\ngradient back into the extracellular blood compartment. This net transport is very efficient, and in the renal proximal\ntubule up to 99% of free amino acids, filtered through the glomerulus, are reabsorbed, and thus retained by the\norganism. Of the choices in the vignette, accumulation of cystine in urine alone causes nephrolithiasis, while excretion\nof neutral (alanine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan), iminoacids (proline, hydroxyproline), glycine, or dicarboxylic\namino acids (glutamate, aspartate) do not lead to nephrolithiasis.;\nPREP Pearls\n The defective transport process in the kidney leads to increased urinary excretion of three dibasic amino\nacids: lysine, arginine, and ornithine.

However, these agents can cause renal\nscarring over time, with hyaline arteriosclerosis being a typical though not specific feature on biopsy, related to\nchronic afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. Calcineurin inhibitors also cause hypertension. Within the CNI group,\ncyclosporine A is associated with a higher risk of facial hirsutism, while tacrolimus is associated with a higher risk of\ndiabetes mellitus and neurotoxicity, especially tremors.\nAntimetabolite drugs include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and mycophenolate sodium.

These agents are not considered intrinsically nephrotoxic\nthemselves, though they associate with a higher incidence of proteinuria.

    "explanation": "C. she may have thin basement membrane disease or Alport syndrome, and has a risk of end-stage renal disease\nThe finding of thin glomerular basement membranes with a lack of other glomerular pathology on renal biopsy\nis the primary finding in thin glomerular basement membrane disease or nephropathy (TBMN). The thinning is\nuniform and mostly in the lamina densa component of the basement membrane. Normal glomerular basement\nthickness varies by age, sex, and laboratory technique, and thin basement membrane disease may be diagnosed\nwith a thickness of about less than two-thirds of normal. Diffuse thin basement membranes may also be present\nin the early stages of Alport syndrome. Focal basement membrane thinning may be seen in some normal\nchildren and in patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome.\nThin basement membrane nephropathy presents with asymptomatic microhematuria in the absence of\nhypertension or proteinuria. The hematuria is usually persistent, but in some patients, may be intermittent or\nabsent. In some patients, macroscopic hematuria may also occur, but would be more typical of immunoglobulin\nA nephropathy or Alport syndrome. The presence of hematuria with proteinuria, renal impairment, or\nhypertension would warrant a workup including consideration of renal biopsy.\nThe exact epidemiology of TBMN is difficult to ascertain because the diagnosis is often established based on\nthe presence of persistent hematuria with minimal or no proteinuria, often without histological confirmation.\nThis has led some investigators to derive the incidence of TBMN from the prevalence of persistent hematuria\namong entire populations. Most screening studies reveal that about 1% to 2% of children have persistent\nmicroscopic hematuria and TBMN is thought to be the most common genetic cause of persistent microscopic\nhematuria in children, perhaps accounting for one-third to one-half of the persistent microscopic hematuria.\nThin basement membrane nephropathy has been reported in children as young as 1 year of age. There is\nconflicting evidence regarding male or female predisposition; if anything, TBMN may be slightly more\nprevalent in females. Overall, the prevalence of TBMN in children is approximately 1%, but may be slightly\nhigher. It should be noted that some patients with TBMN do not have persistent microscopic hematuria, but\nrather intermittent hematuria.\nThe common glomerular causes of persistent, isolated, microscopic hematuria include immunoglobulin A\nnephropathy (IgAN), TBMN, and Alport syndrome. Obtaining a detailed family history may provide clues to\nthe etiology of microscopic hematuria. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is usually sporadic, with only 5% to\n10% of cases showing an autosomal dominant inheritance. Female carriers of Alport syndrome usually have\npersistent hematuria (95%), but a family history of deafness, lenticonus, or retinal disease would suggest Alport\nsyndrome rather than TBMN or IgAN. In TBMN, a positive family history may be absent because of de novo\nmutations, incomplete penetrance, or lack of diagnosis in family members (never checked or not told they had\nhematuria).\n\nDeafness may also be seen in diseases associated with the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA protein. These\ndiseases (Fechtner, Sebastian, and Epstein syndromes, and the May-Hegglin anomaly) are autosomal dominant\nsyndromes associated with large platelets. They show hematuria and proteinuria, with progression to end-stage\nkidney disease in adolescence to young adulthood. Biopsy is usually avoided because of bleeding risk, but may\nshow thickening and splitting of the basement membranes.\nThere is considerable overlap in TBMN and Alport syndrome, and both are caused by mutations in type IV\ncollagen (COL4) trimer proteins (α3 [A3], α4 [A4], α5 [A5]).\nIn X-linked Alport syndrome, the COL4A5 gene is mutated and affected males present with hematuria and\nprogress to renal failure as adolescents. Female carriers of COL4A5 usually have a benign course resembling\nTBMN, but it is now known that about 20% of female carriers of a COL4A5 mutation may develop renal failure\nby the sixth decade of life. A number of hypomorphic mutations in COL4A5 have been reported to cause a\nTBMN phenotype with delayed or absent progression of kidney disease or deafness.\nCOL4A3 and COL4A4 are associated with both TBMN and Alport syndrome. Thin basement membrane\nnephropathy is usually associated with heterozygous mutations in COL4A3 or COL4A4. When these\nheterozygous mutations are present in both copies of a component of the collagen trimer, autosomal recessive\nAlport syndrome may occur. Patients with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (male and female) have a\ncourse similar to males with X-linked Alport syndrome, including the extrarenal manifestations.\nAlternatively, there are families with autosomal dominant Alport syndrome with a single mutation in COL4A3\nor COL4A4. These patients may have an aggressive course or mild presentation depending on the mutation.\nInterestingly, large scale studies out of Cyprus describe TBMN and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\nassociated with heterozygous mutations in COL4A3 or COL4A4 with late progression (after fourth decade) in a\nnumber of families.\nFor the patient in the vignette, an assessment of her mother’s status should have been performed and likely\nwould have been more informative than the renal biopsy. If her mother had hematuria and proteinuria, she may\nbe a carrier of a COL4A5 (ie, Alport syndrome) mutation or COL4A3 and COL4A4 mutations that lead to\nhematuria, proteinuria, and renal disease progression (autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant Alport\nsyndrome), whereas isolated hematuria would have supported TBMN. Recent expert guidelines suggest\nperforming genetic testing in males with suspected TBMN to rule out a pathologic COL4A5 mutation (X-linked\nAlport syndrome) rather than the more difficult analysis (due to benign versus pathologic variants) of COL4A3\nand COL4A4 sequences.\nLong term follow-up is essential for all with a clinical or biopsy diagnosis of TBMN because some patients will\ndevelop proteinuria, hypertension, or renal impairment. In one series, 4 of 22 patients showed a decline in renal\n\nfunction over about a decade, although caution regarding the validity of all studies should be considered\nbecause some patients with Alport syndrome are misdiagnosed with TBMN.\nPREP Pearls\n Patients with isolated hematuria require long term follow-up.\n Renal biopsy findings of thin basement membranes may represent early Alports syndrome.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the natural history and epidemiology of thin basement membrane disease\nSuggested Readings\n Carasi C, Van't Hoff WG, Rees L, Risdon RA, Trompeter RS, Dillon MJ.

    "explanation": "B. distal renal tubular acidosis\nThe hypokalemia and hyperchloremia with normal anion gap metabolic acidosis suggest either lower\ngastrointestinal or renal losses of potassium and bicarbonate. The absence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the\nelevated urine pH in the face of acidosis indicate renal bicarbonate wasting, making renal tubular acidosis\n(RTA) the most likely diagnosis. Hypokalemia is mostly seen in type 1(distal) RTA, but may be present in type\nII (proximal) RTA, particularly after the initiation of bicarbonate therapy. Nephrolithiasis is a common\ncomplication of distal RTA and is almost never seen in proximal RTA, making distal RTA the most likely\ndiagnosis. Proximal RTA may have an acidic urine pH, while the urine pH in distal RTA is inappropriately\nelevated as in this patient.\nDistal RTA may be inherited or may occur as a complication of autoimmune disorders (Sjögren syndrome and\nlupus), hyperparathyroidism, rejection of a transplanted kidney, renal medullary cystic disease, obstructive\nuropathy, and chronic urinary tract infections. Proximal RTA in children may occur as part of Fanconi\nsyndrome, which is also associated with glycosuria, aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, and uricosuria. Proximal RTA\ncan result from inherited disorders such as galactosemia, fructosemia, cystinosis, Lowe syndrome, Dent disease,\nmitochondrial myopathy, and Wilson disease. It can also be secondary to medications that cause proximal\ntubular damage and included are heavy metals, chemotherapeutic agents such as ifosfamide, cisplatin,\naminoglycoside antibiotics, and other medications including acetazolamide and topiramate. In adults, proximal\nRTA may complicate diseases such as multiple myeloma.\nA decrease in potassium intake is an uncommon cause of potassium depletion and hypokalemia, but may\ncontribute when renal or gastrointestinal losses are excessive. Decreased intake alone is unlikely to cause\nhypokalemia in healthy children. Of note, prolonged decreased intake (eg, malnutrition or anorexia) in\ncombination with increased potassium losses via the kidney or gastrointestinal tract can lead to significant total\nbody potassium depletion.\nThe normal distribution of potassium between cells and the extracellular fluid is predominantly preserved by\nNa-K-ATPase pumps in cell membranes. Increased activity of the Na-K-ATPase pump or alterations in other\npotassium transport pathways can result in transient hypokalemia caused by increased potassium entry into cells\nfrom the extracellular space. This can be seen in respiratory or metabolic alkalosis when intracellular potassium\nmovement is promoted to maintain electroneutrality as hydrogen ions exit the cell in response to the increase in\nextracellular pH. In children with metabolic alkalosis, there is also an increased loss of urinary potassium\nsecondary to increased distal tubular delivery of sodium bicarbonate as the proximal reabsorption threshold is\nexceeded. In the distal tubule, the sodium is exchanged for potassium, resulting in increased loss of potassium\n\nin the urine. Increased insulin activity also promotes intracellular potassium movement by increasing the\nactivity of the Na-K-ATPase pump.\nImportantly, hypokalemia may be seen because of insulin-mediated potassium transcellular movements in the\nrefeeding syndrome after prolonged starvation, or in children and adolescents with eating disorders (Table).\nTable.

Meyers\nElevated β-adrenergic activity promotes intracellular movement of potassium by increasing Na-K-ATPase\npump activity. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is caused by defects in muscle calcium and sodium channels. It\nis a rare neuromuscular condition that presents with sudden episodes of severe muscle weakness associated with\nhypokalemia. The potassium level can drop rapidly to less than 2 mEq/L (2 mmol/L) and give rise to symptoms\nof weakness and inability to move. Symptoms are triggered by exercise, stress, and high carbohydrate meals.\n\nPrimary cases are most often caused by mutations in the gene that codes for the α-1 subunit of the\ndihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel in skeletal muscle. Acquired cases occur in patients with\nhyperthyroidism. Other drugs associated with causing hypokalemia include barium (by blockade of potassium\nchannels limiting their efflux from cells), cesium, risperidone, quetiapine, and chloroquine intoxication\n(intracellular movement of potassium).\nGastrointestinal potassium losses are usually associated with diarrhea, but may also be increased in the absence\nof overt diarrhea (for example with laxative abuse or villous adenoma). Hypokalemia and hyperchloremic\nmetabolic acidosis are typical of lower gastrointestinal potassium losses or RTA.\nThe major cause of renal potassium wasting is enhanced distal tubular potassium secretion, which may occur\nbecause of steroid excess (eg, primary hyperaldosteronism), loop and thiazide diuretics, osmotic diuresis (eg,\nuncontrolled diabetes mellitus), upper gastrointestinal losses (vomiting or nasogastric drainage), and\nhypomagnesemia. Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism generally have hypertension; the blood pressure is\nusually normal in other causes of renal potassium wasting. Hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis suggest steroid\nexcess, diuretics, vomiting, or Bartter and Gitelman syndromes.\nRenal potassium excretion is through secretion of potassium into the distal nephron by the principal cells in the\nconnecting tubule and cortical collecting tubule. In the distal tubule, sodium is reabsorbed under the influence\nof mineralocorticoids (primarily aldosterone) and potassium is exchanged to preserve electroneutrality.\nIncreased urinary potassium loss occurs when there is increased delivery of sodium and water to the distal\ntubule and collecting duct or when there is increased mineralocorticoid activity. Diuretic therapy, osmotic\ndiuresis, Bartter and Gitelman syndromes, tubular injury due to interstitial nephritis or cisplatin-prolonged\nadministration (several days), or a large amount of intravenous fluid with no potassium supplementation are all\nassociated with urinary potassium losses leading to lower serum potassium as a result of increased distal\ndelivery of sodium. Increased mineralocorticoid activity enhances potassium urinary excretion. In children, the\nmost common cause of increased mineralocorticoid activity is due to secretion of aldosterone\n(hyperaldosteronism) caused by volume depletion. Other causes of increased mineralocorticoid activity in\nchildren are less common and include aldosterone-secreting adenomas, glucocorticoid remediable\naldosteronism, apparent mineralocorticoid excess, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) caused by 17-α-\nhydroxylase deficiency, the latter which presents with hypertension, hypokalemia, and hypogonadism at\npuberty, and 11-β-hydroxylase deficiency, which presents in neonates with virilization, hypertension, and\nhypokalemia. Other causes of urinary loss of potassium in children include:\n Amphotericin B nephrotoxicity causes hypokalemia by disrupting cellular membranes and increasing membrane\npermeability\n Liddle syndrome that may present in childhood as hereditary hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and hypertension\n Cystic fibrosis and skin losses in children often younger than 2.5 years of age with volume depletion\n\nUrinary chloride excretion is helpful in the differential diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis with or without\nhypokalemia. A urinary chloride level less than 25 mEq/day suggests upper gastrointestinal losses or remote\ndiuretic use, whereas a urinary chloride greater than 40 mEq/day suggests a renal cause for potassium loss\n(current diuretic use, steroid excess, or ion transporter tubulopathy). Surreptitious diuretic abuse or vomiting\nshould always be considered in normotensive adolescents with unexplained hypokalemia and metabolic\nalkalosis; younger children are more likely to have a genetic cause for the renal tubular potassium loss.\nHypokalemia and hypomagnesemia commonly coexist and renal potassium wasting cannot be corrected until\nMg stores are repleted, therefore the serum Mg concentration should always be checked in children with\notherwise unexplained hypokalemia.\nPREP Pearls\n There are numerous causes of hypokalemia.\n Hypokalemia is caused by inadequate intake, loss from the body, or potassium shift.\n Numerous medications affect the serum potassium concentration.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the causes of hypokalemia\nSuggested Readings\n Clayton JA, Rodgers S, Blakey J, Avery A, Hall IP.

    "explanation": "A. initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy will facilitate nutritional support\nThe patient in the vignette presents with sepsis syndrome and oliguric acute kidney injury.\nChildren with acute kidney injury (AKI) are often in a high catabolic state with increased energy needs. If these needs are not met,\nmalnutrition can develop rapidly and may impair renal recovery. In 1 study, 30% of children with AKI (not requiring dialysis) became\nacutely malnourished. The more severe the AKI, the less likely the children were to receive sufficient protein and caloric intake.\nPatients with AKI who are malnourished have higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Thus, management of AKI includes optimization of\nnutrition. Historically, protein was restricted in AKI to delay need for dialysis. However, a positive nitrogen balance has been associated\nwith increased rates of survival. Nutritional support can prevent protein-energy wasting, preserves lean body mass, and improves\nwound healing and immune function. The ability to support nutrition in the critically ill patient is now considered one of the indications for\ncontinuous renal replacement therapy, and thus response choice A is the preferred answer.\nKidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) nutritional guidelines for AKI are available (see\nhttp://www.kdigo.org/clinical_practice_guidelines/pdf/KDIGO%20AKI%20Guideline.pdf ).\nFor adults, the recommendation is 20 to 30 kcal/kg per day for any stage of AKI. Calories can be provided by carbohydrates, fat, and\nprotein. KDIGO recommends calories in AKI be provided as: 3 to 5 (maximum 7) g per kg of carbohydrates and 0.8 to 1.0 g per kg of\nfat. Monitoring for complications of nutrition administration in critically ill patients, including hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, is\nindicated. The recommendations suggest differing levels of protein administration based on degree of AKI:\n 0.8 to 1.0 g/kg per day of protein in noncatabolic AKI patients without need for dialysis\n 1.0 to 1.5 g/kg per day in patients with AKI on renal replacement therapy\n Up to a maximum of 1.7 g/kg per day in patients on continuous renal replacement therapy\n(CRRT; this is because 0.2 g of amino acids are lost per liter of filtrate in CRRT) and in hypercatabolic patients\nKDIGO also has recommendations for nutritional support in pediatric AKI. In general, it is recommended that children receive 100% to\n130% of the basal energy expenditure, which can be estimated by the Caldwell-Kennedy equation:\nresting energy expenditure [kcal/kg/d] = 22 + 31.05 * weight [kg] + 1.16 * age [years]\nThere are less specific recommendations for protein requirements in children with AKI. In general, protein requirements vary by age for\ncritically ill children, age related recommendations (in those without AKI are:\nAge 0-2 years 2 to 3g/kg per day\nAge 2-13 years 1.5 to 2 g/kg per day\nAge 13-18 years 1.5 g/kg per day\nStudies of critically ill children with AKI indicate that typical protein intake averages 2.4 g/kg per day for children younger than 1 year of\nage, 1.9 g/kg per day for children 1 to 13 years of age, and 1.3 g/kg per day for children 13 to 18 years of age.\nEnteral (oral or by tube) feeding is preferred. Renal formulas, such as Similac® PM 60/40 and Suplena®, which are low in potassium\nand phosphorus, may be needed to avoid hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia, especially in patients not on dialysis. If enteral\nfeeding is not an option, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be utilized.\nResponse choice B is not correct because serum albumin may be altered by numerous factors other than nutrition in the critically ill\npatient. Even in the setting of end-stage renal disease, the utility of using serum albumin as a marker of nutritional status is\ncontroversial. Response choice C is not correct as protein restriction is not recommended in the setting of AKI. Response choice D is\n\nnot correct as dextrose administration is not restricted for risk of infection.

The\nassociation of elevated uric acid, gout, and kidney disease suggests that the patient likely has familial hyperuricemic nephropathy that\ninvolves the uromodulin gene, which is now been associated with medullary cystic kidney disease.\nThe terminology of medullary cystic kidney disease has been used to describe clinicopathological disease entity characterized by\nautosomal dominant inheritance, and leads to chronic kidney disease in adults caused by chronic sclerosing tubulointerstitial\nnephropathy.\nTraditionally, medullary cystic kidney disease has been classified as type 1 and type 2. Type 1 disease has been characterized in\nadults with a median age of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at 54 years, though a younger age of ESRD at 32 years has been\ndescribed in another kindred. Type 1 disease has been mapped to chromosome 1q21-23. The genetic cause of medullary cystic kidney\ndisease type 1 was recently identified as a cytosine insertion in the variable number of tandem repeat region of encoding mucoprotein-1\n(MUC1). Type 2 has been described with an earlier age of onset of hyperuricemia, while ESRD occurs at 16 to 54 years of age.\nLinkage analysis showed type 2 disease mapped to chromosome 16p11-13, which has been further characterized to involve mutations\nin the uromodulin gene. This encodes Tamm-Horsfall protein, which is expressed primarily in thick ascending limb of loop of Henle\n(Table 1).\nTable 1.

Srivaths\nIt is important to note that neither tubular cysts or its medullary location detected by either clinical imaging or pathology are\npathognomonic for these diseases. Thus, the nomenclature seems to be very misleading. Other entities may also cause hyperuricemia\nand tubulointerstitial nephropathy and have an autosomal dominant inheritance. One prominent example would be hepatocyte nuclear\nfactor (HNF) mutations causing nephropathy. Though classically described to have diabetes and renal cysts, a large number of patients\nwith HNF1B mutations display hyperuricemia, and some present with early onset gout. Importantly, for this reason, some patients\nwith HNF1B mutations would meet the diagnostic criteria for familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. As described earlier, the latter\ncondition is caused by mutations in the UMOD gene, which encodes uromodulin and is suggested to play a role in renal urate\ntransport. HNF1B knockout mice also showed reduced UMOD expression, suggesting that HNF1β regulates transcription of UMOD.\nAnother entity involves renin mutations which leads to familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy type 2 (FJHN2). This disease is\ncharacterized by hypoproliferative anemia with low hemoglobin concentrations found in most affected children by 1 year of age,\nhyperuricemia and gout found in most (not all) affected individuals, and slowly progressive chronic tubulointerstitial kidney disease then\ndevelops. Some affected children have polyuria and enuresis. Mildly elevated serum creatinine concentration and reduced estimated\nglomerular filtration rate in an asymptomatic child often progresses to ESRD in the fourth to sixth decades of life.\n\nThis expanding group of diseases has led a new terminology proposed from a consensus conference hosted by Kidney Disease:\nImproving Global Outcomes\n(KDIGO) called autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD), which will comprise of the entities listed in Table 2.\nTable 2.

    "stem": "You are evaluating a 11-year-old girl with a new diagnosis of hypertension. She was first found to have elevated blood pressure (BP) when she presented to her\nprimary care provider (PCP) for a well child visit 3 months earlier. Blood pressure at that time was noted to be 136/76 mm Hg. Her PCP has repeated her BP on several\noccasions by manual auscultation and these BPs have been consistently in the 120s/80s mm Hg range. She is asymptomatic, specifically not complaining of headache,\nchest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, and dizziness. Past medical history, including her birth history, is unremarkable. She is not taking any medications.\nVitals and anthropometrics reveal a weight of 80 kg (greater than 99th percentile), height of 150 cm (90%), and body mass index of 35.6 kg/m2 (greater than 99th\npercentile). Blood pressure readings were 129/70 mm Hg, 127/75 mm Hg, and 124/72 mm Hg (average of 3, 127/74 mm Hg). The 90th percentile BP for her age, sex,\nand height is 119/77 mm Hg, the 95th percentile is 123/81 mm Hg, and the 99th percentile is 130/88 mm Hg. Physical examination is only notable for obesity and\nacanthosis nigricans.\nHer PCP initiated a workup that has not revealed a secondary cause of hypertension. She has normal electrolytes, normal kidney function, a normal urinalysis and a\nnormal renal ultrasound. Laboratory results are only notable for hemoglobin A1c of 6.2%. Echocardiogram reveals concentric remodeling.\nOf the following, the MOST appropriate next step in your management of this girl is",
    "options": [
      "evaluate for presence of obstructive sleep apnea",
      "initiate antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy",
      "magnetic resonance angiography to evaluate for renal artery stenosis",
      "plasma and urine catecholamines to evaluate for a pheochromocytoma",
      "plasma renin determination to screen for mineralocorticoid disease Answer A Hypertension is defined as the sustained elevation in blood pressure (BP) at or above the 95th percentile for a child’s age, sex, and height percentile. Once hypertension is diagnosed in a child or adolescent, they should undergo a workup to evaluate for a secondary cause of their hypertension and to investigate for comorbidities. All children meeting criteria for a diagnosis of hypertension should have the following laboratory and imaging studies conducted: electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count, fasting lipid panel, fasting glucose, renal and bladder ultrasonography, and echocardiography. If no secondary etiology is identified with this workup, additional testing may be warranted to complete your evaluation. Young children and individuals with significantly elevated BP should undergo additional workup, as a secondary cause for hypertension is more likely in that subset of children. However, older children and those with BP just at or slightly above the 95th percentile do not necessarily require further workup if they do not have any suggestive history or physical examination findings. These children and adolescents may be diagnosed with primary hypertension; those with obesity may be diagnosed with obesity-related primary hypertension. The child in this vignette is a pre-adolescent with stage I hypertension and a negative workup. She is asymptomatic, but has evidence of insulin resistance with an elevated hemoglobin A1c and acanthosis nigricans on examination. Her body mass index percentile classifies her as obese. Given her age, degree of BP elevation, and lack of symptoms, it would be appropriate to diagnose her with obesity-related primary hypertension. Children with obesity-related hypertension should be assessed for the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), initially using detailed questioning to inquire about symptoms such as loud snoring, witnessed apneic periods, and daytime somnolence. If no concerns for OSA exist with this questioning, no additional evaluation may be necessary. However, if concerns arise, polysomnography may be warranted. Indeed, a major cause of resistant hypertension is OSA, and effective treatment can effectively lower BP by as much as 10 mm Hg systolic and 5mm Hg diastolic. With 60% of obese children and adolescents having OSA, this is a worthwhile screen for hypertensive children. Obesity impacts the cardiovascular disease risk of children: obese children are more likely to be hypertensive, have dyslipidemia, be insulin-resistant, and manifest abnormalities of their cardiovascular system such as abnormal cardiac remodeling (left ventricular hypertrophy) and atherosclerosis (measured as increased carotid intimal media thickness). In fact, 30% of obese children are hypertensive, whereas the prevalence of hypertension among all children is much less, estimated to be between 3% and 5%. Obesity contributes to the development of elevated blood pressure and eventual hypertension via several mechanisms. In the obese state, there is abundant adipose tissue that is composed of adipocytes, which are active endocrine cells as well as sites for energy storage, macrophages, fibroblasts, and T cells. With obesity, the adipose tissue becomes dysfunctional, leading to a pro-inflammatory state. This metabolic dysfunction results in adiponectin deficiency, elevated free fatty acids, increased adipokine secretion, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, sympathetic nervous system activation, and oxidative stress, which leads to endothelial dysfunction, impaired pressure natriuresis, vascular hypertrophy, and ultimately hypertension. Almost all components of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system are elevated in the obese state and all decrease with weight loss. Similarly, obesity increases sympathetic nervous system activity and weight loss decreases it. The importance of the sympathetic nervous system in obesity hypertension was nicely demonstrated in animal studies involving dogs. When fed a high-fat diet, dogs with bilaterally denervated kidneys and controls demonstrated the same weight gain, but only the dogs with intact renal innervation manifested elevated BP and lower renal sodium excretion. In addition, another mechanism by which obesity is postulated to cause hypertension is via fat encapsulation of the kidney. Like other visceral organs, the kidney can experience this consequence of obesity. When surrounded by fatty tissue, the kidney can encounter increased interstitial fluid pressure and slower tubular flow rates, leading to increased sodium and water reabsorption. The pathophysiology of obesity-related hypertension means that the mainstay of therapy remains weight loss and adherence to a heart-healthy lifestyle. Weight loss not only addresses the underlying cause of their hypertension, but it improves comorbidities and decreases sympathetic nervous system activation. Individuals should be counseled on implementing the Cardiovascular Health Integrated Lifestyle diet (CHILD-1) and DASH eating plan:  Increased intake of fresh vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy  Reduce carbohydrate, fat, and processed sugar intake  Limit/avoid sugar-sweetened beverages  Encourage foods with high dietary fiber content (age + 5 = number of grams/day) They should also aim to get 1 hour of activity daily. The intensity of this daily activity should be at least moderate on 4 days of the week and vigorous on the other 3 days of the week. Regarding the other choices provided for the child in the vignette, pharmacological antihypertensive therapy is not warranted at this time, as she has asymptomatic, primary stage I hypertension, no end-organ damage (concentric remodeling is abnormal left ventricular geometry with normal left ventricular mass index), and does not have diabetes. She should be prescribed weight loss and therapeutic lifestyle changes. If her BP is not improved with this nonpharmacological approach over the following 6 to 12 months, an antihypertensive medication should be prescribed at that time. Since her BP is not severely elevated and she does not have any noted renal size discrepancy on ultrasonography or bruit noted on examination, pursuing a workup for renal artery stenosis would not be the best next step. However, if she were to develop resistant or escalating hypertension, a workup for renal artery stenosis could be readdressed at that time. Additionally, she does not have any symptoms to suggest a pheochromocytoma or laboratory findings/family history concerning for mineralocorticoid disease. Therefore, testing for those entities would not be warranted at this time. PREP Pearls  Obesity increases cardiovascular risk in children: obese children are more likely to be hypertensive, dyslipidemia, insulin resistant, and are more likely to develop left ventricular hypertrophy and atherosclerosis.  Obesity contributes to the development of hypertension via dysfunctional adipose tissue that leads to a proinflammatory state.  Weight loss and maintenance of a heart healthy lifestyle remains the mainstay of therapy for obesity-related hypertension.

      "deceased donor source kidney transplants continue to have less than 60% 7-year allograft survival",
      "a living donor who passes the evaluation now will still be usable 10 years later",
      "sensitization from the first kidney transplant will prevent the subsequent receipt of a deceased donor transplant",
      "a zero antigen mismatch deceased donor kidney has inferior long-term graft survival to a zero match living unrelated donor kidney Answer D Survival after kidney transplantation in children has improved considerably over the last 3 decades. According to the 2010 transplant report of the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS), short-term survival is excellent and, in particular, has improved for deceased donor source transplants (Figure). The 7-year allograft survival of living donor source transplants is approximately 80%, and of deceased donor source transplants is approximately 70%. In the past, deceased donor source transplants had a 16-point inferior 7-year allograft survival compared to a living donor source, but this gap has narrowed. Nevertheless, a kidney transplant currently cannot be expected to last the length of time to take a child to a long life expectancy. Therefore, all parents are faced with the issue of likely multiple kidney transplants in the life of their child. Assuming that both choices are feasible and available for the first transplant, the choice of deceased donor first versus living donor first is associated with multiple advantages and disadvantages on both sides (Table). After transplant listing, deceased donor wait times for children who are not sensitized are generally not long. This is because allocation schemes for deceased donor listing in the United States have always favored children. So, a child could expect to receive a deceased donor kidney reasonably fast. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch of a deceased donor kidney could range from a highly desirable 0 to a less desirable 6, though minor antigens would likely be mismatched. A deceased donor kidney would avoid the morbidity and risk to a living donor, but the kidney may undergo some injury at the time surrounding the donor death and subsequent cold storage. In contrast, receiving a living donor kidney first is likely to offer the greatest initial long-term survival. Living donor source, even if unrelated and HLA-unmatched, is associated with a higher half-life graft survival than even a zero antigen mismatch deceased donor kidney. A biological parental source would necessarily be a one haplotype match (3 out of 6 antigens) only, but would also be matched for half of all minor antigens. However, the living donor would be exposed to some risk and morbidity. A biological parental living donor might also be the only caretaker and breadwinner for the family, but if a deceased donor transplant is performed first, a living donor who passes the workup now might not be eligible to donate a kidney several years later. For example, this adult might have some health changes in the intervening period that might preclude donation at a later time, such as new onset hypertension or diabetes in this potential living donor. Once the first graft has failed, the child recipient candidate may develop HLA sensitization of varying degrees, though not all children do so. A child who becomes highly sensitized (eg, > 90% of the panel) after the first graft fails might not be compatible to some living donors and might have a long wait towards a second transplant. However, the current allocation scheme in place since December 2014 for deceased donor kidneys in the United States has tried to prioritize the highly sensitized candidate; therefore, it is not impossible to receive a deceased donor transplant weven if highly sensitized.

    "stem": "You are reviewing a clinical trial proposal for the use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) to reduce upper respiratory disease events and immunoglobulin A\nnephropathy (IgAN) flares, and thus prevent disease progression in patients with IgAN and chronic kidney disease stage II or greater. The study will include 100\npatients (double-blind, randomized trial with half placebo and half TMP/SMX) over 5 years. Increase in serum creatinine from baseline is proposed as a surrogate\nmarker of disease progression.\nOf the following, the MOST accurate statement regarding using creatinine as a surrogate marker is",
    "options": [
      "a change in the serum creatinine concentration of 30% is sufficient evidence of efficacy for regulatory approval",
      "the change in the surrogate marker (serum creatinine) will not accurately reflect disease progression",
      "it will not be important to monitor for upper respiratory disease events since creatinine can be measured accurately and easily",
      "the safety monitoring board should withdraw patients with an increase in creatinine concentration of 15% in the first month",
      "using the hard endpoint of end-stage kidney disease will require fewer patients Answer B Surrogate markers are measurements (physiological/biometric parameters [blood pressure, weight]), laboratory and radiology tests (creatinine, biomarkers, bone density), and other tests (Alzheimer test) that are usually easily recorded continuous variables, with known distributions. In this example, it is easier to measure a creatinine than to validate a grading system and record upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) or immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) flares (Figure). This is part of what make surrogate markers appealing. Surrogate markers are also used because they have shorter follow-up time and use fewer samples. For example, interventions that improve the course of progression to end-stage renal disease can be tested by a validated surrogate (perhaps proteinuria or creatinine) over 5 years rather than waiting for subjects to progress to end- stage disease over decades. This has particular advantages for therapies with a small effect over a long period of time or that are effective early in disease course. For creatinine to be used as a surrogate marker of kidney disease progression, it must accurately reflect glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The intervention (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [TMP/SMX]) in the proposed study would not be expected to change the GFR, but would be expected to increase the creatinine concentration of those in the treatment group. This effect is due to trimethoprim inhibiting the tubular secretion of creatinine by the organic ion transporters in the distal tubule. This effect can be minor (10%-20%) in healthy subjects, but can be higher (35%) in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, the change in serum creatinine will not accurately reflect disease progression in this vignette. Optimally, the relationship of the surrogate marker and the endpoint should be well known and understood. For serum creatinine and CKD progression, this relationship is well known and the US Food and Drug Administration currently accepts a doubling of the serum creatinine as a surrogate endpoint for CKD progression. However, even when the relationship is well understood, there can be other factors that influence the surrogate marker or the outcome which distort their relationship. For example, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study evaluated the impact of low protein diet and blood pressure control on CKD progression over 5 years. Unfortunately, some of the interventions directly (and reversibly) lowered GFR (surrogate maker for disease progression). This physiologic impact, which was not accounted for in the design of the trial, made conclusions regarding the interventions’ impact on disease progression difficult. Identifying, refining, and validating surrogate markers is challenging, especially if the pathophysiologic link between the surrogate marker and outcome is not understood. The set of criteria to judge if a causal relationship exists, as proposed by Sir Austin Bradford Hill in 1965, may be helpful (Table). In both examples (the TMP/SMX proposal and the MDRD study), the interventions had a direct short term (reversible) impact on the surrogate marker and not the clinical endpoint. Similarly, an intervention may impact the clinical endpoint, but not the surrogate marker. If hypertension was used as a surrogate marker in a study of CKD caused by glomerulonephritis, then treatment with steroids could improve the clinical outcome but actually worsen the surrogate marker. Alternatively, some interventions may act on both the clinical outcome and surrogate marker pathways independently. For example, statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may both act to reduce proteinuria (surrogate marker), but have separate effects on the clinical outcome of cardiovascular mortality. The proposed study in the vignette hypothesized that the TMP/SMX would reduce URIs, thus reducing IgAN flares and protecting against CKD progression. As diagrammed (Figure), one can see there were proximal clinical outcomes available, but a surrogate marker was chosen for a later clinical event. Using the causation criteria, if the intervention did not reduce URI or IgAN flares, it would not be coherent or plausible that it would cause a reduction in CKD progression. Similarly, if those who saw the greatest reduction in URI or IgAN flares did worse than those with minor reductions, that would argue against causation (biologic gradient). Understanding the normal physiologic and measurement variation of a surrogate marker is important. It is known that there are intra-individual variations in creatinine concentration measurements over time of around 6%. A cut-off of 15% in this situation would be inappropriate, especially if other interventions that change the creatinine may be employed (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). In clinical studies, a data safety monitoring board is tasked with reviewing the research protocol and the plans for data and safety monitoring. They also monitor the progress of the trial with respect to participant safety, but also other factors that would influence whether the trial will yield meaningful results (accrual, data integrity, other study results, etc).

      "tumor biopsy Answer A The patient in the vignette most likely has Wilms tumor. Therefore, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred test, as it will help clarify the nature and extent of the tumor and distinguish it from the other most common abdominal tumor, neuroblastoma, in this age group (Table 1). If any findings during the workup suggest the possibility of neuroblastoma, urinary catecholamines or metanephrines should be sent as they will be elevated in over 90% of such patients. Chest computed tomography may be indicated to rule out chest metastases, but will not clarify the diagnosis of the tumor. A karyotype would be helpful to identify syndromic Wilms patients, especially given the associated genital abnormalities, but will not clarify the tumor type. Plasma renin activity may be elevated in Wilms tumor and could explain the presence of hypertension, but it can elevated in other tumors (eg, congenital mesoblastic nephroma) and does not distinguish the tumor type. Tumor biopsy is contraindicated in stage 1 and 2 patients with tumors that appear localized to the kidney (Table 2), as it can lead to seeding of the peritoneum with metastases. Biopsies may be performed in cases where atypical clinical or radiological features are present that are not suggestive of Wilms tumor. Wilms tumor is the most common kidney tumor in childhood and the fourth most common pediatric cancer. Ninety percent of Wilms patients present before 7 years of age, and 75% present between the age of 1 and 5 years. The mean age of diagnosis of unilateral Wilms tumors is 44 months, and for bilateral tumors the mean age is 31 months. Wilms tumor most often presents with an abdominal mass, sometimes noted while bathing. Forty percent of patients will have abdominal pain. Gross or microscopic hematuria may be present. Wilms tumors tend to be encapsulated tumors, frequently with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis (Figure 1, Figure 2). Tumors may cause obstruction of the renal pelvis and 20% invade the renal vein. Two-thirds of patients will have hypertension, thought to be renin-mediated due to renal ischemia secondary to tumor invasion . Ten percent of Wilms tumor cases are associated with congenital malformation syndromes. Several are overgrowth syndromes:  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: It is caused by 9q22.3 microdeletion. Patients present with hemihypertrophy, macroglossia, omphaloceles or abdominal wall defects, visceromegaly, and hypoglycemia in infancy associated with defects in the H19/IGF2-imprinting control region),  Perlman syndrome: Caused by DIS3L2 mutations. Patients present with renal hamartomas, nephroblastomatosis, and fetal gigantism  Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (GPC3 mutations)  Sotos syndrome (NSD1 mutations) Other syndromes associated with WT1 mutations include:  WAGR syndrome: it results from a deletion of 11p13, which includes the WT1 locus. In addition to Wilms tumor, patients have aniridia, genitourinary anomaly, and mental retardation  Frasier syndrome: Caused by mutations in intron 9 of the WT1 gene, leading to splicing defects and loss of the +KT WT1 isoform. It is characterized by male pseudohermaphroditism: (gonadal dysgenesis/streak gonad despite 46 XY karyotype with either ambiguous genitalia or female genitalia). Frasier syndrome is also associated with focal glomerulosclerosis and chronic renal failure.  Denys-Drash syndrome: Most mutations occur in exon 8 and exon 9 of the WT1 gene, leading to an inability of the WT1 protein to bind DNA. Denys-Drash syndrome is also associated with male pseudohermaphroditism and presents with early onset nephrotic syndrome with diffuse mesangial sclerosis. Wilms tumor may be associated with trisomy 18, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Fanconi anemia (BRCA2/ FANCD1 or PALB2 (FANCN) mutations). There are recommendations for screening for Wilms tumor in these conditions, often by ultrasonography every 3 months from birth until 8 years of age. Assessment of an abdominal mass usually begins with ultrasonography, as in this case, which allows tumors to be differentiated from other causes of abdominal masses, such as ureteropelvic junction obstruction or multicystic kidneys. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to evaluate extent and size of the tumor, and will also demonstrate the areas of hemorrhage (increased signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images) and necrosis (decreased signal on T1, but not T2-weighted images) that are classic for Wilms tumor. The MRI is also necessary to define extension into the renal vein and inferior vena cava, which helps define the stage of Wilms tumor. Alternatively, computed tomography (CT) with contrast may be utilized. Renal function tests and urinalyses are included in the evaluation, and presence of significant proteinuria would suggest Denys-Drash or Frasier syndrome. Complete blood cell count, liver function test, chest and bone radiographs, CT of the chest, bone scan, are used for staging to look for metastases. A workup for von Willebrand disease may be indicated, as 1% to 8% of patients with Wilms tumor develop a secondary von Willebrand disease. In some cases, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)- positron emission tomography (PET)-CT can be used to highlight tumor tissue, especially in cases where bilateral tumor involvement is suspected. Finally, the initial evaluation should include assessment for signs of associated syndromes, including aniridia, developmental delay, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, pseudohermaphroditism, overgrowth, and hemihyperplasia. Consultation with genetics may be helpful. As indicated previously, biopsies are not performed in stage 1 to 2 tumors to avoid seeding the peritoneum. Instead, nephrectomy and tumor resection are the final components for staging. There are both standard and experimental surgical and chemotherapy protocols for treatment of Wilms tumor that have been developed by the Children’s Oncology Group Renal Tumor Committee. Preoperative chemotherapy is considered for patients with bilateral Wilms tumor, Wilms tumor in patients with a solitary kidney, extension of the tumor into the inferior vena cava, or inoperable Wilms tumor or tumor involving contiguous structures. Overall survival in Wilms tumor is 90%. Tumor stage (Table 2) and histology are predictors of prognosis. Favorable histology of a Wilms tumor is characterized by triphasic elements present in normal kidney development with blastemal cells, epithelial (tubules) cells, and stromal cells. Unfavorable histology includes anaplastic features (multipolar polyploidy mitotic figures with nuclear enlargement) and hyperchromasia, which may be focal or diffuse. The presence of nephrogenic rests (abnormal embryonic kidney precursor cells) indicates increased risk for Wilms tumor in the contralateral kidney. Molecular markers may start to be used to assess the tumor as well, as positive immunostaining for B7-H1 (involved in immune co-stimulation) or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosomes 1p and 16q are associated with an increased risk of tumor recurrence, despite favorable histology of Wilms tumor. Nephroblastomatosis, which is sometimes confused with nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor), results from persistent presence of fetal metanephric blastema in the kidney. About 1% of infant kidneys show nephrogenic rests on autopsy and less than 1% of such children undergo neoplastic changes into Wilms tumor. The risk is higher in children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hemihypertrophy, WAGR syndrome, and sporadic aniridia. Renal ultrasonography may demonstrate hypoechoic nodules, sometimes with diffusely enlarged kidney(s). Further imaging with CT/MRI is needed when nephroblastomatosis is suspected. Treatment is controversial, with some recommending chemotherapy, while others advocate careful monitoring with follow-up imaging for progression to Wilms tumor. PREP Pearls  Wilms tumor is the most common kidney tumor that presents in childhood, with 90% presenting before the age of 7 years.  Wilms tumors appear as encapsulated tumors with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis, whereas neuroblastoma typically has poor margins and areas of calcifications on abdominal magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography.  Wilms tumor may be associated with overgrowth syndromes or with WT1 mutation syndromes that often have pseudohermaphroditism as a component of the presentation.

      "viral cytopathic effect Answer A The patient in the vignette has developed recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) immediately after renal transplantation. This strongly supports the presence of a circulating factor as the main pathogenetic pathway. Although genetic defects, viral infections, glomerular hypertension, and drugs are also implicated in FSGS, they are unlikely to cause such massive proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome immediately after renal transplantation. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a disease with progressive glomerular scarring. Studies have shown that podocytes are the principle cells involved in the development of FSGS. Podocytes are epithelial cells of the visceral layer of the kidney’s Bowman capsule. Their function is to form a filtration structure that prevents protein loss to the urine. Clinically, the loss of podocytes and their filtration function results in nephrotic syndrome, consisting of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, and peripheral edema. The pathogenetic pathways postulated to be involved in FSGS can be broadly classified as shown in Table 1. Glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration: This is seen in 2 settings: 1. Reduction in renal mass, which causes glomerular hypertension in the remnant kidney. This, in turn, can cause mechanical stress on the podocytes, leading to structural changes in podocyte cell bodies and adherence to the glomerular basement membrane. These changes are facilitated by angiotensin II and transforming growth factor β-dependent pathways. The animal model that is used to study this effect is the remnant kidney model. 2. Systemic disease such as diabetes and obesity where there is glomerular hypertrophy. The largest glomeruli observed in humans are those in patients with sickle cell anemia, in whom chronic hypoxia is presumed to stimulate glomerular hypertrophy. Glomerulomegaly is also present in patients with sleep apnea and cyanotic congenital heart disease. Obesity-associated FSGS sclerotic lesions are often perihilar, and patients may improve with bariatric surgery even before weight loss occurs. Changes in key adipogenic hormones or redox state have therefore been postulated to cause FSGS in these patients. Drug–induced FSGS: Pamidronate can cause FSGS and nephrotic syndrome. It inhibits actin cytoskeleton formation in osteoclasts and may have a similar effect on podocytes. This effect can be reversed after stopping the drug. Interferon-γ can also affect podocytes through interferon-α and -β receptors on podocytes, resulting in nephrotic syndrome. Virus-induced FSGS: Viruses can cause direct injury to podocytes, and induce production of inflammatory mediators. Examples include HIV and parvovirus. Viral genes such as negative regulatory factor (Nef) and viral protein R (Vpr) are causal for HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Nef promotes podocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation and dysregulation of actin cytoskeleton. Vpr mediates tubular epithelial G2 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Genetic Defects These can be broadly classified as defects involving: (a) slit diaphragm-associated molecules, (b) podocyte actin cytoskeleton-related molecules, (c) podocyte transcription factors, (d) adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules, (e) podocyte mitochondrial injury, and (f) susceptibility genes. Examples of such genetic defects are presented in Table 2. An example of a susceptibility gene is apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). APOL1 gene risk variant-associated nephropathy is a spectrum of kidney diseases including FSGS, hypertension, sickle cell nephropathy, and severe lupus nephritis. The risk variants G1 (S342G:I384M) and G2 (del.N388/Y389) are 2 coding variants in the APOL1 gene on chromosome 22q13. The mutant alleles confer protection against trypanosomal infections in people of African descent at the cost of an increased risk of kidney disease. Although 51% of individuals of African descent have at least 1 risk allele and 13% have 2 risk alleles, only a subset of individuals with genetic risk develops kidney disease. It is likely that the interplay between APOL1 and several modifiable environmental factors or interactive genes such as NPHS2, SDCCAG8, and BMP4 produces the variable spectrum of APOL1 nephropathy. Circulating factors In recurrences of primary FSGS postkidney transplant, diffuse foot process effacement can be observed within minutes after reperfusion. This is followed by massive proteinuria developing within hours to days after the kidney transplant as described in the vignette. With time, the characteristic FSGS lesion develops. Thus, foot process effacement is the earliest structural change and key initial event in the development of FSGS. A putative circulating permeability factor has been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of primary FSGS and is supported by clinical and experimental evidence, including: (I) the rapid appearance of proteinuria following kidney transplant; (II) the efficacy of plasmapheresis in reducing proteinuria following recurrence; (III) administration of serum from patients with FSGS into rodents causes proteinuria; (IV) resolution of proteinuria and histological changes when transplanted kidneys with recurrent FSGS are reimplanted in patients with end-stage renal disease secondary to diseases other than FSGS. Despite extensive research, the putative permeability factors have not been precisely identified. A candidate factor has been recently described: the soluble form of the urokinase-plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). Significantly elevated suPAR concentrations are observed in some patients with primary and recurrent FSGS. High suPAR concentrations prior to kidney transplant significantly increase the risk for recurrence of FSGS in the allograft. Higher postkidney transplant concentrations are observed in patients with recurrence of FSGS compared to non-recurrence. In podocytes, high concentrations of suPAR can pathologically activate β3 integrin, which plays an important role in anchoring podocytes to the glomerular basement membrane and the development of mature foot processes. Activation leads to foot process effacement, proteinuria, and initiation of FSGS. However, a number of recent studies have questioned the specific pathogenic role of suPAR in “primary” FSGS. Briefly, the data need to be reconciled with the fact that: (I) suPAR levels (at least the isoforms measured by conventional assays) are very much determined by the prevailing glomerular filtration rate level; (II) the exact source of the suPAR found in the plasma of some subjects with primary FSGS is unknown; (III) elevated suPAR levels (even higher than patients with biopsy proven FSGS) have been reported in other glomerular diseases, as well as a number of diseases in the absence of proteinuria; (IV) pretransplant suPAR levels do not predict the recurrence of FSGS following transplantation; (V) serum suPAR levels are higher in FSGS secondary to genetic mutations compared with primary FSGS; and (VI) a significant number of patients with FSGS have normal suPAR levels.

      "return (postfilter) pressure Answer A The term flux technically describes the efficacy in removing fluid during hemodialysis (HD). It is mainly a product of the filter membrane type and its porosity, or permeability to water. This variable, the ultrafiltration coefficient (Kuf), was defined by the rate of fluid removal per unit of pressure and expressed in mL/h per mm Hg. Early membrane types, like cellulose-based membranes, had limited porosity and ultrafiltration capabilities. However, with the advent of synthetic membrane use, there is greater reproducibility of thinner walled fibers with uniform porosity and larger Kuf values. Therefore, membranes can be separated, based on their Kuf values, into low-flux and high-flux types. Low-flux membranes are generally defined as those with Kuf values less than 10 mL/h per mm Hg, however, this threshold varies by country (at one point, the US threshold was < 8 mL/h per mm Hg). With low-flux dialysis, knowledge of the Kuf value was essential, as it was utilized by the dialysis machine operator to estimate ultrafiltrate (UF) volumes by the equation: UF (mL) = Kuf x Transmembrane Pressure (mm Hg) x Dialysis Time (hours) Operators would then try to achieve transmembrane pressures during a dialysis treatment to achieve the desired UF for that treatment, similar to the scenario presented in the vignette. In low-flux membranes, the relationship between UF rate and the transmembrane pressure (TMP) is linear. Therefore, adjustments to the settings of the dialysis machine to affect the TMP need to be considered. The TMP is the hydrostatic pressure gradient across the filter, blood on one side (which should be a positive value) from that of the dialysate, or effluent (which should be neutral or negative) on the other side. This may be best represented by the formula: TMP = (arterial filter pressure + venous return pressure)/2 – effluent pressure This is also visualized in Figure 1. This may be best thought of in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) where many of these pressures are still measured even today. Historically, the HD machine operators could then manipulate some of these parameters by altering the settings of the machine. As blood flow rate often directly correlates with the filter pressure, increasing the blood flow rate would result in increased filter pressure, and subsequently increased TMP. Often, the HD nurse or technician applied a C-clamp along venous blood return line from the filter to increase the return pressure and therefore the TMP. Therefore, decreasing the blood flow rate or the return pressure would have the opposite effect and result in a lower UF rate in the setting of low-flux dialysis. Making the effluent pressure (postfilter) more negative would also result in an increase in TMP. In the setting of intermittent HD, this may be more difficult to achieve. Changes to the dialysate flow rate are less likely to have any net effect on the effluent pressure, unless there is some resistance to dialysate inflow, as normally the dialysate inflow and outflow will be close to equal. In the scenario that there is restriction to the dialysate inflow, when there is an expected amount of dialysate outflow, this may create a more negative effluent pressure. Decreasing the dialysate flow rate in this artificial scenario would result in a less negative effluent pressure and a lower TMP, while increasing the dialysate flow rate would have the opposite effect. In true practice, HD machines typically estimate TMP from 2 pressure sensors, the venous blood return line and the dialysate inflow, so it would be hard to even create this scenario. However, in CRRT machines that have more pressure sensors, these concepts are more critical. Creating a more negative effluent pressure can be more easily achieved by increasing the replacement fluid rate in the setting of continuous hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration. The effluent pumps on scale-based CRRT machines look to collect all effluent, which includes dialysate, replacement fluid, and UF volumes. By increasing replacement fluid rates on the blood side of the filter, the effluent pressure will be increased (made more negative) to collect this additional fluid from across the filter membrane, thus increasing the TMP. This concept of achieving a set effluent pressure in CRRT is important to understand, as it also may explain situations in which these machines may overfiltrate the patient. As the effluent pump is programmed to achieve a net fluid removal rate in CRRT, it will do so at the expense of other fluid flow rates. Therefore, if there is an issue with either dialysate or replacement fluid flow (obstruction, empty bags, human error), the effluent pressure will remove additional fluid from the blood compartment. There should be various alarms warning of these issues, but if ignored or not corrected, could result in hypovolemia to the patient. A rise in TMP is also well known to be a harbinger of clotting of the filter, both in CRRT and intermittent HD. Therefore, it would seem that factors that may cause clotting, such as decreasing anti-coagulation, would lead to increased TMP because of filter clotting and increased UF rates. However, increased clotting leads to a decreased number of membrane fibers or total surface area available for UF, thus this would have a negligible or even worsening effect on UF capacity. Although low-flux membranes are rarely used nowadays, the concepts of flux and how it may be affected continues to be studied. This is especially true in CRRT, as the effects on the dialysis filter are extended beyond the typical 4 hours of intermittent HD. The effect of blood proteins on dialytic membranes is of particular interest, especially as they may adsorb to the filter and affect both solute and fluid removal. The gradual layering of proteins along the surface of the filter can have an adverse effect on clearance, especially of larger molecules. However, the oncotic pressure of plasma proteins can be more pronounced as blood becomes more concentrated, which may have an effect on the hydrostatic pressure of the blood. Several studies have looked at the effect of plasma oncotic pressure of the blood on the ultrafiltration coefficient (Kuf) of membranes, showing a negative effect, represented as: Kuf α TMP – protein oncotic pressure Thus, as the oncotic pressure, or protein level, is decreased in the blood, the greater the capacity for UF by the filter. Therefore, the use of intravenous albumin or albumin priming allows for greater movement of fluid from the interstitium into the intravascular space in the patient. However, avoiding the use of albumin would decrease the oncotic pressure of the blood and, theoretically, increases the ultrafiltration capacity of the given low-flux dialysis membrane in this vignette. Additionally, the concepts behind Kuf also have implications in high-flux dialysis, even though it may not be the limiting factor in achieving UF. Since the Kuf value is so much higher with newer membranes, it is no longer a limitation to fluid removal during the dialysis treatment, and high removal rates can easily be achieved by machines with an automated UF control system. However, because of the increased permeability of the high-flux membrane both to fluid and to middle-sized molecules, the purity of dialysate is important. Back filtration of endotoxins from the dialysate to the blood could occur if the hydrostatic pressure on the dialysate side exceeds that of the blood (Figure 2). This typically occurs as the osmotic pressure in the blood drops, so it may be seen in longer dialysis filters. If the dialysate was not ultrapure and accidentally contaminated, this could cause a febrile reaction in the patient being exposed to endotoxin. PREP Pearls  The ultrafiltration coefficient, Kuf, was historically used to calculate the necessary transmembrane pressure in order to achieve the desired hourly ultrafiltration rate in cellulose-based membranes, using the formula: UF (mL) = Kuf x Transmembrane Pressure (mm Hg) x Dialysis Time (hours)  Transmembrane pressure (TMP) is affected by the arterial and venous pressures of the blood, as well as the effluent pressure. Factors that increase these pressures, such as blood flow rates (arterial and venous), resistance on the return side (venous), and fluid removal rates (effluent pressure) all may increase the TMP.

      "scoliosis Answer B Prune belly syndrome (also known as Eagle-Barrett syndrome) was first recognized in the late 1800s and has a reported incidence of 3.76 cases per 100,000 live births. While females may be affected, there is a male predominance. It is more prevalent in persons of African-Caribbean descent. There are 3 cardinal features of the syndrome: deficient or absent abdominal musculature, hydroureteronephrosis, and undescended testes (cryptorchidism). While congenital hip dislocation, imperforate anus, pectus excavatum, and scoliosis may be observed in patients with prune belly syndrome, only cryptorchidism is part of the triad and among the choices provided is most commonly observed in patients with prune belly syndrome. There are 2 theories regarding the pathophysiology of prune belly syndrome. The first is that the urethra becomes transiently obstructed during development (possibly due to a hypoplastic prostate). Urethral obstruction leads to dilation, which prevents normal bladder and abdominal muscular development. The alternative theory is that prune belly syndrome results from abnormal mesoderm development. Collagen and fibrous tissue replaces smooth muscle, which manifests as a dilated urinary tract with or without obstruction or vesicoureteral reflux. Sarcomeres allow smooth muscles to contract and are composed of thick myosin filaments and thin actin filaments. Recently, mutations in smooth muscle actin ACTG2 and Myh11 (smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 11 that is a part of the myosin complex in smooth muscles) have been identified in patients with prune belly syndrome. Deletions of the renal developmental gene HNF1β have also been reported in patients with prune belly syndrome. As indicated previously, there is a spectrum of urologic manifestations in prune belly syndrome. The urinary tract may be dilated from urethra to the renal pelvis. On ultrasonography, there is a distended thin-walled bladder with hydroureter and hydronephrosis. The fibrous and collagen replacement of smooth muscle in the ureter may be patchy and discontinuous along the length of the ureter, and most often involves the distal ureter. Seventy-five percent of patients will have vesicoureteral reflux (Figure 2). Patients with prune belly syndrome may also have associated vesicoureteral junction obstruction. The dilated bladder is a low pressure system, which bulges upon distension but lacks the trabeculations or muscle hypertrophy that are typical of posterior urethral valves. Urodynamic studies of patients with prune belly syndrome demonstrate intact bladder storage capacity, but poor detrusor contractions result in high post-void residuals. In some cases, complete urethral atresia may be present. Urethral atresia may be associated with a patent urachus that may have allowed for decompression of the urinary system during embryogenesis. Most often in prune belly syndrome, the prostatic urethra appears long and wide, without any evidence of an obstruction (Figure 3). The urethral dilation may be due to redundant folds of urethra mucosa. The anterior urethra may also be dilated in up to 70% of patients. There is a classification system for prune belly syndrome based in part on extrarenal manifestations. The most common complications of prune belly syndrome are pulmonary, with up to two-thirds of patients affected. Impaired renal function and oligohydramnios in prune belly syndrome can result in Potter sequence, with pulmonary hypoplasia and club feet. The 20% of patients with prune belly syndrome that present with pulmonary hypoplasia, oligohydramnios, renal dysplasia, urethral obstruction, patent urachus, and club feet typical of Potter sequence have been classified as “type 1” and have nearly 100% mortality. Type 2 patients (40%) have hydroureteronephrosis, uropathy, renal dysplasia, uremia, and typical extrarenal manifestations (eg, cryptorchidism/abdominal musculature deficiency), and are at risk of urosepsis and azotemia. Progression to end-stage renal disease is most often due to recurrent pyelonephritis and obstructive nephropathy due to incomplete bladder emptying. The final 40% of patients with prune belly syndrome are classified as Type 3 and have mild or incomplete extra-renal manifestations of cryptorchidism or abdominal musculature deficiency. These patients are considered to have prune belly “variants,” and may have normal renal function and mild uropathy. Numerous additional extrarenal findings are associated with prune belly syndrome (Table). These include gastrointestinal tract manifestations, such as malrotation and constipation. There may also be associated cardiac defects and neurologic disease. PREP Pearls  The classic prune belly syndrome triad consists of hydroureteronephrosis, cryptorchadism, and abdominal wall muscular defect.  The 20% of patients with the most severe forms of severe prune belly syndrome with urethral atresia and Potter sequence have nearly 100% postnatal mortality.  Prune belly syndrome can be associated with Potter sequence (pulmonary hypoplasia and club feet) as well as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and neurologic abnormalities.

      "voiding cystourethrogram Answer D The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an inherited neurocutaneous disorder that is characterized by pleomorphic features involving many organ systems, including multiple benign hamartomas of the brain, eyes, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and skin. The expression of the disease varies substantially. The diagnosis of TSC is usually made clinically. Nearly all patients with TSC have one or more of the skin lesions characteristic of the disorder. Skin lesions include hypopigmented macules also known as ash leaf spots, angiofibromas also called fibroadenomas, and shagreen patches that are most commonly seen over the lower trunk. Most patients with TSC have epilepsy, and one-half or more have cognitive deficits and learning disabilities; other common manifestations include autism, behavioral problems, and psychosocial difficulties. Seizures begin in the first year of life in about 60% of patients. Central nervous system manifestations of TSC are usually associated with brain lesions including glioneuronal hamartomas (also called tubers), periventricular giant cell astrocytomas, and abnormalities of cerebral white matter detected on neuroimaging studies. However, there is a wide variety of phenotypes between and within families regarding the number and severity of TSC manifestations. Cardiac rhabdomyomas characteristically develop in utero and are frequently detected on prenatal ultrasonography. Although mostly asymptomatic, patients with TSC and cardiac rhabdomyomas are more likely to be symptomatic in the newborn and early infancy period. After infancy, cardiac rhabdomyomas usually undergo spontaneous regression. Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 live births. It is caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 gene or the TSC2 gene. De novo mutations account for approximately 80% of TSC cases, with TSC2 mutations being approximately 4 times as common as TSC1 mutations among de novo cases, while the prevalence of TSC1 and TSC2 mutations is approximately equal among familial TSC cases. The most common renal lesions associated with TSC are angiomyolipomas (AMLs), cysts, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Less common renal manifestations include oncocytoma, interstitial disease, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The prevalence of renal lesions in TSC increases with age, eventually affecting up to 80% of patients. The prevalence and types of renal disease in patients with TSC have been evaluated in a number of studies, with a prevalence over time of 60% to 85%.  Angiomyolipoma is the most common renal lesion observed among patients with TSC. Among patients with TSC, the prevalence and size of renal AMLs increase with age. Renal AMLs are more numerous and larger in size in women than in men, suggesting a hormonal effect on TSC development and growth. This is also true in prepubertal girls, who have higher estradiol levels than boys. The increasing prevalence with age and importance of sex were illustrated in a study of 164 children with TSC seen at the Mayo Clinic who underwent serial renal ultrasonography or computed tomography. There were no renal AMLs in the first year of life. In contrast, renal AMLs were present in 37% of the children between 1 and 5 years of age, and in 41% of boys and 63% of girls after 5 years of age. Increasing prevalence and an increase in number and size of renal AMLs with increasing age has been described in children with TSC. In a longitudinal study of 60 TSC patients, renal AMLs were present in 48% of boys and 60% of girls at a mean age of 6.9 years, and in 76% of boys and 83% of girls at follow-up at a mean age of 10.5 years. Although renal involvement is common in TSC, the majority of patients have few or no symptoms related to the renal disease. The most common clinical manifestations of symptomatic renal AMLs are either because of hemorrhage (hematuria, intratumoral or retroperitoneal hemorrhage) or due to the mass effect (abdominal or flank mass, flank pain and/or tenderness, hypertension, and renal insufficiency). The chances of developing symptoms are directly related to AML size. As a rule, renal AMLs larger than 4 cm are more likely to grow, develop microaneurysms and macroaneurysms, and cause symptoms. Hypertension may be observed. Hypertension is less common in patients who only have renal AMLs compared with patients who have renal cysts with or without AMLs. Some patients develop significant renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, because of destruction of renal tissue related to extensive bilateral renal AMLs.  Cystic renal disease is the second most common renal manifestation of TSC after AMLs. Three different types of renal cystic disease have been associated with TSC: single or multiple renal cysts, TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome, and glomerulocystic kidney disease. In most patients with TSC, the number of renal cysts is limited, their size is small, and they cause no symptoms. The prevalence of renal cysts increases with age and is more common in males than females. The TSC2 gene and the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease type 1 (PKD1) gene lie adjacent to each other in a tail-to-tail orientation on chromosome 16 at 16p13.3. Deletions inactivating both genes are associated with polycystic kidneys, a disorder that is called the TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome. Affected patients are usually diagnosed during the first year of life or early childhood, but rarely patients are not diagnosed until adulthood, with hypertension and renal insufficiency being the major manifestations. Glomerulocystic kidney disease is a rare finding that is usually diagnosed during the neonatal period. Seven of the 8 reported cases were unilateral, and 4 cases had segmental lesions with normal kidney tissue on the affected side. Affected kidneys were typically enlarged and had renal cysts on imaging studies and glomerular cysts on histologic examination.  Patients with TSC are at increased risk for the development of RCC, most often the clear cell type, but the risk of renal cell cancer is not well-defined. Of the response choices, renal ultrasonography is the preferred response. Initial evaluation can also be done by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to better define the presence and the severity of renal involvement; if the kidneys are normal, follow-up renal ultrasonography once every 2 to 3 years is recommended. In those with abnormal renal findings or change of clinical status, a closer follow-up with ultrasonography, MRI, or computed tomography, depending on the clinical indication, is recommended. Since the cardiac rhabdomyoma is asymptomatic and hemodynamically insignificant, cardiac catheterization is not correct in this case. Central nervous system biopsy is also not correct because the diagnosis can be made with MRI. Colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy are not correct answers because the gastrointestinal tract is not typically involved in TSC. PREP Pearls  Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Tuberous sclerosis complex is commonly associated with renal lesions including angiomyolipomas (AMLs), cysts, and renal cell carcinoma.  Angiomyolipomas are the most common renal lesions among patients with TSC.

    "explanation": "C. intraperitoneally through a midline incision\nIn adults, the standard surgical placement of a renal allograft is subcutaneously in the right or lower left flank\nthrough an oblique incision. The allograft kidney artery and vein are anastomosed (typically, end to side) to the\nexternal iliac vessels of the recipient. The donor ureter is attached to the urinary bladder using an extravesical\napproach (Lich-Gregoire technique), which is favored over an intravesical approach (Leadbetter-Politano\ntechnique). Some surgeons will place an indwelling double-J ureteral stent across the neoureterocystostomy for\nvariable lengths of time. The native kidneys very rarely need to be removed. The same procedure is generally\nfollowed in childen greater than 30 kg weight.\nIn small children (typically < 10 kg), however, these techniques require modifications. Small donor kidneys are\nnot placed in small recipients to avoid the high risk of thrombosis of small donor vessels anastamosed to small\nrecipient vessels. Therefore, a larger donor kidney from an older child or adult is used. The small child recipient\ndoes not have enough space in the subcutaneous flank fascia to accommodate a larger renal allograft. These\nchildren have their renal allograft placed intraperitoneally via a midline incision. The donor kidney blood\nvessels are anastomosed to the recipient’s largest vessels, the aorta and inferior vena cava. The presence of an\nappendicovesicotomy at the umbilicus does not preclude a midline incision for intraperitoneal placement of the\nnew kidney. This intraperitoneal kidney is not as fixed in position as a subcutaneous kidney and may be harder\nto biopsy later, especially if the child has grown a lot and the kidney has migrated within the abdominal cavity,\nwith bowel interposition anteriorly. Intraperitoneal kidneys do not suffer the complication of lymphocoele,\nwhich occurs in a small fraction of subcutaneously placed kidneys. Blood flow to a large adult kidney can be\nconsiderable, such that native kidneys may need to be removed in a small recipient to allow adequate blood\nflow to the transplant kidney.\nIn children between 10 to 30 kg, the type of incision and placement of the renal allograft is individualized based\non the child’s size and blood vessel caliber.\nOf the response choices, only response choice C presents the correct combination of procedures.\nPREP Pearls\n Adults and older children have a transplant kidney placed subcutaneously in right or left lower flank, via an\noblique incision.\n Small children need an intraperitoneal allograft placement via a midline incision.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the anatomy and surgical considerations for a renal transplant in an infant or child\n\nSuggested Readings\n Dharnidharka VR, Fiorina P, Harmon WE.

Broadly, the human immune system has 2 components: innate immunity and adaptive immunity,\ncompared in Table .\nNeutrophils and complement are examples of innate immune system components. The adaptive immune system\nis divided broadly into humoral (antigen-specific antibodies) and cell-mediated (T cells and perhaps B cells)\ncomponents. Antigen presentation to naïve CD4+ T cells occurs via stellate-shaped, tissue-resident dendritic\ncells, which are therefore called professional antigen presenting cells. In contrast, under certain conditions,\nother cell types such as endothelial cells, B cells or renal tubular epithelial cells may be able to express antigens\nto mature T cells, so they are known as semiprofessional antigen presenting cells. Once the CD4 T cell is\nactivated, it may induce the recruitment of CD8+ effector T cells, which produce granzyme B and perforin to\ndisrupt the cell membrane of the invading microbe.\nMonocytes are mononuclear myeloid cells that develop in the bone marrow and circulate within the\nbloodstream. Human monocytes are defined by expression of the cell surface markers CD11b and CD115. They\nare currently considered to be part of the innate immune system, within the monocyte-macrophage-dendritic\ncell subset, also called the mononuclear phagocyte system. Previously, they were thought to be not much more\n\nthan circulating precursors of tissue macrophages, but are now believed to perform important tissue surveying\nfunctions themselves. Increasingly, these innate immunity cells are now recognized from mouse studies as vital\nto the process of recognizing non-self antigens and initiation of alloimmunity, thus linking innate to adaptive\nimmunity.\nMonocytes are a heterogeneous population, which quickly respond to stimuli including Toll-like receptor\nsignaling following exposure to pathogens and to inflammatory cytokines. After recruitment to the local area,\nthey can develop into a wide range of terminally differentiated cells, including tissue macrophages and also\nsome types of dendritic cells. They can perform versatile functions during infection, tumor formation and in the\nsetting of chronic inflammation, dependent on context and milieu. These functions include direct microbicidal\neffects through tumor necrosis factor and inducible nitric oxide synthase, transporting antigens to T cells, and\norchestrating the function of other cells such as neutrophils (Figure).\nIn humans, monocytes can be divided into 2 (or 3) subsets based on CD14 and CD16 expression, analogous to\nthe Ly6C in mice. CD14+CD16+ and CD14+CD16- monocytes resemble mouse inflammatory monocytes and\nexpress CCR2 and traffic to the site of infection or inflammation to carry out antimicrobial or proinflammatory\nfunctions. Human CD14loCD16+ cells express CX3CR1 and are involved in endothelial patrolling, similar to\n\nmouse CX3CR1hi monocytes. In resting states, the largest monocyte pool is actually in the bone marrow and\nspleen.\nIn the response choices, B cells may express antigen to CD4+ T cells, not the other way around. Dendritic cells\nare considered professional, not semiprofessional. Macrophages are intimately related to monocytes. Granzyme\nB and perforin are not secreted by monocytes but rather by CD8 T cells. Option D is the only correct answer.\nPREP Pearls\n Monocytes are part of the larger dendritic cell-macrophage-monocyte system within innate immunity.\n Innate immune system components are responsible for activating the adaptive immune system.\n The innate and adaptive immune systems communicate with each other.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the role of monocytes in cell-mediated immunity\nSuggested Readings\n Mitchell AJ, Roediger B, Weninger W.

Cystic\nglomeruli are found in a variety of congenital or acquired renal diseases; accordingly, it is important to\ndistinguish between the terms “Glomerulocystic Kidney” (GCK) and “Glomerulocystic Kidney Disease”\n(GCKD). A GCK is defined by the presence of more than 5% cystic glomeruli. Glomerulocystic kidney disease\nis an inherited/familial subtype of GCK caused by defined genetic mutations. The GCK may be congenital or\nacquired, and can be found in association with a number of other identifiable diseases, as shown in the\nTable.\n\n\n\nLennerz et al recently proposed a modified diagnostic classification of disease entities presenting with\nglomerular cysts:\n Type I: Autosomal dominant or recessive polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD/ARPKD), which is familial\nand nonsyndromic, and affects both kidneys\n Type II: Familial/hereditary GCKD caused by mutations in HNF1β/TCF2 or UMOD (uromodulin)\nmutations. The HNF1β/TCF2 mutations cause familial hypoplastic GCKD with or without diabetes. The\nUMOD mutations are associated with GCKD and hyperuricemia.\n\n Type III: Syndromic GCK, which can be unilateral or segmental and is seen in malformation syndromes\nsuch as trisomy, 9, 13, or 18\n Type IV: Obstructive GCK with or without dysplasia; may be unilateral or bilateral\n Type V: Sporadic GCK with no familial pattern, nonsyndromic, caused by ischemia (usually unilateral) or\nis drug-induced (bilateral).\nSonographically, it is difficult to distinguish GCK from other cystic renal diseases. The GCK presents with\nunilateral or bilateral echogenic kidneys detected on fetal ultrasonography and may suggest a variety of\npathologies including cystic renal dysplasia or ARPKD. Glomerular cysts are too small to be detected by\nultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging is a better diagnostic modality, especially in older children and\nadults. However, the distinction between GCK and renal dysplasia can be subtle and only accomplished by\ndetailed histopathological examination.\nThe newborn in the vignette has familial GCKD associated with TCF2 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-β) mutation.\nWhen GCKD is associated with type 2 diabetes, the clinician should suspect MODY (maturity-onset diabetes\ntype 5), which can be confirmed by genetic testing via DNA sequencing. Prenatal genetic diagnosis can be\noffered to the parents via chorionic villus sampling and DNA sequencing.\nMeasurement of α-fetoprotein is not helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of GCK. Magnetic resonance imaging\nis helpful in finding large glomerular cysts, but is not diagnostic of GCKD. A percutaneous renal biopsy may\nprovide a tissue diagnosis of GCK with or without dysplasia, but will not be diagnostic of underlying etiology.\nComparative genomic hybridization is used for analyzing copy number variations of a test sample compared to\na reference sample and will not be helpful in this patient.\nPREP Pearls\n Glomerulocystic kidney (GCK) is a heterogeneous disorder that can be congenital or acquired and can be divided\ninto 5 etiological categories.\n Glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD) is a type of hereditary GCK caused by gene mutations in TCF2,\nuromodulin, and possibly others.

    "explanation": "B. hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome\nThe patient in the vignette has a hyperosmolar state. The calculated serum osmolality in this patient is: 2(Na) +\nglucose/18 + BUN/2.8 = 346 mOsm/kg (reference range: 275-298 mOsm/kg). The causes of hyperosmolar\nstates will be discussed later in this critique. The measurement of serum osmolality is based on the measurement\nof the freezing-point depression of water due to solutes in solution. Freezing-point depression is linearly related\nto solute concentration. When 1 mole of any nonionic solute is dissolved in a kg of water, the freezing point is\nlowered by 1.858°C. A mole of an electrolyte or ionic substance will lower the freezing point several-fold more\nthan this, depending on how many ions are formed when the substance is dissolved. Of note, osmolality is\nusually measured on serum, not plasma, because anticoagulants such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\n(EDTA) contribute to osmolality. However, heparinized plasma can be used.\nHyperosmolar states can be caused by one or more conditions, some of which may coexist in the same patient.\nThese include hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), severe\nhypernatremia, ethanol intoxication, and ethylene glycol ingestion. The patient in the vignette fulfills the criteria\nof HHS: serum glucose greater than 600 mg/dL (33 mmol/L), serum osmolality greater than 330 mOsm/kg (330\nmmol/kg), absence of significant ketosis and acidosis (serum bicarbonate concentration > 15 mEq/L [15\nmmol/L]), urine ketone (acetoacetate) concentration less than 15 mg/dL (1,469 μmol/L), and negative or trace\nketone on urine dipstick. Although DKA is more commonly seen in children, the incidence of HHS due to\ndiabetes in children is rising. Since the pathophysiology and treatment of HHS and DKA are different, and\nbecause HHS has a high mortality rate, it is important to recognize the child with HHS on presentation.\nUnlike the child with DKA who usually presents with hyperventilation, vomiting, and abdominal pain, the\nprogressive polyuria and polydipsia of HHS may go unrecognized. As a result, both dehydration and electrolyte\nloss are more profound in HHS than DKA; in adults, fluid losses in HHS have been estimated to be twice those\nof DKA. Furthermore, obesity and hyperosmolality can mask the clinical assessment of dehydration. There is\nevidence to suggest that intake of copious quantities of carbonated sugar-enriched drinks before presentation (as\nin the child in the vignette) may be a common feature of patients presenting with severe hyperglycemia. Since\nthere is a greater degree of dehydration in HHS, children with HHS require more aggressive replacement of\nintravascular volume during treatment than do children with DKA. Complications of HHS include\nrhabdomyolysis, cerebral edema, hypercoagulability, and venous thrombosis.\nAlthough severe hypernatremia caused by dehydration or salt intoxication is a relatively common cause of\nhyperosmolar states, the child in the vignette has mild hypernatremia. The lack of a significant osmolal gap and\npresence of hyperglycemia are not usually seen in ethanol or ethyl glycol ingestions.\n\nPREP Pearls\n Hyperosmolar states can be caused by one or more conditions, some of which may coexist in the same patient,\nincluding hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), severe hypernatremia,\nethanol intoxication, and ethylene glycol ingestion.\n Unlike the child with DKA who usually presents with hyperventilation, vomiting, and abdominal pain, the\nprogressive polyuria and polydipsia of HHS may go unrecognized.\n Type 2 diabetic children often present with HHS, even though DKA is more commonly seen in children.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the causes of hyperosmolar syndromes\nSuggested Readings\n Price A, Losek J, Jackson B.

    "explanation": "C. elevated triglycerides\nIndividuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a very high cardiovascular morbidity. Dyslipidemia is a\nknown risk factor for atherosclerosis. Underlying proposed mechanisms for development of dyslipidemia are\naltered insulin resistance, particularly at the vascular endothelium of smooth muscle, and impaired catabolism\nof triglyceride-rich lipoprotein by decreased activity of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic triglyceride lipase. This\nresults in increases of non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C, defined as total cholesterol minus\nHDL) and secondary enrichment of triglycerides (TGL). In CKD, non-HDL-C is a better estimate of\ncardiovascular risk profile as there is accumulation of not only low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), but\nalso intermediate-density and chylomicron variants that are captured by non-HDL-C. Moreover, non-HDL-C\ncan be accurately obtained even in the nonfasting state. The HDL-C depletes as TGL enrichment occurs.\nAcceleration of kidney injury with dyslipidemia is well documented in animal models where dyslipidemia\ndamages glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells. The inflammation pathway is activated either by\nmesangial cells, macrophages, or formation of reactive oxygen species through the extracellular matrix\nmolecules. In adults, dyslipidemia has been linked to renal disease progression in diabetic nephropathy.\nWhether this dyslipidemia-induced progression is independent of underlying hypertension or diabetes is\nunclear.\nSaland et al studied the prevalence and pattern of dyslipidemia in 391 children with CKD and median measured\niohexol glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 43 mL/min per 1.73 m2 from the Chronic Kidney Disease in\nChildren study. Hypertriglyceridemia (defined as serum TGL level > 130 mg/dL [3.4 mmol/L]) was the most\nprevalent abnormality seen in 126 children, while 62 children had elevated non-HDL-cholesterol (defined as\nnon HDL-C > 160 mg/dL [4.1 mmol/L]) and 83 had reduced HDL cholesterol (defined as HDL-C < 40 mg/dL\n[1 mmol/L]). Overall, 177 children had dyslipidemia, with 79 having combined abnormalities. Lower levels of\nGFR were associated not only with an increased prevalence of dyslipidemia, but also with an increased\nprevalence of combined dyslipidemia. Increased prevalence of dyslipidemia and combined dyslipidemia were\nalso seen with increasing levels of proteinuria. Being overweight or obese increased the odds of having\ndyslipidemia compared to normal weight children.\nThe Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization developed clinical practice guidelines\non lipid management for all adults and children with CKD. The key recommendation from the guidelines is the\nuse of statin or statin/ezetimibe treatment in adults aged 50 years or older with estimated GFR less than 60\nmL/min per 1.73 m2, but they did not recommend similar treatment for patients receiving chronic dialysis or\nafter kidney transplantation. This recommendation was largely derived from the Study of Heart and Renal\nProtection (SHARP) study that indicated simvastatin/ezetimibe combination therapy reduces the risk of major\n\natherosclerotic events (coronary death, myocardial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, or any revascularization)\ncompared with the placebo in people with a GFR of less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Given the high\ncardiovascular risk among people with CKD, even with stages 1 and 2, the large body of evidence supporting\nthe efficacy of statins in the general population, and the lack of justification for a new trial performed\nspecifically in people with stage 1 and 2 CKD, KDIGO guidelines suggest statin therapy for patients older than\n50 years of age and stages 1 and 2 CKD. In dialysis patients, the magnitude of any relative reduction in risk\nwith statin therapy appears to be substantially smaller than in earlier stages of CKD, and initiation of statin\ntreatment is not recommended for most prevalent hemodialysis patients. Fibrate therapy used to lower TGL\nlevels in CKD has not been studied in great detail. However, because fibrate therapy has been shown to\npotentially worsen CKD and, because the net clinical benefit was not clear, current guidelines suggest avoiding\nfibrate therapy in adults with CKD.\nIn both adults and children with hypertriglyceridemia, therapeutic lifestyle modifications such as dietary\nchanges (use judiciously in children), weight reduction, increased physical activity, and treatment of\nhyperglycemia (if present) are recommended. The recommendations for children with elevated non-HDL-C is\nhampered by lack of long-term data because the beneficial effect and safety profile of statins has yet to be\nstudied for periods greater than 10 years.\nPREP Pearls\n Lower levels of glomerular filtration rate, increasing proteinuria, and obesity are associated not only with an\nincreased prevalence of dyslipidemia in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but also with an increased\nprevalence of combined dyslipidemia.\n Hypertriglyceridemia (as defined as serum triglyceride level > 130 mg/dL [3.4 mmol/L]) is the most prevalent\ndyslipidemia in children with CKD.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Recognize the lipid abnormalities in chronic kidney disease in children\nSuggested Readings\n Saland JM, Pierce CB, Mitsnefes MM, et al.

    "explanation": "A. blood transfusion needs\nThe success of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is\ncontingent upon the ability to maintain adequate blood flow over a protracted period of time to allow for the\nmore gradual hourly fluid removal but still effective clearance of this dialytic modality. Anticoagulation is\ntypically required, as prospective pediatric CRRT (ppCRRT) registry studies have shown that the use of\nanticoagulation prolongs the median CRRT filter life to 50% to 60% while reducing the rate of clotting by about\n50% compared to using no anticoagulation. Therefore, the issue of anticoagulation in CRRT should be which\nagent offers the most efficacy, along with the least amount of potential complications.\nHistorically, systemic anticoagulation using heparin has been most commonly prescribed in CRRT in adults and\nchildren. Unfractionated heparin exerts its effect by binding to antithrombin III (AT-3) and potentiating its\nendogenous inhibition of thrombin and other coagulation factors involved in the clotting cascade. The main\ndrawback of heparin is that it anticoagulates both the CRRT circuit and the patient, and thus may increase the\npatient’s risk of bleeding. Critically ill patients in the PICU may already be at risk of bleeding because of\ntrauma, surgery, or coagulopathy, and not surprisingly, bleeding events have been reported in 10% to 50% of\npatients receiving heparin anticoagulation. Regional anticoagulation of the CRRT circuit without systemic\nanticoagulation may be considered with the use of the heparin antagonist protamine given postfilter, but\ncirculating heparin-protamine complexes may also confer risk of thrombotic events to the patient.\nAnother feared adverse effect of unfractionated heparin is the development of heparin-induced\nthrombocytopenia (HIT). This is caused by the development of antibodies against a complex of heparin bound\nto platelet factor 4, which may then bind other platelets, resulting in a loss of circulating platelets. The\nprevalence of this adverse effect ranges from less than 1% to 5% depending on the patient population and type\nof heparin used, a far lower observed rate than with bleeding complications.\nHeparin has variable pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. First, heparin has been shown to induce the release of\nproinflammatory mediators from leukocytes and platelets. In addition, there is some evidence, primarily from in\nvitro experiments, that heparin may diminish anti-inflammatory effects of AT-3 and endothelial cells, so it\ncould have adverse effects on the microcirculation. Another potential safety concern with heparin regards its\nability to bind proteins such as immunoglobulins, which can further imperil the innate immune response.\nFinally, heparin has various anti-inflammatory properties, achieved via blocking of complement activation and\nthe reduction of circulating interleukins (interleukin-1β, -8, and nuclear factor-κB).\nAs heparin requires AT-3 to cause anti-coagulant effects, it may be less effective in conditions with low AT-3,\nsuch as nephrotic syndrome. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has less dependency on AT-3 to cause its\n\nanticoagulant effect and therefore may be considered a useful alternative in this scenario. However, LMWH still\nhas the same adverse effects of unfractionated heparin; they are just less pronounced. Some adult comparative\nstudies have utilized LMWH as a systemic anticoagulant, but they have also noted higher rates of bleeding\ncomplications (more than doubled) with the LMWH group. There is limited (if any) data on LMWH\nanticoagulation use in children requiring CRRT.\nThe other commonly used anticoagulant in CRRT is citrate. Citrate chelates calcium in the blood, making it\nunavailable for use in several steps of the clotting cascade, inhibiting the formation of thrombin. This would\nalso cause significant hypocalcemia in the patient, requiring that calcium be administered to the patient to avoid\nthis adverse effect. Thus, the use of citrate allows for regional (circuit only) and not systemic anticoagulation,\nwithout increasing the risk of bleeding as greatly as seen with heparin. However, there can be variation in citrate\nmetabolism with liver dysfunction or even poor tissue perfusion (as the Krebs cycle, which metabolizes citrate,\noperates under aerobic conditions) and citrate accumulation can occur. Oddly, this has the potential but\nunsubstantiated benefit of providing an additional source of energy for the Krebs cycle and may be protective\nfor some cells. Regardless, monitoring of the patient’s ionized calcium is essential and adjustments to the citrate\nor calcium infusion rates are often necessary to account for any hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia that occurs.\nCitrate accumulation also causes an increase in the serum total calcium as citrate-bound calcium increases and\nadditional calcium is replaced. A total to ionized calcium ratio (mg/dL divided by mg/dL) may be calculated in\npatients and ratios greater than 2.25 may be indicative of citrate accumulation.\nOther metabolic abnormalities can also be seen with use of citrate anticoagulation. Citrate may also act as a\nbuffer, as it may be converted into bicarbonate by the liver. In liver failure, this conversion may not occur and\nthe unmetabolized citrate may cause metabolic acidosis. However, in most cases, intact liver metabolism can\nlead to increased serum bicarbonate levels, and metabolic alkalosis may occur, especially if using alkalotic\ndialysate or replacement solutions. This metabolic effect is dependent on the citrate solution being used. In\nNorth America, there are 2 available citrate solutions for anticoagulation: trisodium citrate (TSC) and acid\ncitrate dextrose (ACD). The ACD solution has hydrogen as the cation to 30% of its citrate content, thus it has\nlower buffering capacity than TSC, which solely uses sodium as its cation and is less likely to cause metabolic\nalkalosis with normal citrate metabolism.\nCalcium is not the only divalent ion that citrates chelates, as both magnesium and phosphorus can be bound.\nIonized magnesium has been shown to decrease with citrate anticoagulation, while total magnesium levels may\nbe unaffected. However, magnesium is typically replaced via dialysate or replacement solutions in the setting of\nCRRT. Similarly, hypophosphatemia, which may occur from dialytic clearance of CRRT, may be exacerbated\nwith the chelating effects of citrate anticoagulation and there may be greater needs for phosphate\nsupplementation either through intravenous infusion or the dialysis solutions.\n\nOther electrolyte abnormalities can also be seen with the type of citrate solution being used. Trisodium citrate,\nas its name implies, contains 3 sodium cations matching its citrate content, giving it a sodium concentration of\n408 mmol/L. Hypernatremia has been associated with its use. Likewise, acid citrate dextrose, as its name\nimplies, contains dextrose at a concentration of 124 mmol/L (2.3 g/dL) and may provide a significant amount of\nadditional glucose to patients. Hyperglycemia often may result in patients with insulin resistance or deficiency,\nsuch as what is seen in the PICU setting.\nIt has been speculated but not yet proven that because the release of inflammatory mediators is dependent on\ncalcium, the development of hypocalcemia with citrate anticoagulation, if it occurs, may impede the\ninflammatory response.\nThere are no prospective studies comparing the 2 anticoagulation methods (systemic heparin versus regional\ncitrate) in the pediatric population, but there have been several studies in adults with 2 systematic reviews of\nthese comparisons. The 2 reviews, with slightly different methodologies, both identified a decreased risk of\nbleeding with the use of regional citrate. One review also noted an advantage of longer circuit survival with the\nuse of citrate, while the other did not. In one randomized, prospective study, systemic heparin was compared to\ncitrate anticoagulation in 48 adult patients with a lower risk for bleeding. Uncensored circuit survival and\nmedian clotting-free circuit survival were similar for both groups. No major bleeding events were recorded in\nthe citrate group, compared with 10 events in the heparin group (p < 0.01). The number of red blood cell units\ngiven per day of CVVH was significantly higher in the heparin group as well. Analysis of the pediatric CRRT\nregistry data showed that citrate and heparin have equivalent circuit survival, but the citrate group had lower\nbleeding risk.\nPREP Pearls\n The risk of bleeding complications secondary to the anticoagulation for CRRT is higher with systemic\nheparinization when compared to regional citrate anticoagulation, but there is still risk with each method.\n Citrate anticoagulation can be used safely in children needing CRRT, but requires vigilance to monitor ionized\ncalcium levels closely as both hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia can occur.\n Citrate anticoagulation can also be associated with other metabolic abnormalities, most commonly alkalosis,\nwhen excess citrate accumulates and is appropriately metabolized by the liver. Lower phosphate levels may be\nseen from the chelation effects of citrate. Also, depending on the brand of citrate being used, hypernatremia or\nhyperglycemia can also be seen.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the use of and complications of heparin, citrate, and other anticoagulation agents with CAVH-CVVH\ntreatment\n\nSuggested Readings\n Betjes MG, van Oosterom D, van Agteren M, van de Wetering J.

      "long loop of Henle Answer A Neonates can dilute their urine to nearly the adult level of about 50 mOsm/kg water, but the maximum urine osmolality of the human neonate is only about 400 to 600 (as seen in this patient) mOsm/kg of water. The adult kidney can achieve an osmolality of about 1,200 mOsm/kg of water and young children can achieve the adult osmolality values at about 1 to 2 years of age. Multiple developmental factors contribute to the limited ability of the neonate to generate a maximally concentrated urine. These factors include:  Decreased corticomedullary solute gradient  Decreased responsiveness to vasopressin due to decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production in the collecting duct  A short loop of Henle  Interference by prostaglandins During prenatal and postnatal maturation, there are anatomic changes that occur in the kidney which affect urinary concentration ability. There is a decrease in medullary interstitial connective tissue, an increased length of the thin limbs, and the tubules become more tightly packed. These anatomic changes are accompanied by increases in the medullary sodium and urea concentration, and these developmental changes are necessary for the counter current system to be maximally efficient. Principal cells in the collecting tubule and cells in the medullary collecting duct express aquaporin channels on the apical and basolateral membranes. Vasopressin normally synthesized and secreted by the pituitary binds to the vasopressin receptor (V2 receptor) in the basolateral membranes of the collecting duct principal cells. This stimulates production of cAMP, which triggers intracellular signals that result in the insertion of vesicles containing aquaporin 2, a water channel, into the apical membrane. This mechanism of increasing cAMP formation is attenuated in the neonatal kidney as compared to the adult kidney. Prostaglandin production by the collecting tubule attenuates the effects of vasopressin more in the neonatal kidney compared to the adult kidney. Limited urine concentrating ability increases the risk of volume depletion if intake is reduced or fluid loss is increased. Disease states that result in the inability to concentrate urine include central diabetes insipidus (defect in vasopressin secretion due to hypothalamic tumors, pituitary trauma, or neurosurgical procedures) and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (reduced ability of the kidney to respond to vasopressin due to inherited defects in the vasopressin V2 receptor or due to acquired damage to the collecting duct).

      "polyuria Answer B The gold standard for measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is inulin clearance; inulin is a physiologically inert substance that is freely filtered at the glomerulus. However, using this exogenous agent requires a continuous intravenous infusion and multiple blood samples. Other methods include creatinine clearance, iohexol clearance, and a dynamic renal diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DPTA) scan. However, none of these methods are practical for day-to-day renal function monitoring in clinical practice because of a need for intravenous access with or without timed urine collection. As a result, clinicians most often use an estimated GFR (eGFR) that is calculated from the serum creatinine. The National Kidney Foundation recommends that, in adults, eGFR be calculated automatically each time serum creatinine is performed and reporting results when the eGFR is less than 60 mL/min per 1.73m2. In pediatric patients, the eGFR is calculated from the height and serum creatinine using the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) formula, which is the suggested eGFR formula that replaced the previous Schwartz formula. Utilization of the eGFR is limited by the fact that serum creatinine can be altered by several factors other than true GFR. Factors that can overestimate or underestimate true GFR include:  Increased muscle mass with increased serum creatinine as occurs in athletes or decreased muscle mass with decreased serum creatinine due to malnutrition, muscle wasting disease, or amputations  Increased or decreased daily protein intake  Use of creatine supplements  Increase in serum creatinine due to decreased tubular secretion of creatinine by medications such as trimethoprim, cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine  Vegetarian diet resulting in a low serum creatinine  The method of serum creatinine determination such as the Jaffe method verses newer enzymatic methods Estimated GFRs are commonly used to stage and classify chronic kidney disease (CKD) in pediatric patients. The CKiD formula is the suggested eGFR formula for use in children. The Schwartz equation is based on serum creatinine determined by a Jaffe method, and use of the Schwartz equation may provide an overestimate of the GFR if there is an enzymatic determination of serum creatinine. The enzymatic method for determining creatinine results is a lower value compared with the Jaffe method. The updated CKiD formula for estimating GFR is as follows: GFR = 0.413 X height in cm/serum creatinine in mg/dL (enzymatic determination) However, the CKiD equation based on creatinine and height was derived from a cohort of children with CKD who had a mean measured GFR of 40 mL/min per 1.73m2. Thus, the formula may not be accurate in children with a higher GFR. In addition, the cohort contained fewer older adolescents and the formula may not be accurate for adolescents whose muscle mass is higher; this is a particular concern for male adolescents. Additionally, this method of eGFR estimation by the CKiD formula has not been validated in patients with edema. Of the healthy adolescents who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 9% had an eGFR less than 100 mL/min per 1.73 m2, but they did not exhibit higher morbidities (associated with CKD) than those who had a GFR greater than 100 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Studies have shown that, in the lower GFR range in younger children, the CKiD equation performed accurately. However, children younger than 2 years of age do not fit within the KDIGO CKD classification system (described later in this critique) because they normally have a lower GFR even when corrected for body surface area. Chronic kidney disease staging guides management by stratifying the risk for progression and complications of CKD. Risk stratification guides the use and timing of intervention and the intensity of monitoring. The KDIGO guideline classifies the severity of CKD for patients older than 2 years of age based on eGFR as follows: ●G1 – Normal GFR (≥90 mL/min per 1.73 m2) ●G2 – GFR between 60 and 89 mL/min per 1.73 m2 ●G3a – GFR between 45 and 59 mL/min per 1.73 m2 ●G3b – GFR between 30 and 44 mL/min per 1.73m2 ●G4 – GFR between 15 and 29 mL/min per 1.73 m2 ●G5 – GFR of less than 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (kidney failure) Blood pressure, obesity, physical activity, and polyuria are incorrect because they do not directly interfere with eGFR determinations. In obesity, weight gain is mostly caused by fat accumulation and does not increase serum creatinine. PREP Pearls  Estimated glomerular filtration rate is accurate in young children with a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  Estimated glomerular filtration rate underestimates GFR in adolescents older than 16 years of age and in children and adolescents with normal GFR.

      "primary cells in culture have a long life span and can be passaged indefinitely Answer C Cell culture, sometimes referred to as tissue culture, refers to the process by which cells are dispersed in vitro in an environment composed of nutrient solutions, a suitable surface to support the growth of cells, and ideal conditions of temperature, humidity, and gaseous atmosphere. In such a controlled system, a biologist can precisely measure the cell’s response to drugs, environmental changes, carcinogenic agents, and viruses. Cultured cells can be transfected using recombinant DNA technology, and thereby induced to produce recombinant proteins, enzymes, and hormone replacement therapy. In addition, primary cells, such as fibroblasts, can be taken from a patient with a defined genetic mutation, such as cystinosis, and propagated in culture to make the correct biochemical diagnosis or to record the response to new treatments. More recently, dermal fibroblasts and other cell types were harvested from animals or patients with specific genetic diseases, cultured in vitro, dedifferentiated into stem cells, followed by precise correction of the genetic mutation. The genetically corrected stem cells are then redirected to differentiate into target cells (eg, pancreatic β cells). The long-term goal is to generate personalized cell-based therapy of disease. When cells are grown to confluence in the culture dish, contact inhibition occurs as cell-cell contact slows down proliferation considerably. Passaging the cells, ie, removing the cells and reculturing them at a lower seeding cell number, can reverse this proliferation defect. Most cells will stop dividing after 20 to 30 cell divisions, a process called cellular senescence, mediated by the retinoblastoma and p53 tumor suppressors. This process is normally irreversible, even with the addition of growth factors. Cells that are cultured directly from a subject are known as primary cells. With the exception of some derived from tumors, most primary cell cultures have limited lifespan. An established or immortalized cell line has acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely either through random mutation or deliberate modification, such as artificial expression of the telomerase gene or the SV40 T-antigen. Like cancer cells, these cells are transformed, and therefore their genome and epigenome are altered. PREP Pearls  Cell culture is a useful tool for disease diagnosis, drug testing, production of recombinant enzymes and hormones, and stem cell-based therapy.  Although primary cultures reflect the biological properties of the host, they tend to have a short life span.  Immortalized or established cell lines are frequently used in the laboratory and offer an efficient means to test the mechanisms of action and adverse effects of drugs, as well as the direct effect of genetic mutation on cellular survival and metabolism.

      "MUC1 gene mutation",
      "NPHP1 gene mutation Answer E This patient has an urine concentration defect with slightly small echogenic kidneys, elevated creatinine, and a history of polyuria. At this age, the most likely cause is a form of nephronophthisis, which is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with defects in any of 20 genes. The progression of disease is often slow and nonspecific, and an early manifestation is a concentration defect in otherwise normal urine (polydipsia and polyuria). As the disease progresses, the kidneys may become smaller and hyperechoic with corticomedullary cysts, associated with hypertension, anemia, and growth failure (the latter two typically out of proportion to the renal dysfunction). Renal biopsy is nonspecific with tubular atrophy, tubular basement membrane thinning, tubular interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation. The underlying defect in nephronophthisis is a ciliopathy. Primary cilia are immotile hair-like organelles present on renal tubular cells and most cells throughout the body. Genetic changes that disrupt normal primary cilia function in the tubular cells in the kidney can lead to a wide range of cystic kidney disease (autosomal dominant and recessive polycystic kidney disease, tuberous sclerosis, etc). The genes in nephronophthisis are involved in ciliary function. Only about one-third of patients have an identified gene defect and, because many patients have microdeletions, sequencing alone will not suffice to make a genetic diagnosis. The most common gene defect in nephronophthisis, NPHP1, accounts for 20% of patients and these patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at a mean of 13 years of age. Since cilia are expressed throughout the body, other organs may be affected. A defect in the eye may be present in NPHP1 patients (retinitis pigmentosa in 10% and oculomotor apraxia in 2%). The remaining nephronophthisis genes are responsible for the remaining 13% to 15% of patients with identified gene defects (two-thirds of patients do not have an identified gene defect). Thus, it is important to recognize the nonrenal manifestations of nephronophthisis to provide appropriate care and avoid unnecessary procedures such as renal biopsy, which is not very helpful in diagnosis. Overall, extrarenal symptoms may be present in up to 20% of patients and may be syndromic. The Table lists some syndromes associated with nephronophthisis genes. The wide ranging and overlapping organ involvement in the various genetic forms of nephronophthisis is partially explained by interactions between nephronophthisis gene products (NPHP 1-4-6 gene products form a module that is localized to the cilary transition zone and cell-cell contacts, and is thought to be important in cell polarization/organization), involvement in common pathways (NPHP 2-3-4 gene products may interact with the Wnt signaling pathway), and other non-cilia functions of these genes (NPHP 15 [centrosomal protein 164] regulates DNA damage response, and the former function may lead to the fibrotic progression seen in nephronopthisis). In the US Renal Data System (USRDS), nephronophthisis accounts for less than 2% of ESRD in children, whereas in Europe over 10% of childhood ESRD is attributed to nephronophthisis. This difference may be in large part due to under recognition in the United States. In this case, the normal-to-small-sized kidneys and lack of drug history make a drug induced acute interstitial nephritis unlikely, however, the chronic interstitial fibrotic changes and inflammation seen in nephronophthisis may be mistaken for a chronic interstitial nephritis. Medullary cystic kidney disease is an autosomal dominant form of tubulointerstitial nephropathy. The renal manifestations are similar to nephronophthisis, except with the addition of hyperuricemia and an adult presentation with progression to ESRD in adult life in most cases. Patients have no extrarenal involvement. Medullary cystic kidney disease type 1 is caused by mutations in the MUC1 gene and the median age of ESRD is in the sixth decade of life. Medullary cystic kidney disease type 2 is caused by mutations in the UMOD gene and ESRD occurs usually in the third decade of life. Cadmium nephrotoxicity usually lags a decade after chronic exposure and is associated with progressive renal tubular dysfunction (glycosuria, tubular proteinuria, calcium and phosphorus wasting). Most studies suggest a latency period of a decade before clinically evident renal damage. However, renal cortical necrosis has been reported after acute high-dose exposure in humans. AVPR2 or vasopressin receptor mutations can cause diabetes insipidus consistent with the polyuria and polydipsia in these patients. Progression of renal insufficiency can be seen in poorly controlled patients due to progressive urinary tract dilatation/obstruction, or in treated patients due to complications of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug use. This patient’s clinical presentation is not consistent with a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus.

Pathologically, RPGN is classified into: a) anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease, b) pauci-immune or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-related disease, and c) immune complex disease. Timely recognition and treatment of RPGN is required because irreversible scarring can occur within weeks. The gold standard for diagnosis of RPGN is renal biopsy. Diagnosis and treatment in the setting of concomitant pulmonary involvement is a medical emergency because patients may rapidly decompensate to respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Rapid evaluation and renal biopsy is important in the setting of a pulmonary renal syndrome because renal biopsy is contraindicated on ECMO due to anticoagulation. Many forms of glomerulonephritis may present as RPGN (Table 1). Serologic evaluation of RPGN with ANCA, antiproteinase 3 (PR3), antimyeloperoxidase (MPO), and anti-GBM will help distinguish between the various diseases (Table 2). Clinically and serologically, there can be overlap and renal biopsy is the gold standard. On renal biopsy, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis will show a pauci-immune pattern, whereas anti-GBM will show linear staining of the glomerular basement membrane with anti-immunoglobulin G on indirect immunofluorescence. The patient in the vignette presents with renal failure of uncertain timeframe, fluid overload, hypertension, and respiratory signs and symptoms. The differential includes progression of a chronic renal disease or acute/subacute renal failure. The renal ultrasonography is a helpful study to assess for a chronic renal disease and to rule out any component of postrenal obstructive process or anatomic contraindications for a potential renal biopsy. Other studies that may be useful to assess for chronicity of renal failure may be the presence of significant anemia and grossly elevated intact parathyroid hormone assay. In patients with acute renal failure and respiratory symptoms, it is important to assess for the presence of fluid overload or a pulmonary-renal syndrome. In this patient, a chest radiograph would be indicated during the initial evaluation. Chest computed tomography would not be indicated in a patient with chest radiograph findings of only fluid overload. Radiological findings of pulmonary renal syndrome include patchy opacities, hilar adenopathy, nodules, and pulmonary infiltrates. In the setting of glomerulonephritis, the complement component 3 level will help segregate a low complement glomerulonephritis (postinfectious glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and infectious endocarditis or shunt nephritis). Postinfectious glomerulonephritis is commonly caused by a streptococcal infection. The antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer may be used as evidence to support a preceding streptococcal infection, but shows poor sensitivity to skin infections or pharyngitis with early antibiotic therapy. The streptozyme is a superior test that detects antibodies to streptococcal antigens nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-hydrolyzing enzyme (NADase), DNAase, streptokinase, streptolysin O, and hyaluronidase. Henoch-Schönlein purpura and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy may present with RPGN and sometimes pulmonary involvement. Diagnosis is clinical, unless renal biopsy is performed and measurement of IgA levels is not informative. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is a biomarker used to detect acute kidney injury and would add no value in the workup of this patient. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is a heterogeneous group of diseases that is difficult to study. Overall, early control of inflammation with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide is advised. For diseases that are mediated by circulating antibodies or immune complexes, (ANCA-associated vasculitis, anti-GBM disease) plasmapheresis may be used in conjunction with steroids and cyclophosphamide, and can be lifesaving. Anti-B-cell therapy has also been advocated for ANCA- associated vasculitis and anti-GBM disease, but its role in the treatment of RPGN (adjunctive versus primary therapy) has not been defined by clinical trials.

      "presence of immunoglobulin M in the mesangium by immunofluorescence Answer A By definition, there are no or minimal glomerular changes by light microscopy in minimal change disease (MCD). As with any cause of nephrotic syndrome, protein droplets may be seen in the cytoplasm of podocytes or tubular cells. Occasionally, there may be podocyte hypertrophy. Cellularity is normal in most of cases, although variants show slight mesangial hypercellularity. Slight mesangial hypercellularity or immunoglobulin M (IgM) deposits may be associated with reduced steroid responsiveness. There may be glomerular global scleroses in less than 10% of glomeruli. In children, any segmental glomerular lesion or interstitial fibrosis or tubular atrophy should raise the possibility of another diagnosis, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). In normal adults, one may find small areas of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy; these changes in adults do not preclude a diagnosis of MCD. The vascular compartment is normal in MCD. Immunoglobulins and complement fractions are usually not present by immunofluorescence. In some instances, there may be mesangial deposits of IgM or C1q that may have pathogenic implications and influence clinical outcome. The diagnostic ultrastructural changes by electron microscopy are loss of podocyte processes and slit-diaphragms are not identified. This finding is called “effacement,” “fusion,” or “simplification” of podocyte processes. The change that results in this finding is due to disordered epithelial cell structure with withdrawal of the dendritic processes. The cytoplasm of podocytes displays long and narrow prolongations from its surface: “microvillus transformation.” Podocyte alteration is usually diffuse, but it may also be focal in nature. There is no consistent correlation between the degree of ultrastructural injury and the severity of proteinuria. The ultrastructural changes normalize when there is response to therapy. Although mesangial expansion may be seen as a variant in MCD, it is not a diagnostic feature. The presence of mesangial expansion may be associated with a greater likelihood of steroid dependence or resistance. The presence of intense or diffuse mesangial deposits of IgM is also associated with a greater likelihood of steroid resistance. Many patients with mesangial deposits of IgM display mesangial hypercellularity. Some consider IgM nephropathy as a separate disease, while others feel that it is a variant of MCD or FSGS. On the other hand, C1q glomerulopathy is associated with intense diffuse mesangial C1q deposition by immunofluorescence. There may be mesangial deposits of other immunoglobulins and complement fractions. Histologic features vary and include minimal changes to mesangial cell proliferation or focal and segmental sclerosis (FSGS). The usual clinical presentation is nephrotic syndrome that is partially responsive or is not responsive to steroid therapy. Some patients may develop end-stage renal disease. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) nephropathy and C3 mesangial nephropathy are identified by diffuse mesangial deposits of IgG or C3. Immunoglobulin G nephropathy (or mesangial IgG glomerulonephritis) has been described in patients presenting with hematuria and proteinuria with or without overt nephrotic syndrome. Due to the small number of reported cases, the prognosis is not certain, but some patients may develop progressive kidney disease. Typically, children with MCD first present before 6 years of age, are steroid responsive in 90% of cases, and do not require a kidney biopsy. In this vignette, indications for the kidney biopsy include older age, African-American descent, and steroid resistance. However, it should be noted that, even among steroid-resistant cases, approximately 25% will still display only the histologic findings of MCD.

Most cases are inherited in an X-linked pattern, although some cases are autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant. De novo anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis is usually associated with the presence of circulating immunoglboulin G (IgG) antibodies to the noncollagenous domain of α3 type IV collagen, manifesting as linear IgG deposition along the GBM on immunofluorescence staining. These patients develop hematuria, proteinuria, and end-stage renal disease. Therapeutic options for patients with Alport syndrome are limited. Blood pressure needs to be monitored carefully and treated appropriately when high. Angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/ARBs, apart from being potent antihypertensive agents, and can be used for their antiproteinuric effect and alleviation of tubulointerstitial inflammation/fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. These medications may cause a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increase in serum potassium that need to be monitored. Some reports suggest that cyclosporine A may be helpful, but concerns remain about its nephrotoxic effects after prolonged use, which may accelerate interstitial fibrosis. Alport syndrome patients also have progressive sensorineural hearing deficit and refractive errors due to anterior lenticonus, and both need regular monitoring and appropriate interventions. After patients with Alport syndrome receive renal transplants, post-transplant anti-GBM nephritis occurs in 3% to 5% of them. The GBM of patients with Alport syndrome lacks α3α4 α5(IV) trimers. Post-transplant anti-GBM nephritis is an allogeneic response to antigens present in the transplanted kidney but absent in the native kidneys of the Alport recipient. In X-linked Alport syndrome, target alloantibodies are to the α5(IV) noncollagenous 1 domain primarily. Commercial assays are relatively insensitive to anti-α5(IV) antibodies. Treatment of post-transplant anti-GBM disease in Alport syndrome remains a challenge and includes immunosuppressive agents and plasmapheresis. Characterization of anti-GBM autoepitopes and alloepitopes reveals differences in the supramolecular structure of the antigen and accessibility of the tissues. The alloepitope is more accessible within NC1 hexamers than the partially sequestered Goodpasture autoepitopes. A better understanding of the alloepitopes in post- transplant nephritis may help to create therapies to restore tolerance to the normal α3α4α5(IV) collagen.

His iron stores reveal a serum iron of 180\nμg/dL (32.2 μmol/L), total iron binding capacity of 304 μg/dL (54.4 μmol/L), and serum ferritin of 2,017 ng/mL. The patient is diagnosed as having iron overload.\nOf the following, the MOST accurate statement about iron overload in hemodialysis patients is",
    "options": [
      "it is associated with greater parenchymal tissue toxicity in the last 25 years since the advent of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent and intravenous iron use",
      "it is prevalent almost universally in hemodialysis patients who are given 1 gram of intravenous iron per year",
      "it is treated effectively with intravenous desferoxamine, especially in patients with residual renal function",
      "risk of infection is increased secondary to direct toxic effects on the bone marrow and leukopenia",
      "transferrin saturation (TSAT) of less than 25% indicates more severe toxicity Answer C Iron is very tightly regulated within the body because it is essential for health, but can be highly toxic when present in excess. It is primarily utilized for its oxygen- carrying capacity on erythrocytes, but is also needed for cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. However, iron has oxidative properties that may generate hydroxyl radicals that cause tissue injury when not properly bound. Therefore, the body has highly conserved mechanisms to strictly control its release. Ferroportin, hepcidin, transferrin, and ferritin help regulate iron’s absorption, transport, and release within the body, and mechanisms that bypass these controls can cause iron deficiency or overload. In adults, the total amount of iron in the body is about 2.5 to 3 g, with about one-third of all iron reserves stored as ferritin. Normal iron turnover is about 1 to 2 mg each day, with normal absorption and losses via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with the losses due to a regular sloughing of GI tract cells. Under normal conditions, iron deficiency decreases hepcidin levels, which increases ferroportin levels in enterocytes in the duodenum, and thus allowing greater iron absorption from the GI tract. On the other hand, iron repletion causes the reverse, an increase in hepcidin associated with a decrease in ferroportin levels, resulting in a decrease in iron absorption. Transferrin is an iron-binding plasma glycoprotein that transfers iron from the intestine to the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) and from the RES to the bone marrow. Ferritin is a protein that helps store iron in nontoxic form in the RES and serum ferritin is often a direct correlate of intracellular ferritin levels. Thus, ferritin is a reflection of iron stores, though other factors (inflammation, liver disease) can affect its serum levels. Hepcidin and ferroportin also control transport of iron outside of the RES. Since iron is a cofactor for microbial growth, the body sequesters iron in the RES when an infection is present. Therefore, chronic inflammation, as with chronic kidney disease (CKD), alters the levels of hepcidin (increases) and, subsequently, the normal distribution of iron. Patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) have greater losses of blood, and thus iron, secondary to more scheduled laboratory draws, hemodialyzer and tubing losses, surgical procedures, and GI losses. It is estimated that the average adult HD patient will lose 1,000 to 3,000 mg of iron each year, far exceeding the normal absorption of the GI tract. Therefore, a greater amount of iron replacement is needed with HD, up to 1 g/year, to avoid iron deficiency. Prior to the advent of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) use in the late 1980s, most patients on HD required repeated transfusions of packed red blood cells. Each transfusion meant an additional 200 to 250 mg of iron to the patient. As a result, iron overload and toxicity was common and the only ways to decrease iron levels were the avoidance of transfusions, the use of chelating agents, or via phlebotomy (ie, bloodletting). With the discovery of ESAs, increasing erythropoiesis became another way to treat iron overload and the prevalence of iron overload and toxicity decreased while anemia management simplified. However, with concerns about cost and potential adverse effects of ESAs, intravenous (IV) iron use increased as a means of lowering ESA total doses. Since IV iron may also overwhelm the meticulous control of the body’s ligating proteins, there has been increasing concern about a resurgence of iron overload and toxicity with greater use of IV iron agents. In patients with hemochromatosis, iron has been shown to deposit in bones (causing bone loss and arthropathy), liver (cirrhosis), heart (failure), and endocrine organs (diabetes, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism). Iron overload has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The oxidizing effect of free iron may act synergistically with low-density lipoproteins (LDL); increased iron content and oxidation products are seen in atherosclerotic plaques, and carotid intimal thickness has been directly correlated with annual dose of IV iron. Inhibition of vascular relaxation (endothelial dysfunction) has also been seen both in vitro and in vivo with use of IV iron sucrose. Additionally, the risk of infection with iron overload is not solely from its availability to bacteria for growth. Iron uptake by lymphocytes leads to inhibited proliferation and their depletion, particularly of CD-4 positive T cells. Intravenous iron has also been shown to directly impair the phagocytic ability of neutrophils. The organ system that is most affected by iron overload is liver, with 70% to 90% of total iron stores found in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Iron concentration in the liver is considered the best indicator of systemic iron overload. In patients with hemochromatosis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of liver is the gold standard for evaluating body iron content. Studies in HD patients have shown increased liver iron concentrations, with even low-risk patients having levels indicating moderate to severe overload. However, despite the evidence of increased liver deposition of iron, there have been no reported cases of cirrhosis in patients receiving only parenteral iron. Studies of IV iron in animal subjects have similarly lacked the development of cirrhosis. It is felt that excess iron is being stored in the RES and not in the liver parenchyma so that liver function is unaffected. Historically, HD patients receiving blood transfusions would develop cirrhosis, and it is now thought that this may be secondary to the development of hepatitis B or C and not entirely from iron overload. Liver iron concentration on MRI has been found to correlate best with serum ferritin levels, therefore ferritin may be used to establish thresholds in which to investigate further for evidence of iron overload. However, transferrin saturation (TSAT) may also be helpful in evaluating the risk of toxicity. In studies of other iron overload disorders, TSAT is often in the normal range when iron accumulates in the RES, while elevated TSAT values (mainly with elevated serum iron levels) have been seen with iron deposition in the liver parenchyma. Additionally, when the TSAT is greater than 70%, there is an increased risk of a toxic fraction of free plasma iron appearing, which can cause free radical production and oxidative injury to other tissues. As mentioned before, the treatment of iron overload is through removal of iron either via blood loss or use of chelating agents. Use of ESAs has allowed for iron utilization out of ferritin stores (as serum ferritin decreases in overloaded patients who start using ESAs), which can then be removed from the body through the normal blood loss of HD (laboratory draws, trapping in filters and tubing). Prior to ESA availability, iron chelators would be administered to bind iron and allow for its removal via urinary or fecal clearance. Desferoxamine (DFO), given as subcutaneous or IV injection, has been used for many decades in the treatment of iron overload. One of its main drawbacks was its IV administration; however, this can be ideally suited in patients requiring HD as it may be administered during treatment. Desferoxamine does have a short half-life, so it is preferably given as a continuous infusion, however, it is also dialyzable, so it will have decreased efficacy when given during an HD treatment, and therefore increased doses may be needed. An oral chelating agent, deferasirox, is being used increasingly for iron overload due to excessive blood transfusions, as it is more easily administered and has a longer half-life. However, deferasirox can have deleterious effects on the kidney, and is not recommended for use in patients with decreased renal function. However, in patients already on HD with very limited residual renal function, it has been used effectively to treat iron overload. The use of chelating agents, mainly DFO, has been shown to minimize the cardiac and vascular toxicity of iron overload over time. Iron deficiency is more commonly seen in CKD, especially after the initiation of ESA use when iron demands are increased with greater erythropoiesis. The evaluation of iron status should include a ferritin and TSAT levels. The TSAT is the measure of iron immediately available for hemoglobin synthesis as the fraction of iron bound to transferrin and can be a highly specific predictor of iron deficiency in pediatric CKD patients. Serum ferritin reflects total iron body stores and a low serum ferritin level has been shown to be a specific predictor of iron deficiency in pediatric CKD. However, ferritin is also an acute phase reactant and may be elevated in the face of systemic inflammation or malnutrition. Therefore, ferritin may be compromised in its ability to serve as a reliable measure of iron status when its value is elevated. The target serum ferritin level in the absence of inflammation is greater than 100 ng/mL (224.7 pmol/L). The distinguishing features of “absolute iron deficiency” (low serum iron levels from insufficient total body iron) from the “functional iron deficiency” of inflammation (low serum iron because it is trapped in the RES) can be difficult to separate and may require deeper investigation. Some have cited using elevated ferritin levels as one way to distinguish between the two, however, there is no absolute cut-off value of ferritin that can make this distinction. The treatments of “absolute” and “functional iron deficiency” should be different. Absolute iron deficiency is best treated with iron supplementation, either enterally or parenterally. The treatment of “functional iron deficiency” would be to control inflammation, which is much less straightforward in some conditions. If the primary etiology of kidney disease is an inflammatory disease (eg, lupus nephritis), then better disease control with the use of appropriate immunosuppressants may be indicated. Other mechanisms to control inflammation have included correction of vitamin D (associated with lower hepcidin levels) or use of anti-oxidants. PREP Pearls  Direct infusion of iron into the bloodstream, via intravenous iron or blood transfusion, places patients at risk for iron overload, as it bypasses the body’s highly conserved mechanisms of iron influx and efflux.  Intravenous iron products can lead to iron overload, so their use should be tightly monitored, especially in conditions of functional iron deficiency where total body iron is sufficient and ferritin levels are elevated. However, there has not been an increase in liver parenchyma.  Iron overload can increase both cardiovascular (atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction) and infectious (lymphocyte depletion, phagocytic impairment) risk in hemodialysis patients, who already have increased risk for both.

    "explanation": "E. polysulfone membrane, high-flux, surface area of 1.9 m2\nThe patient in this vignette, weighing 90 kg, requires a large surface area dialysis membrane (1.9 m2). Patients\nlike her with diabetes and hypoalbuminemia display significantly improved mortality and morbidity when high-\nflux membranes are used. A maximally biocompatible membrane such as polysulfone (PS) is preferred to other\nless compatible membranes (like cellulose), or those that carry a risk of intradialytic hypotension that can be\naggravated by her use of lisinopril (like AN-69). Therefore, the preferred response choice is E.\nThe performance of a dialyzer membrane is dependent on its biocompatibility and its effectiveness in solute\nclearance. Therefore, understanding the unique qualities of the different membranes is essential in making the\nappropriate selection of dialyzers for certain clinical situations.\nBiocompatibility refers to the ability, or more accurately the inability, of the membrane to activate the immune\nsystem and inflammatory response when blood comes into contact with it. All membranes have some potential\nto activate the immune system, but unmodified cellulose-based membranes that are composed of repeating\npolysaccharides similar in structure to bacterial wall lipopolysaccharides are much more prone to causing an\ninflammatory reaction. Blood coming into contact with an incompatible membrane stimulates complement\nactivation via the alternate pathway, which in turn, leads to anaphylatoxin (C3a) production. This can cause a\nvariety of intradialytic responses ranging from allergic reactions or acute pulmonary hypertension to transient\nleukopenia or platelet activation within the membrane. Chronic low-grade systemic inflammation is likely\ngreater with use of less biocompatible membranes. As the risk of significant reaction is unpredictable, several\ninternational dialysis guidelines (United States: K/DOQI; United Kingdom, Europe, Australia: CARI)\ndiscourage the use of unmodified cellulose membranes because of their potential for bioincompatibility. For this\nreason, response choice A would not be considered appropriate.\nThe evolution of dialyzer membranes saw alterations to cellulose, often replacing the hydroxyl (-OH) moieties\nwith acetate or amine (-NH2) moieties, making modified cellulose membranes more biocompatible. Synthetic\nmembranes, like polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyamide, polyethersulfone, and PS, are polymers of other chemical\ncompounds that are more biocompatible and also less frequently cause bioincompatibility reactions. Modified\ncellulose and synthetic membranes are thought to be equivalent in their biocompatibility, while synthetic\nmembranes may better adsorb some inflammatory response components and cause less overall activation. The\nAN-69 membranes, as a polymer of PAN and methanesulfonate, have a negatively charged surface area and, as\nsuch, may activate bradykinin more readily when blood comes into contact with it. This potentially may cause\nhypotension after dialysis initiation, which can be aggravated by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme\n(ACE) inhibitors. As the patient in this scenario is taking ACE inhibitors for hypertension and diabetic\n\nnephropathy, it would be more appropriate for her to remain on the medication and avoid the use of an AN-69\nmembrane (and the concomitant risk of bioincompatibility), making response choice C incorrect.\nThe dialysis membrane is able to remove solute through diffusion, convection, and adsorption. The clearance of\nsmall molecules, like urea, is more dependent on diffusive transport. It is measured by the mass transfer\ncoefficient of area, K A, which is calculated in vitro for different dialyzer membrane types at different flow\no\nrates. The K A is the product of the filter material’s capacity to allow small molecules to pass across it, the mass\no\ntransfer coefficient (K ), and the surface area (A) of the membrane. High-efficiency membranes are defined as\no\nhaving a K A of urea greater than or equal to 600 mL/min. In smaller children, the choice of hemodialysis (HD)\no\nfilter may be dependent on its surface area, along with the size of tubing used, in order to prevent an excessive\namount of total blood volume to be extracorporeal during a given treatment. In larger patients, the filter’s\nsurface area may also be important in determining the clearance of urea and the ability to achieve adequate\nclearance during a single treatment. For this scenario, with a patient weighing 90 kg, a larger surface area\nmembrane is desired to achieve adequate diffusive clearance, so a small surface area membrane, like response\nchoice D, would be less appropriate.\nConvective clearance of a membrane is measured by its ability to clear middle molecules, like β-2\nmicroglobulin. This can now be measured in membranes, but previously, this seemed to correlate with the\nmembrane’s permeability to water or ultrafiltration coefficient (K ). Newer synthetic membranes often had\nuf\nlarger pores allowing for the easier passage of fluid and larger molecules. The term high-flux, which previously\nreferred to membranes with high K values (> 14 mL/min per mm Hg), now refers to membranes with\nuf\nclearances of β-2 microglobulin greater than 20 mL/min. The advantages of improved β-2 microglobulin\ninclude reduction of amyloidosis and related issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome and arthropathy. A\nCochrane Review from 2005, based on more than 3,800 adult HD patients, could not determine overall efficacy\nor safety of high-flux compared to low-flux HD. However, in some recent comparison trials, there have been\nimproved outcomes with high-flux HD seen in certain populations.\nIn the hemodialysis (HEMO) study conducted in the United States, high-flux dialysis was associated with\ndecreased mortality from cardiac causes but not all-cause mortality. However, patients with longer HD vintage\n(more than 3.7 years) had improved cardiac and cerebrovascular morbidity with high-flux HD compared to low-\nflux treatments. In the Membrane Permeability Outcome (MPO) study in Europe, patients receiving high-flux\nHD had a 24% improvement in overall survival, which did not reach statistical significance. However, in\npatients with diabetes or serum albumin levels less than 4 g/dL (40 g/L), high-flux HD provided a significant\noverall survival advantage compared to low-flux HD. Other studies have shown improvement in lipid profiles in\npatients dialyzed with high flux membranes. Therefore, high-flux membranes may not be requisite for all HD\npatients, but patients with diabetes or low albumin levels may benefit from their use. As the patient listed in this\n\nvignette is both diabetic and hypoalbuminemic, a low-flux membrane listed in response choice B would be\nconsidered less appropriate.\nThere are other potential advantages of different filter materials and designs, with technological advances being\nmade regularly. Differences in copolymers can alter some of the properties of the filter, allowing for different\nhydrophilic and adsorptive qualities. The coating of an AN-69 filter with a polycationic polymer, termed an\nAN-69 ST membrane, decreases its negative charge and its ability to activate bradykinin. Polysulfone may be\npaired with varying amounts of different copolymers, giving different characteristics to each type of membrane.\nRecently, vitamin E has been used as a coating to cellulose and PS membranes to help reduce reactive oxygen\nspecies generation. Vitamin E-coated membranes have been associated with a reduction of inflammatory\nmarkers and hypotension, but have not yet shown to provide overall better survival. Also, thinner fibers and the\nability to have a rippled fiber pattern, as seen in newer synthetic membranes, allows for more uniform\ndistribution of dialysate flow and is believed to decrease risk of thrombosis. The Table shows advantages and\ndisadvantages of the most common dialyzers used in children.\nTable.

Laboratory tests reveal hypokalemic\nmetabolic alkalosis with low plasma renin activity and low serum aldosterone. He also appears to have a urinary\nconcentrating defect and microscopic hematuria. This constellation of symptoms is most consistent with\napparent mineralocorticoid excess, making response choice D the preferred response.\nApparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) is an autosomal recessive condition in which the enzyme responsible\nfor metabolizing cortisol to cortisone (11-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2) is inactivated. Under usual\ncircumstances, cortisol is 100 times more abundant in the plasma than aldosterone. Cortisol binds to the\nmineralocorticoid receptor as avidly as aldosterone, whereas cortisone does not bind to the mineralocorticoid\nreceptor. As such, with inactivation of 11-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, there is more cortisol\navailable in the plasma and the mineralocorticoid receptor remains activated. Affected individuals, therefore,\nmanifest all the signs and symptoms of primary aldosteronism (hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis,\nlow plasma renin activity), except instead of having an elevated plasma aldosterone, those with AME have a\nlow plasma aldosterone. With an activated mineralocorticoid receptor, there is increased sodium reabsorption at\nthe expense of potassium and hydrogen ions, which explains some of the laboratory findings. The hypokalemia\ncan lead to polyuria (hypokalemia-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) and muscle weakness. Occasionally,\naffected individuals will also have hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis; the mechanism for these findings is\nunknown. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess often presents with a severe phenotype in infancy and early\nchildhood, however milder phenotypes can present in adolescence and adulthood.\nSince 11-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 is inactivated in this syndrome, individuals have an abnormal\nratio of cortisol to cortisone metabolites, which can be measured via a timed urinary collection for cortisol and\ncortisone. Specifically, one measures (tetrahydrocortisol + allotetrahydrocortisol): tetrahydrocortisone ratio. A\nratio of 0.3 to 0.5 is normal. With AME, the cortisone is very low or undetectable, which results in a markedly\nelevated ratio.\nThe other choices for testing would not be indicated with the presentation of the infant in the vignette. While the\ninfant was certainly hypertensive, renal artery stenosis would not explain his constellation of symptoms and lab\nabnormalities. A defect in CYP11B2 is the cause of glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, but affected\nindividuals should have high aldosterone, not low aldosterone as in the vignette. Finally, mutations in WNK4\nare associated with Gordon syndrome, which usually presents with hyperkalemia, a hyperchloremic metabolic\nacidosis, and an elevated aldosterone.\n\nPREP Pearls\n Serum aldosterone can help differentiate between multiple causes of low-renin hypertension.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the clinical and laboratory features of apparent mineralocorticoid excess\nSuggested Readings\n Knops NB, Monnens LA, Lenders JW, Levtchenko EN.

Dharnidharka, MD\nOther causes of early-onset nephrotic syndrome can include infections (syphilis, toxoplasmosis) or toxins such\nas mercury exposure.\nIn the vignette, the presentation of nephrotic syndrome and elevated serum creatinine at 8 months of age in a\nfemale infant with streak ovaries should immediately raise suspicion of Denys-Drash syndrome. This condition\nis characterized by mutations in exon 8 or exon 9 of the Wilms tumor predisposing gene (WT1) on chromosome\n11p13. Patients may present with infantile nephrotic syndrome, renal failure, or Wilms tumor. Examination\nreveals either normal female external genitalia or ambiguous genitalia, but not normal male genitalia. Karyotype\nis either 46XY with female phenotype or 46XX. The gonads (testes or ovaries) are severely hypoplastic, seen as\n“streak” gonads on imaging. Renal pathology shows diffuse mesangial sclerosis.\nOf the other choices in the vignette, the NPHS1 and NPHS2 genes that code for nephrin and podocin could be\ncauses for Finnish type and non-Finnish type nephrotic syndrome, respectively; these would not be associated\nwith streak ovaries. The LAMB2 gene mutation leads to Pierson syndrome, which would be characterized by a\ncongenital onset of nephrotic syndrome and ocular features.\n\nPREP Pearls\n Congenital and infantile nephrotic syndromes often have genetic causes.\n Some of the conditions such as Denys-Drash syndrome and Pierson syndrome have associated other clinical\nfeatures that should suggest the diagnosis.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the genetic transmission of the different forms of infantile nephrotic syndrome\nSuggested Readings\n Hinkes BG, Mucha B, Vlangos CN, et al.

    "explanation": "E. increased peritubular capillary reabsorptive surface area\nGlomerulotubular balance (GTB) refers to the principle in which physiological alterations in glomerular\nfiltration rate (GFR) are associated with directionally and proportionally similar alterations in proximal tubular\nreabsorption rate. Whole kidney and single nephron studies have shown that GTB occurs during normal kidney\ndevelopment. Thus, the maturational rise in GFR is accompanied by a proportional increase in proximal tubular\nreabsorption of the glomerular filtrate. Due to this immaculate balance, extracellular fluid homeostasis is\nmaintained throughout kidney development.\nExperimental studies have identified the basic mechanisms responsible for the maturational preservation of\nGTB. The developmental rise in GFR is largely mediated by a rise in glomerular plasma flow rate, Q , and\nA\nincreased glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, K, The maturational rise in QA is due to enlargement of the\nf\narteriolar diameter and changes in the balance of vasoconstrictor/vasodilator tone, whereas the increase in Kf is\nsecondary to an increase in the glomerular filtering surface area. In turn, the corresponding maturational\nincrease in proximal tubular reabsorption rate is mainly due to enhanced tubular cell structural and functional\ncapacities combined with maturation of the postglomerular circulation. The uptake of reabsorbed glomerular\nfiltrate by the peritubular capillary, Kr, is also developmentally regulated and reflects a maturational increase in\nthe peritubular capillary surface reabsorption area.\nIn summary, maintenance of GTB during functional renal maturation requires a significant coordination in the\ngrowth of the various components of the renal microcirculation, including the preglomerular and post-\nglomerular arterioles and peritubular capillaries At the post-glomerular level, an increase in peritubular capillary\nreabsorptive surface area is the primary mechanism involved.\nWhile increased tubular length and complexity (response choice A) during maturation might contribute to\nincreased tubular absorptive capacity, the peritubular physical factors discussed previously, and especially\nenlargement of the peritubular capillary reabsorptive area must accompany this change to ensure adequate\nabsorption of the delivered glomerular filtrate. Increased filtration fraction (response choice B) is more likely to\nplay a role in cases where intraglomerular pressure is increased or plasma oncotic pressure is low. Increased\nperitubular capillary oncotic pressure (response choice C) plays a role in cases where filtration fraction is\nincreased or when plasma protein concentrations may be abnormally elevated.

    "explanation": "B. the fractional excretion of sodium indicates a prerenal state\nThis patient presents with severe edema and heavy proteinuria consistent with nephrotic syndrome. Her edema\nis fairly severe and her serum creatinine is elevated. This presentation could be consistent with a volume\ncontracted or prerenal state, or with intrinsic acute kidney injury (AKI) related to nephrotic syndrome.\nThe fractional excretion of sodium differentiates between those with a prerenal cause for renal dysfunction and\nthose with an intrinsic or postrenal cause of kidney injury. It is calculated as fractional excretion of sodium\n(FENa) = (PCr x UNa) / (PNa x UCr) x 100%. Values below 1% support a prerenal cause of renal dysfunction.\nThis patient’s fractional excretion of sodium is 0.17%. This supports that the elevated creatinine is related to\nprerenal state or volume contraction. The high blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio of 40 is also supportive of\nprerenal azotemia. The urine sodium alone may support a prerenal state if it is less than 20 mEq/L and an\nintrinsic or postrenal cause of kidney injury if greater than 40 mEq/L. In this case, the urine sodium lies in the\ngray zone.\nThe fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) = (SerumCr * UUrea) / (SerumUrea x UCr)% has been evaluated to\ndifferentiate prerenal dysfunction from intrinsic or postrenal kidney injury. One potential advantage of the\nFEUrea over FENa is that it may be used in a patient receiving diuretics. This is because the diuretics act\ndirectly on sodium excretion, whereas urea excretion is primarily dependent on peritubular forces, especially in\nthe proximal nephron segments and is not affected by most diuretics. It should be noted that the finding of a low\nFENa in the setting of diuretic use is helpful in supporting the diagnosis of a prerenal state.\nIn a study of 43 pediatric patients, 27 patients with prerenal injury state and 16 intrinsic renal injuries, only 44%\nof the prerenal patients had a FENa of less than 1%, whereas 78% of these patients had a low FEUrea defined as\nless than 35%. Unfortunately, how the patients were segregated was not well-defined (prerenal injury state\nversus intrinsic renal injury). In conditions where there is excessive urea production such as gastrointestinal\nbleeding, high protein intake, or elevated metabolic rate, the FEUrea will also be increased. This patient’s\nFEUrea was at 0.7%, which is consistent with the FENa.\nThe utility of FEUrea in critically ill adult patients has recently been challenged. In a prospective observational\nstudy of 203 patients in 3 intensive care units, a cut-off FEUrea of 35% yielded only a sensitivity of 63% and\nspecificity of 54% between transient acute kidney injury versus persistent acute kidney injury. In secondary\nanalysis of the data from a multicenter, prospective, observational study of 150 patients looking at biological\nmarkers for acute kidney injury in critically ill adults, one group found the cut-off for FEUrea yielded a\nsensitivity of 42% and a specificity of 49%.\n\nIn this patient, intravascular volume expansion with intravenous albumin could result in hypertension and\npulmonary edema if the patient had intrinsic renal injury and does not respond with diuresis to the volume load.\nBased on her low FENa and her physical examination findings (low normal blood pressure and tachycardia), we\nwould expect her to be volume contracted and potentially respond well to intravascular volume expansion. The\npotential use of FENa in the management of childhood nephrotic syndrome has been studied in a prospective\nmanner in pediatric patients with severe edema with a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate. This study of\n30 patients sought to identify those who are volume expanded who may benefit from only diuretics versus those\nthat are volume contracted. They found that patients with a FENa of less than 0.2% responded well to albumin\nfollowed by diuretics, whereas the patients with a FENa of greater than 0.2% were able to respond to diuretics\nonly. The use of a stringent FENa criteria in this study was thought to be related to the normal home sodium\nintake and normal glomerular filtration rate of these patients.\nIn general, the FENa is a convenient bedside measure that can help differentiate between prerenal azotemia and\nintrinsic AKI in children and adults. A FENa of less than 1% suggests prerenal azotemia, in which the\nreabsorption of almost all the filtered sodium by the proximal tubule represents an appropriate response to\ndecreased perfusion. A FENa greater than 2% indicates intrinsic AKI and reflects diminished sodium\nreabsorption by the damaged nephron. A FENa between 1% to 2% is considered nondiagnostic. However, the\ncut-off values are higher for infants due to the maturation delays in sodium reabsorption. Thus, in term infants,\nthe FENa is usually less than 2% in prerenal azotemia and greater than 2.5% in intrinsic AKI. In preterm\ninfants, FENa cut-off values change with gestational age, rendering this measure less helpful in this population.\nThe reliability of FENa is also limited in patients following fluids or contrast administration.\nPREP Pearls\n Fractional excretion of sodium of less than 1% is consistent with a prerenal state (with or without diuretics use).\n The precise role of fractional excretion of urea is unclear especially in adults. It may be useful in some setting\nsuch as diuretic use.\n Isolated urine sodium levels, unless low or extremely high, may not be helpful.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Be able to use and interpret urinary indices, including fractional excretion of sodium and fractional excretion of\nurea, to distinguish among various causes of oliguria\nSuggested Readings\n Darmon M, Vincent F, Dellamonica J, et al.

      "prostaglandin E2 Answer E The patient in this vignette likely initially had decreased renal perfusion from a presumed gastrointestinal illness. In states of renal hypoperfusion, a major intrarenal compensatory mechanism that prevents a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the induction of vasodilatory prostaglandins (PG) such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen are profound inhibitors of intrarenal PG production. In this vignette, the use of ibuprofen combined with the prolonged duration of renal hypoperfusion has resulted in the progression to intrinsic acute kidney injury (AKI), as evidenced by the markedly increased serum creatinine and high fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). In the early phases of renal hypoperfusion, activation of the sympathetic nervous system and systemic renin-angiotensin axis results in afferent renal vasoconstriction mediated by angiotensin II and norepinephrine, and a tendency towards diminished GFR. Fortunately, at least 3 distinct intrarenal compensatory mechanisms are brought into play in response to renal hypoperfusion, and these help maintain GFR during the initial phases (Figure). The most effective response involves the increased intrarenal generation of vasodilatory prostaglandins. Even during normal physiologic states, the cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzyme systems catalyze the intrarenal production of PGE2 and prostacyclin, both important afferent arteriolar vasodilators. Volume depletion dramatically induces this system, primarily by the upregulation of COX-2 expression in the macula densa and medullary interstitial cells. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit this response and can therefore precipitate intrinsic AKI, especially when used in the setting of renal hypoperfusion. Two common pediatric scenarios in which this occurs are: (a) following the use of indomethacin for closure of a patent ductus arteriosus in neonates, and (b) following the use of ibuprofen in febrile children with a dehydrating illness (as in this vignette). A second mechanism for maintenance of GFR during diminished renal perfusion involves the differential effect of intrarenal angiotensin II on the afferent and efferent arterioles. Intrarenal angiotensin II regulates glomerular hemodynamics in normal as well as hypoperfused states. Any decrease in renal perfusion results in a reduction in solute delivery to the distal tubule. The decrease in luminal ion (primarily chloride) concentration is sensed by the macula densa cells, which stimulates the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells. The resultant increase in local angiotensin II tends to constrict both the afferent and efferent arteriole. However, this effect is much more marked in the efferent arteriole, thus leading to increased hydrostatic pressure across the glomerulus and maintenance of GFR. An interference with this compensatory mechanism can occur following angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Myogenic autoregulation refers to the unique ability of the afferent arterioles to rapidly vasodilate in response to a decrease in lateral stretch caused by hypoperfusion. Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus that are commonly used for immunosuppression following kidney transplantation are known to interfere with myogenic autoregulatory mechanisms. The role of this response in volume-depleted states in humans has recently been challenged, and investigators have suggested a more important role for myogenic autoregulation in maintaining intraglomerular pressure during systemic hypertension. In spite of these compensatory mechanisms that help maintain GFR in volume-depleted states, both iatrogenic interference (Figure ) and prolonged reduction in renal perfusion pressure can overwhelm these pathways, leading to persistent renal vasoconstriction and precipitating intrinsic AKI, as is the case in this vignette. The other choices in the vignette are incorrect and do not account for the intrinsic AKI. Antidiuretic hormone is primarily responsible for the decreased urine output seen in prerenal AKI. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is released by cardiac myocytes in response to atrial stretch, and has the primary actions of afferent arteriolar vasodilatation and decreased sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule and collecting duct. Erythropoietin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-α-hydroxylase are not involved in the pathophysiologic response to volume depletion. Compensatory mechanisms that maintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in renal hypoperfusion are illustrated by arrows. Iatrogenic interference with these mechanisms can precipitate a reduction in GFR, as shown by dashed lines.

      "fatty acid synthase",
      "lipoprotein lipase Answer E The molecular link between nephrotic range proteinuria and hypertriglyceridemia has recently been elucidated, and is caused by the inhibition of lipoprotein lipase by angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4). Circulating Angptl4 levels increase in response to an elevated ratio of free fatty acids to albumin as a consequence of proteinuria. Elevated Angptl4 levels then lead to concentration dependent inhibition of lipoprotein lipase, resulting in hypertriglyceridemia. Thus, impaired metabolism, rather than enhanced synthesis, is primarily responsible for nephrotic hypertriglyceridemia. The delipidation cascade in which very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) are converted to intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and then to LDL by lipoprotein lipases is inhibited in the nephrotic syndrome because of the effect of Angptl4. There is also a trend toward reduced LDL receptor-mediated clearance of LDL and IDL. Abnormal lipid metabolism is common in patients with renal disease, especially among those with nephrotic syndrome in whom marked elevations in the plasma levels of cholesterol and, less predictably, triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) often occur (Table ). The hyperlipidemic response is triggered at least in part by the reduction in plasma oncotic pressure, which stimulates hepatic apolipoprotein B (apo B) gene transcription. Enhanced hepatic synthesis of lipoproteins containing apo B and cholesterol has been thought to account for most of the rise in cholesterol levels. Diminished catabolism may also play a role. Spontaneous or drug-induced resolution of the nephrotic syndrome reverses the hyperlipidemia. Patients with persistent nephrotic syndrome and hyperlipidemia are at increased risk for atherosclerotic disease, particularly if other cardiovascular risk factors are present. Hyperlipidemia may also enhance the rate of progressive glomerular injury. The lipid abnormalities induced by the nephrotic syndrome reverse with resolution of the disease. In addition to treating the underlying glomerular disease, therapeutic options include dietary modification, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers to reduce proteinuria, statins, and future novel hypolipidemic drugs. All apo B-containing lipoproteins, such as VLDL, IDL, LDL, and Lp(a), are elevated in nephrotic syndrome. A previous hypothesis was that changes in apolipoprotein C- II, which is an activator of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, and apolipoprotein C-III, an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase, with an increase of the C-III to C-II ratio, might contribute to impaired lipoprotein catabolism in nephrotic syndrome. Fatty acid synthase is a multienzyme protein that catalyzes fatty acid synthesis. It is not a single enzyme, but a whole enzymatic system in which substrates are handed from one functional domain to the next. Its main function is to catalyze the synthesis of palmitate from acetyl coenzyme A and malonyl-coenzyme A, in the presence of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Apolipoprotein A-1 is the major protein in high-density lipoprotein and plays an important role during the process of reverse cholesterol transport. It is involved in atherogenesis. Levels of apolipoprotein A-1 are usually normal in nephrotic syndrome.

      "a loop diuretic Answer B Obstructive nephropathy is a collective term describing a number of renal abnormalities caused by urinary tract obstruction. These abnormalities may include progressive reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), tubular dysfunction, water and electrolyte disturbances, and hypertension. Although increased ureteral pressure and mechanical stretch of the tubular epithelium and vasculature are believed to initiate renal injury following ureteral obstruction, it is the activation (or suppression) of downstream signaling pathways that is responsible for renal fibrosis and reduced GFR, the hallmarks of obstructive nephropathy. Experimental studies in dogs and rodents have shown that acute unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and the resulting rise in ureteral pressure is accompanied by an initial rise in renal blood flow mediated by vasodilatory prostaglandins. This is followed hours later by intense and sustained renal vasoconstriction mediated by activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The ensuing decrease in renal blood flow results in reduced GFR. Decreased glomerular perfusion, combined with tubular stretch, causes direct epithelial cell damage, leading to cell death by apoptosis. If not relieved, UUO causes nephron loss and a permanent loss of functional renal mass. As mentioned previously, aberrant activation of the RAS is one of the pathophysiological hallmarks of obstructive nephropathy. Specifically, renin gene expression (and, to a lesser extent, angiotensin-converting enzyme) is activated in chronic UUO and accounts for enhanced angiotensin II generation in the obstructed kidney. Some studies have also shown enhanced plasma renin and angiotensin II levels in UUO. Interestingly, UUO is more effective in activating the intrarenal RAS in the young compared to the mature animal. The reason is that the fetus and neonatal kidneys exhibit greater physiological activation of renin gene expression. In the adult kidney, UUO results in recruitment of new afferent arteriolar smooth muscle cells expressing renin. Activation of the intrarenal RAS has at least 3 major consequences on the kidney: 1. Angiotensin II causes preglomerular vasoconstriction leading to decreased GFR and tubular ischemia 2. Angiotensin II activates a signal transduction pathway that results in a markedly enhanced production of the pro-fibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). TGF-β, in turn, stimulates mesangial matrix deposition and interstitial collagen production via activation of connective tissue growth factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 3. Renin secretion into the bloodstream activates the circulating RAS, contributing to the development of hypertension. Although the elevated blood pressure of the patient in the vignette may be effectively lowered with the use of calcium channel blockade or adrenergic receptor blockade, these agents are not known to inhibit tissue fibrosis. A loop diuretic is generally used in the management of hypertension caused by fluid retention such as in acute glomerulonephritis. Accordingly, the use of an ACE inhibitor is the best treatment option for this patient (response choice B) because of its triple action on lowering blood pressure, prevention of renal fibrosis, and reduction of proteinuria. In addition, inhibition of ACE (the same enzyme as kininase II, which degrades kinins), increases the intrarenal levels of kinins, which are vasodilatory and antifibrotic peptides. Indeed, there is evidence that the intrarenal kallikrein-kinin system is suppressed in UUO. PREP Pearls  The pathophysiology of obstructive nephropathy involves both direct mechanical effects on the tubular epithelium and vasculature, as well as indirect effects via activation of cytokine signaling.  Activation of the renin-angiotensin system plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of obstructive nephropathy.  Although not proven in clinical trials yet, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is a logical choice for delaying progression of renal fibrosis and treatment of hypertension in patients with obstructive nephropathy.

His CRRT blood flow rate\nis 2 mL/kg per minute with a dialysate rate of 2,000 mL/1.73 m² per hour. He is being run net even for fluids. He is anuric.

    "options": [
      "250 mg every 12 hours",
      "500 mg every 12 hours",
      "750 mg every 12 hours",
      "1,000 mg every 12 hours",
      "250 mg every 24 hours Answer A The patient in this example is on a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) regimen that would nominally be expected to provide a small molecule clearance due to diffusion of approximately 33 mL/min per 1.73 m² (dialysate rate of 2,000 mL/1.73 m² per hour/60 minutes per hour) with a standard CRRT membrane. Actual clearance may be higher due to convective clearance related to fluid intake and subsequent ultrafiltration to maintain a net neutral fluid state. The clearance of small non-protein-bound drugs in this situation would be expected to parallel someone with a glomerular filtration rate between 10 and 50 mL/minute per 1.73 m². In the example presented, the theoretical drug is very similar to gabapentin and appropriate dosing would be at 250 mg every 12 hours. There are number of factors that determine whether drug dosing needs adjustment in patients with diminished renal function (Table ). Some drugs that are extensively metabolized by the liver may not need any adjustment at all. Other drugs that are extensively cleared by the kidney like the one in our vignette will require dose adjustment. Optimally, all drugs would be monitored, especially for those with low therapeutic indices, but levels are not available for many clinically important drugs. A recent study of critically ill adults on CRRT who received 5 different antibiotics showed 25% to nearly 40% variation in the volume of distribution and approximately 10% to 50% variation in the clearance between subjects on a standard CRRT regimen. It is likely the between subject variation in clearance and volume of distribution is even greater in infants and children. In addition to drug properties, it is important to understand the CRRT prescription and filter and how they relate to drug clearance. In hemodialysis, the typical dialysis rate is 1 to 3 times the blood flow rate; the blood flow rate is usually the limiting factor for small molecule clearance. The usual practice for CRRT is to have the blood flow rate in excess and the dialysis rate limiting for small molecule clearance. For example, in our 75 kg adolescent on CRRT, the blood flow rate is 150 mL/min and a dialysate rate is 2 L/hour, thus the dialysate rate is slightly more than one-fifth of the blood flow rate. If the dialysate rate doubles in the vignette, the patient may need closer to the full dose of antiepileptic drug. In addition, although the dialysate rate is prescribed, the net amount of effluent (dialysis outflow plus ultrafiltration) will be determined by the desired fluid balance of the patient and the fluid intake. In many critically ill pediatric patients on CRRT, the fluid intake relative to their size is large and the effluent may exceed the dialysate rate by 10% to 25%. This may lead to increase in clearance, especially convective clearance. Convective clearance can be prescribed in the form of pre- or postfilter replacement fluids, which can be used alone or in combination with dialysate (hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration). Since prefilter replacement fluid reduces the drug concentration going to the filter more than postfilter replacement, it increases clearance less for the same volume of replacement fluid than postfilter replacement. The properties of the membrane also influence drug clearance especially in terms of its molecular weight. The properties of the membrane include pore size, the number of pores, and the thickness of the membrane. There are limited options for the surface area of membranes and the membrane size is usually the largest that can be used so that the circuit does not exceed 10% of the patient’s blood volume. For small drugs that are cleared mostly by diffusion, the concentration gradient is of key importance and thus increasing the dialysate rate will increase the clearance. For middle or larger molecules approaching the cut-off of the filter, convective clearance and the pore size become more important. A typical cut-off for CRRT membranes is greater than 20 to 30 kDa, however, high cut-off membranes (100 kDa) are currently being investigated, mostly for clearance of inflammatory mediators in sepsis. Since the normal glomerular filtration cutoff is 30 to 50 kDa, extensive studies of drug clearance using these membranes in critically ill patients will be required.

      "thickened and distended bladder",
      "thinning of his renal parenchyma with poor cortical-medullary differentiation Answer C Posterior urethral valves (PUVs) constitute the most common lower urinary tract obstruction in boys. Antenatal sonography has allowed the early detection of PUVs. Posterior urethral valves are the most common congenital obstructive lesion of the urethra, with an estimated incidence of 1 per 3,000 to 8,000 live births, with a disproportionately elevated incidence in African-Americans and infants with Down syndrome. Anatomically, PUVs are obstructing membranous folds within the lumen of the posterior urethra with the obstruction resulting from valve leaflets or a membranous diaphragm situated at the distal limit of the verumontanum, the prominent mound of prostate tissue that forms an anatomical feature in the floor of the normal posterior urethra. The embryologic theory of PUVs development emphasized persistence of urethral valves due to lack of normal regression. On antenatal sonography, the constellation of findings most consistent with PUV include bilateral hydronephrosis, enlargement of the fetal bladder (megacystis), and oligohydramnios. The earliest sign of PUV is the presence of megacystis (distension of the fetal bladder) that could be diagnosed as early as 11 weeks. Bladder diameters greater than 17 mm in the first trimester is most likely caused by obstructive disorders. In the second trimester, megacystis has been defined as an abnormally large appearing bladder, with or without the failure of the bladder to empty over 45 min; PUVs are the most frequent cause of megacystis detected in the second or third trimester. The presence of oligohydramnios is frequently associated with bladder outlet obstruction and its observation is also a sign of poor prognosis. Potter sequence is known in the medical field as clubbed feet, pulmonary hypoplasia, and cranial anomalies related to the oligohydramnios. In a series of 40 cases of urethral obstruction, decreased amniotic fluid volume was present in 52.5% of the cases and 80% of them did not survive. Symptoms and signs in infancy include poor urinary stream, distended bladder, failure to thrive, and urinary tract infection (UTI). Neonates may occasionally present with abdominal distension, abdominal mass, poor urinary output, and chronic kidney disease at birth. Severe respiratory distress may be a serious management problem due to pulmonary hypoplasia. The latter may be the most important prognostic factor for survival. Pulmonary hypoplasia is due to a decreased amniotic fluid resulting in oligohydramnios and, depending on severity, may not be compatible with survival. Children with PUV may also present with septicemia, acidosis, and at various stages of chronic kidney disease. Although most patients are diagnosed in the prenatal and neonatal period, there have been published reports of patients presenting in adolescence and the second decade of life. Among the most common symptoms in late presenting PUV are voiding symptoms, incontinence, hematuria, and UTI. Postnatally, the diagnosis of PUV is confirmed by a combination of renal imaging, including a neonatal ultrasound examination and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). Findings depend on the severity of PUV. Renal-bladder ultrasonography is an important tool to evaluate for the degree of hydroureteronephrosis, renal parenchyma, renal size, and bladder wall thickening. Increased renal echogenicity and subcortical cysts are poor prognostic signs for renal function. A thick walled bladder may signify a poorly compliant bladder that can result in damage to the renal parenchyma and upper urinary tract at filling pressures above 40 cm H2O. A VCUG shows PUV with thick-walled trabeculated bladder, bladder diverticulum, and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Posterior urethral valves are often accompanied by severe consequences to the lower and upper urinary tract and is one of the most common causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during childhood. In spite of the advances in the diagnosis and management of patients with PUVs, approximately one-quarter of the patients progress to ESRD during long-term follow-up. In addition, patients with PUVs can also exhibit comorbidities such as recurrent UTI, dysfunctional voiding, urinary incontinence, and CKD. Depending on the severity of renal damage, the affected patients may also suffer from salt-losing nephropathy and polyuria, which increase the risk of failure to thrive and episodes of dehydration. The latter can cause a precipitous drop in already compromised renal function. The morbidity of PUVs is related to the congenital obstruction of the urinary tract at a critical time in organogenesis, which may have a lifelong impact on kidney, ureter, and bladder function. Therefore, the morbidity associated with PUVs extends beyond childhood into adult life. Consequently, all children born with PUV require long-term careful monitoring. A multidisciplinary team approach is required to diagnose and manage this complex disorder. In this vignette, response choices A, B, D, and E are all important prognostic signs for the long-term outcome to his urinary tract and likelihood of progression to ESRD. Response choice C refers to the impact of oligohydramnios on his prenatal lung development and has the most important immediate prognostic significance to his survival in the neonatal period. Severe pulmonary hypoplasia may not be compatible with life.

      "Pearson’s correlation Answer A The pediatric nephrologist wants to know whether mean serum phosphorus level differ by race/ethnicity, which includes more than 2 mutually exclusive categories. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) is the best option for comparing mean values of more than 2 groups, assuming that the data are normally distributed. The choice of the most appropriate statistical test to use to depends on characteristics of the variables (Table). In general, variables can be categorical (eg, male, female) or continuous (eg, age, serum phosphorus). Categorical variables can be dichotomous (eg, vaccinated or unvaccinated) or fall into more than 2 categories (eg, race/ethnicity). In this case, we are considering a quantitative continuous variable, serum phosphorus. There are 3 main types of statistical analysis: 1) descriptive (eg, mean age in 1 population) 2) comparative (eg, t-test, ANOVA, Chi square) 3) measure associations between variables (eg, linear regression, Pearson correlation) It is important to remember that statistical associations do not prove causality. T-tests and ANOVA are used when the mean of a continuous variable is being compared between groups (as in the vignette, Figure). A t test is used to compare two groups (eg, the mean age of 2 different groups). A paired t-test is used when the measured outcome is assessed twice in the same group (eg, pre- and post- treatment). An independent t-test is used when two groups are being compared on a single measured outcome (eg, adult height in children with and without a history of childhood chronic kidney disease). A Chi square (c2) statistic is used to investigate whether the distribution of categorical variables differs between groups (eg, examining risk of influenza infection [yes/no] in children who were vaccinated versus unvaccinated). Statistical tests for testing associations depend on characteristics of the variables, including the number of groups in each variable to be compared, whether subjects in the variable groups are matched, and how the outcome variable being compared between the 2 groups is measured. A Pearson’s correlation is a measurement of the linear association between 2 continuous variables and cannot be used for categorical variables such as race/ethnicity. A regression analysis can be performed using both categorical and quantitative variables and allows for testing for association of multiple variables with an outcome (eg, age, sex, and race/ethnicity with mean serum phosphorus level). The null hypothesis of the ANOVA is that 2 or more groups have the same mean. ANOVA uses the F-statistic, which represents the amount of variability between samples versus the overall variability of all samples: F = between the group variability/within group variability Between the group variability is calculated by taking the sum of the square difference in the mean of each group minus the overall mean of all the data, times the number of observations, divided by number of groups minus 1: (where Yi is sample mean in the ith group, ni is the number of observations in the ith group, and Y is overall mean of the data, K the number of groups). Within group variability is calculated by taking the sum of the square difference of measured values in the group, divided by the sample size minus the number of groups: (Yij is the jth observation in the ith out of K groups and N is the overall sample size). Just as with the t-test, there is a chart of values for the F-test with critical F statistics that indicate when the null hypothesis is rejected. This varies depending upon the “degrees of freedom,” which is calculated as: Total df = n - 1 (where n is the total number of observations). Between groups df = number of groups - 1 Within groups df = total df - between groups df for a one-way ANOVA. In general, statistical software is used to perform ANOVA analyses. A two-way ANOVA is also possible, and allows one to test whether the means that differ between groups are different when the groups are divided by 2 different characteristics (eg, male/female and race/ethnicity).

      "myocardial stunning Answer B Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in children receiving maintenance dialysis. Moreover, young adults developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during childhood have a significantly diminished life expectancy. Evidence of CVD can be observed, even in predialysis CKD. Most of these abnormalities have been detected using echocardiography. The most common parameters studied are left ventricular (LV) function and LV geometry (Table ). LV geometry: This is assessed by two-dimensional directed M-mode echocardiography. LV hypertrophy (LVH): Two dimensional M mode echo measurements of LV end-diastolic cavity (LVED) and septal (IVS) and posterior wall (PW) thicknesses are used to derive both left ventricular mass (LVM) and relative wall thickness (RWT) of the left ventricle. Since there are physiologic allometric changes of LVM during childhood, the most common method to account for this is by indexing LVM to height of 2.7. This approach has been adopted recently in several pediatric populations, and recent findings in adults have demonstrated that this method of normalization is superior to other standardization techniques in predicting cardiovascular disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy was defined as LVM index (LVMI) greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for normal children and adolescents.  Concentric LVH: Increased LVMI (≥ 95th percentile) and elevated RWT (≥ 0.41)  Eccentric LVH: Increased LVMI and normal RWT (< 0.41).  Concentric remodeling: Presence of an elevated RWT, but with a normal LVMI. Ventricular function: Global systolic function: This is usually expressed as left ventricular ejection fraction, which is expressed as the ratio of stroke volume divided by the end-diastolic volume. Another way to measure global systolic function is shortening fraction, which is the ratio of change of LV diameter between diastole and systole divided by end- diastolic diameter. Diastolic function: Since diastolic phase is when ventricular filling takes place, 2D echocardiogram can be used to be to quantify early (E) and late(A) filling. Since most of the filling occurs in early phase in healthy individuals, a decreased E/A ratio would indicate stiff ventricles and diastolic dysfunction even with preserved systolic function. Special techniques: Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) enables measurement of high amplitude, low frequency Doppler shifts caused by myocardial motion. Systole: An extension of TDI velocity measurement is the calculation of strain and strain rate. Strain, which is a change in length corrected for the original length or the fractional or percentage change from the original or unstressed dimension, reflects deformation of a structure and therefore directly describes the contraction/relaxation pattern of the myocardium; strain rate is the rate of this deformation and is a strong index of LV contractility. Diastole: During systole, the mitral valve annulus descends towards the apex, whereas it recoils back toward the base in early (e') and late (a') diastole. Accordingly, E/e' ratio can be applied for the estimation of LV filling pressures and has been used to quantify diastolic dysfunction. Myocardial dysfunction in CKD has been reported by 2 large pediatric studies: the CKiD study and ESCAPE study. The most prevalent abnormality is LVH. CKiD reported a prevalence of 17%. LVH was more frequent in children with sustained (both casual and ambulatory) (34%) and masked (20%) systolic or diastolic hypertension as compared to children with normal casual and ambulatory BP (8%). Data from the ESCAPE trial showed that an abnormal LV geometry was found in 43.3% of the patients, with 22.3% of all patients showing concentric LV geometry (concentric LV remodeling was observed in 10.2%, concentric LVH in 12.1%) and 21% exhibiting eccentric LVH. Low hemoglobin, low glomerular filtration rate, young age, and high body mass index were independent correlates of LV mass index. LVH was not correlated with casual or ABPM obtained blood pressures. However, all ESCAPE study enrollees were treated with ramipril, which could have blunted the effects of BP on LVMI. Concentric, as well as eccentric, LVH persists (40%–85%) during long-term dialysis. Data from the International Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Network registry on 507 patients reported an overall prevalence of LVH to be 48%. Patients in the ESCAPE study also had systolic function assessed by measurement of shortening fraction at the endocardial (eS) and midwall (mS) levels and computation of end-systolic stress (myocardial afterload) at these levels. Patients exhibited a 6% lower eS and 10% lower mS than control subjects. The prevalence of subclinical systolic dysfunction as defined by impaired mS was more than 5-fold higher in patients when compared to controls. Systolic dysfunction was most common (48%) in patients with concentric hypertrophy and associated with lower hemoglobin levels. This study shows that, despite normal LV chamber function, myocardial dysfunction can be identified at the mS level in children and adolescents with mild-to-moderate CKD. In pediatrics global systolic dysfunction may be a late sign, as evidenced by normal or even supranormal LV function in most children receiving maintenance dialysis. However, such function can decrease during activity, as demonstrated with mild systolic dysfunction, which has been observed in dialyzed children during exercise testing. Myocardial stunning, which is defined as a reduction in regional wall motion in 2 or more segments from baseline and hyperkinesis in global parameters of cardiac contractility, are reported to occur in pediatric patients receiving maintenance dialysis, but this phenomenon has not been shown in CKD patients. Similarly, cardiac calcifications have been reported to occur in 15% to 40% in children receiving maintenance dialysis, but has not been reported in pediatric CKD patients. Coronary aneurysms are not reported to be common in the pediatric CKD population. PREP Pearls  The most prevalent echocardiographic abnormality is left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).  Despite normal LV chamber function, myocardial dysfunction can be identified by subtle measures in children and adolescents with mild-to-moderate CKD.

Bacteremia, especially related to the use of vascular catheters, is a major reason for catheter loss and can be life-threatening. The best way to prevent infection in HD is the use of appropriate vascular access. Arteriovenous (AV) fistulae have the lowest reported rates of infection, as low as 0.2 infections per 1,000 HD procedures, while AV grafts have a risk 2.5 times greater than that of fistula. The use of a central venous catheter (CVC) for HD has markedly greater risk, with cuffed catheters having 15.5 times and uncuffed catheters 22.5 times greater relative risk than fistula, respectively. The increased risk of infection with CVC is due to loss of skin integrity and the risk of biofilm formation. Biofilm formation often takes place immediately after placement of the catheter, and permits bacterial colonization, particularly by Staphylococcus aureus, almost immediately thereafter. The bacterial colonization of a CVC can contribute to both the development of antimicrobial resistance, as well as risk of recurrent infections. The use of systemic antibiotics alone does not penetrate into the biofilm and therefore does not allow for the eradication of bacteria, such that less than 25% of all infected CVC may be preserved. Therefore, the approach in treating CVC-related infections should often focus on “salvage of the site” (and patient) rather than “salvage of the catheter.” Preventable risk factors for HD catheter-related bacteremia in adult studies have included longer catheter use, more frequent catheter infusions, local (exit site) infections, and nasal carriage of S aureus. Therefore, preventive measures for infection have focused on reducing contamination of the catheter lumens and exit site. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has given recommendations to help prevent infections in the use of all catheters that are generally applicable to dialysis catheters, while also offering a few specific recommendations for dialysis catheters. General recommendations regarding CVC use include appropriate hand hygiene, aseptic technique, dressing changes, use of needleless systems, and scrubbing of lumens before access. Specific recommendations for dialysis CVCs include the use of topical antibiotics with dressing changes at the exit site and the use of antibiotic lock solutions. The recommendations for preventing infections with AV fistula or graft include proper skin cleansing of the access site before cannulation, along with aseptic technique. Various studies have shown that CVC infection rates may be reduced with the use of detailed catheter care protocols (such as “hub care” and regular regimens of exit site dressing changes) and the use of anti-infective locking agents (such as citrate and taurolidine), while variations in types of catheter technology (like silver impregnation) have negligible effects on infection reduction. With the proliferation of use of CVC outside of the dialysis setting, general recommendations have been developed (by the Infectious Diseases Society of America) to appropriately diagnose bacteremia in patients with CVC that are also applicable to patients dialyzed via a CVC. Peripheral blood samples remain the gold standard for diagnosis in HD patients, though they may not always be obtained because of avoiding injury to vessels, which may later be needed for permanent access or out of simple convenience. When a peripheral blood sample is not easily obtained, then a culture from bloodlines connected to the CVC may be obtained, though this culture may be positive from bacterial colonization within the catheter without true risk of metastasizing infection to the patient. Therefore, it is generally not recommended to routinely obtain screening cultures from asymptomatic patients with CVC, and avoid overtreating colonization, but it is recommended to obtain cultures in individuals with any suspicious symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise, and hypotension. A very recent study in adult HD patients has challenged the validity of peripheral blood cultures as the gold standard in this population, as a greater sensitivity and specificity was found in cultures drawn from the dialysis circuit than peripherally or from catheter lumens. In patients with a suspected catheter-related blood stream infection (BSI) who have initiated antibiotic therapy, the antibiotics may be discontinued if blood cultures are negative, no other source of infection has been identified, and the patient remains asymptomatic. However, positive blood culture results, even if only from the catheter, should lead to continuation of antibiotics for possible BSI even in the patient who is later asymptomatic. The one exception would be in the scenario that peripheral blood cultures remain negative while only a CVC culture is positive in a patient without continued symptoms, where it may be thought that the patient did not have a BSI. Therefore, in the vignette described above with a lack of peripheral blood cultures obtained, it would be inappropriate to discontinue antibiotics in the setting of a positive blood culture following a treatment session during which the patient was symptomatic. In most cases of catheter-related bacteremia, it is recommended that the catheter be removed as the risk of treatment failure with intravenous (IV) antibiotics alone (without catheter removal) is 5 times greater. There are conditions in which expeditious removal of the dialysis catheter is recommended in the setting of bacteremia. This includes when symptoms persist after 48 to 72 hours despite treatment, there is infection of the catheter tunnel, recurrence of infection, and infections by S aureus, Pseudomonas, or Candida. As most patients are unable to go any extended period without dialysis, under these conditions, it is generally recommended that the infected catheter be removed and a temporary catheter be placed in another anatomical site to minimize any disruption of therapy and yet possibly salvage the access site for permanent access. When this occurs, a long-term dialysis CVC may be placed once blood cultures with negative results (generally after 5 days) are obtained. However, with less virulent bacterial pathogens and rapid resolution of symptoms, this aggressive management strategy is not necessary, as treatment with appropriate IV antibiotics and exchange over a guidewire may be considered. In the vignette, the patient had rather rapid resolution of symptoms and a positive blood culture for a bacterial pathogen that does not mandate aggressive treatment, such that immediate catheter removal and temporary catheter placement, as in response choice B, may not be as appropriate, especially given the limited options for temporary access in a patient scheduled for kidney transplant in the near future. In patients dialyzed via CVC that are no longer symptomatic from bacteremia, it is presumed that the source of infection may be from intraluminal or catheter tip colonization of bacteria. In these cases, exchange of the dialysis catheter over a guidewire may effectively remove the source of infection while also being associated with less morbidity and cost. When considering CVC exchange over a guidewire in an asymptomatic patient, it is not considered necessary to wait for negative blood cultures before performing an exchange and this should not be a cause of delay. However, even with removal of the presumably “infected” catheter by either temporary catheter placement in another site or exchange over guidewire at the original site, it is still recommended to treat any catheter-related bacteremia appropriately with 14 days of IV antibiotics. With coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, this treatment course may be shortened to 5 to 7 days in uncomplicated cases in which the catheter is removed; however, treatment with systemic antibiotics (oral may also be considered in stable patients), possibly in conjunction with antibiotic lock solution, is generally recommended. Similarly, antibiotic lock solution should not be used alone to treat bacteremia as it only treats intraluminally and not systemically. Therefore, treatment with only antibiotic lock solution and not systemic antibiotics, especially after the catheter has been removed is not appropriate. Alternatively, in patients for whom catheter removal is not necessarily indicated (rapid absence of symptoms and infection), the dialysis catheter may be retained and the use of antibiotic lock solution along with IV antibiotics can be considered with fairly good rates of infection resolution. It is generally recommended that the concomitant use of both forms of antibiotics last for 7 to 14 days, though longer periods may be indicated with different bacterial pathogens. Using this strategy, successful treatment of Staphylococcus epidermidis infections have ranged from 75% to 84% of cases. However, with opting to retain the catheter, it is recommended to check a blood culture 1 week after completion of IV antibiotics to confirm resolution. If cultures remain positive at this time, then it would generally be recommended to remove the catheter. Thus, in the vignette, it may be most appropriate in this stable patient with potential limited vascular access options to consider retention of the catheter with concomitant use of appropriate IV and intraluminal antibiotic solutions. Other lock solutions, such as citrate and ethanol, have been considered as anti-infective therapy in some conditions with efficacy, so they may be considered in especially difficult situations (recurrent infections in patients without any other vascular access options). However, they have not been studied as systematically as other standard antibiotic lock solutions. For vancomycin use as an antibiotic lock, its concentrations should generally be 1,000-fold higher than the reported minimal inhibitory concentration. PREP Pearls  If a dialysis catheter becomes infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, or Candida, it is generally recommended that the catheter be removed promptly.  As catheters will often develop biofilm colonized with bacteria that is difficult to clear with intravenous antibiotics, the approach in treating central venous catheter-related infections should often focus on “salvage of the site” rather than “salvage of the catheter.”  For patients for whom catheter removal is not indicated (resolved symptoms, less virulent bacteria), the use of intravenous antibiotics and antibiotic lock for 10 to 14 days may be considered as an alternative approach, but requires follow-up culture 1 week after completion of therapy to confirm resolution of infection.

Review of her medical records reveals that her serum creatinine has been 0.6\nto 0.7 mg/dL (53-61.9 µmol/L) and her clinic blood pressures (BP) have been between 120 to 130/65 to 75 mm\nHg.

    "explanation": "B. determination of the left ventricular mass\nWhen evaluating a child with confirmed hypertension, it is essential to assess for comorbidities and signs of\nend-organ damage. These findings guide treatment decisions and dictate follow-up. In this vignette, you are\ncaring for a child with known secondary hypertension who has clinic blood pressures (BP) above treatment\ntargets. Due to her chronic kidney disease, the goal for her blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Review\nof her prior record reveals that the majority of her clinic BPs are above this goal, and in fact some, including the\naverage BP obtained in your clinic, are in the hypertensive range. Obtaining an echocardiogram to investigate\nfor left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and assess overall level of BP control is a logical next step.\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy is a form of end organ damage seen with chronic hypertension. Left ventricular\nhypertrophy occurs in response to increased left ventricular afterload. It is a compensatory mechanism to\ndecrease and ultimately normalize the stress on the left ventricular wall that occurs with hypertension. For this\nreason, current pediatric hypertension guidelines recommend obtaining an echocardiogram at initial diagnosis\nof hypertension and intermittently thereafter to help determine degree of BP control over time. While many\nchildren can be managed conservatively at initial diagnosis with therapeutic lifestyle change, the presence of\nechocardiographically confirmed LVH is an indication to start an antihypertensive medication. Successful\nhypertension treatment leads to the regression of LVH, which is an ultimate goal of therapy.\nPatients with hypertension generally develop concentric LVH, in which left ventricular mass is increased in\nassociation with increased left ventricular wall thickness. This is different from the volume overload-induced\neccentric LVH, in which left ventricular mass is increased with normal relative left ventricular wall thickness.\nChildren with concentric remodeling are also at increased cardiovascular disease risk.\nOver time, children with LVH can experience decreased compliance and filling of the left ventricle (diastolic\ndysfunction) that can ultimately lead to heart failure. While diastolic dysfunction often occurs with LVH, it can\noccur independent of LVH and is also associated with hypertension.\nThe vasculature can also be directly affected by hypertension. Elevated BP can lead to endothelial damage and\ndysfunction. In the presence of a damaged endothelium, there can be a paradoxical effect where vasodilatory\nmolecules cause vasoconstriction instead of dilation because they have direct access to the underlying smooth\nmuscle cells. Endothelial damage, thought to be an early stage of atherosclerosis, can be assessed via flow-\nmediated brachial dilatation, which is a noninvasive ultrasonographic study that measures endothelial-\ndependent vasodilatation.\nDiminished flow-mediated dilatation is associated with increased carotid intima media thickness, a preclinical\nmarker of atherosclerosis. We know from the Bogalusa Heart study that atherosclerosis is present in children as\n\nyoung as 2 years of age, and the fibrous plaques are associated with traditional cardiovascular disease risk\nfactors such as body mass index, blood pressure, and lipids. While not part of the hypertension guidelines, one\ncan assess for the presence of atherosclerosis by measuring the thickness of the intima and media of the carotid\nartery by ultrasonographic examination. Another noninvasive method is the measurement of pulse wave\nvelocity. This is done by radial artery tonometry; increased pulse wave velocity is felt to reflect increased\narterial stiffness, which is another early sign of atherosclerosis.\nAs described previously, the vasculature is particularly vulnerable to insults and damage from hypertension.\nDamage to microvasculature in the kidney can cause microalbuminuria. Over time, this can lead to progressive\nkidney injury. In fact, hypertension is the second most common cause of end-stage renal disease in adults. The\ncerebral vasculature can also be affected by elevated blood pressure. This can have a myriad of clinical effects\nin children, some of which are subtle and some of which are not. In pediatrics, the neurologic consequences of\nhypertension most commonly recognized include hypertensive encephalopathy and seizures, although ischemic\nand hemorrhagic strokes can also occur, with rates estimated as 1.2 to 13 cases per 100,000 children younger\nthan 18 years of age. Silent brain infarcts can occur that do not result in stroke-like symptoms, but instead lead\nto subtle defects in physical and/or cognitive function. This has been more studied in adults, where defects in\nlearning, attention, and memory have been shown to occur. Over time, symptoms can progress to encompass\nsleep disturbances, fatigue, and difficulty with concentration. Children can also have neurocognitive defects as a\nconsequence of hypertension. Pediatric hypertension has been associated with learning disabilities, behavior and\nmood disturbances such as anxiety, depression, inattention, and poor executive functioning. Other associated\nsymptoms in children include restlessness, temper tantrums, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. In both adults and\nchildren, these symptoms tend to improve with antihypertensive treatment.\nDespite all the known forms of hypertensive end-organ damage, the current guidelines only recommend routine\nscreening for LVH. It is again for this reason that response choice B is the preferred response. While systolic\ndysfunction can occur in hypertensive disease states and with renal failure, it is not common in children with\nmild chronic kidney disease and stage I hypertension. Cardiac fibrosis can occur with hypertension and it\ncontributes to the development of LVH. Fibrosis can also cause arrhythmias by interfering with cardiac\nconduction and causing re-entry circuits to form. However, cardiac fibrosis is uncommon in otherwise healthy\nchildren and can be diagnosed noninvasively by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and not echocardiography.\nFinally, while congenital anomalies of the kidney and urology tract (CAKUT) are associated with other\nabnormalities, cardiac anomalies are not commonly associated with CAKUT and it would be unusual to have\nsuch an anomaly undiagnosed at 16 years of age.\nPREP Pearls\n Hypertension can cause cardiovascular, renal, and neurological end-organ damage that may be asymptomatic.\n\n All hypertensive children should have an echocardiogram done at initial diagnosis and then periodically\nthereafter to assess for the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the end-organ effects of hypertension on the cardiac, vascular, renal, and neurologic systems\nSuggested Readings\n American Academy of Pediatrics.

    "explanation": "B. Fisher exact test\nStatistics is the study of variation in the data. Such variability is particularly notable in the biological sciences\nand especially in studies that involve humans, where less control is possible over factors that increase variation.\nThe correct analysis of data is one of the most critical aspects of scientific research. An incorrect test can lead to\nan erroneous result and interpretation. While it is not possible to cover all statistical tests in this critique, the\nfollowing paragraphs provide a brief outline of the most common statistical tests and the situations in which\nthey should be used.\nTo decide which test to use, it is useful to first classify studies as either cross-sectional (data are acquired on a\nsubject at only one point in time) or longitudinal (data are acquired on a subject at multiple time points). Within\na cross-sectional study, it is then useful to know if the study involves only two groups or more than 2 groups.\nFinally, the investigator should determine if the data are continuous (data can take any value within the\nspectrum) or discrete (further subdivided as categorical [descriptive) or ordinal [discrete numbers with\ndirectionality]).\nUnivariate tests look at the association of one variable to another outcome variable, whereas multivariable\nmodels incorporate the effects of multiple variables upon the outcome variable. For continuous data, the data\ndistribution is also very important to ascertain. Data that form a specific pattern around a middle point value (in\neither a football-shaped cloud or a bell-shaped curve, depending on how the graph is created) follow the\ncharacteristics of a Gaussian distribution, sometimes also referred to as a “normal” distribution. Many\ncontinuous data sets in fact do follow a Gaussian distribution, such as the height of all males in a country at age\n10 years. However, many datasets do not, such as the income of a country’s population, which is skewed to the\nleft (many more people at lower income) and has a long tail to the right (fewer people with very high incomes).\nWhen in doubt, the use of nonparametric tests, which do not assume any distribution, is recommended. Note\nhere that your “sample” (your smaller dataset) may not show the same distribution as the “population” (the\nuniverse of all subjects with the same characteristics). The investigator should also ascertain upfront whether\nthe data meet key criteria of independence between data points. Such independence is not present in paired\nsamples from the same subject, so paired samples are handled differently in statistical comparisons.\nOnce the investigator has determined the characteristics of the study design and the data distribution, the\ninvestigator can then decide which test is most appropriate to determine the significance of any differences in\nresults. The reader should note that the scientific community has arbitrarily defined significance as less than a 1\nin 20 chance (hence the probability or p < 0.05). It is still possible for a finding to be different by chance even at\nless than 1 in 20, especially with very large sample sizes, but still not be clinically meaningful. Conversely, a p-\n\nvalue of 0.06, while not meeting the prespecified significance criteria, might be enough for a result to have\nclinical value.\nIn the vignette, the data set is cross-sectional. The data are a series of discrete numbers that are not truly\ncontinuous, but can be best represented as proportions of sensitive/totals for each antibiotic. Only 2 study\ngroups are present. The data are not from paired subjects. Therefore, when looking at the Table , one can\ndiscern that either chi-square test or Fisher exact test would be appropriate to determine the difference in\nantibiotic sensitivity proportion for the single agent cefazolin between group A and group B.\nTable.

When in doubt, the Fisher exact test is\nrecommended.\nOf the other vignette options, a Student’s t test is used when comparing the means of 2 groups of continuous\ndata that are typically less than 30 sample size in each group, where the population is expected to have a\nGaussian distribution. A Z test would be used if both samples are sufficiently large and a Gaussian distribution\nis seen in the samples themselves, typically more than 30 in each group. A Pearson correlation test determines\nthe relative correlation between 2 sets of continuous data that have a Gaussian distribution, not whether the 2\nmeans are significantly different. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve displays the frequency of occurrence of the\nevent of interest in 2 or more groups over time. It does not test if the 2 curves are significantly different from\neach other, which is the function of other tests such as a log-rank test.\nPREP Pearls\n Statistics is the study of variation in data and is a key part of all scientific studies.\n\n Investigators have to first determine the type and distribution of their data before choosing a statistical test of\ndifference between study groups.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the appropriate use of the chi-square test versus a t-test\nSuggested Readings\n Eck D, Ryan J.

    "explanation": "C. patients with truncating mutations tend to have more severe phenotype\nAutosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 infants and is\ntypically caused by defects in the gene PKHD1. PKHD1 encodes the protein fibrocystin, also known as\npolyductin. Fibrocystin is expressed in the primary cilia of renal epithelial cells and in bile docs. Approximately\n40% of the patients with ARPKD are detected by prenatal ultrasonography with echogenic kidneys and\noligohydramnios. Many of these severely affected infants die of pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory failure in\nthe neonatal period. At the other extreme, patients may have cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts due\nto defective ductal plate formation and develop congenital hepatic fibrosis (Caroli syndrome). These patients\nmay go on to have progressive hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension, with some having only a mild renal\nphenotype even into young adulthood.\nThe PKDH1 gene is a very large gene of over 500 kb on chromosome 6p12. Over 700 different PKHD1\nmutations have been described. In most series of severely affected ARPKD patients, the mutation detection rate\nis about 80%. Mutations may be graded by severity. Truncating mutations, which include nonsense, frameshift,\nand splicing mutations, tend to have the most severe phenotype. Nontruncating mutations are thought to be less\nsevere. These include missense and in frame modifications. In a study of 62 pregnancies with ARPKD fetuses,\npatients with 2 severe mutations showed greater extension of collecting duct dilatation when compared to those\nwith less severe mutations. Patients with 2 truncating mutations also displayed greater perinatal demise.\nWithin a family, there can be discordant phenotypes. There is evidence that aberrant transcriptional regulation\nmay explain some of the variability. In addition, modifier genes such as HNF1B are known to interact with\nPKHD1 in animal models. In one family, a 7-year-old child showed portal hypertension and renal insufficiency\ndue to ARPKD, whereas a relative had normal renal function with only multiple nodular cystic lesions in the\nliver despite having the same PKHD1 genotype. In another family, a 29-year-old individual had renal cysts and\nCaroli disease, whereas a relative had no hepatic or renal findings despite an identical PKHD1 genotype. Thus,\ngenetic testing will not reveal whether a kidney-predominant or liver-predominant disease will develop.\nInternational expert consensus recommendations have been developed for ARPKD. Important points relevant\nto this patient is that 2% of all patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease expressed a neonatal\nsevere phenotype similar to this patient. In addition, mutations of HNF1β may also mimic this phenotype. For\nthis reason, they do not recommend genetic testing as a first-line diagnostic approach for infants with an\nARPKD-like phenotype. In children that are genotyped, the ability to predict clinical course from the genotype\nis limited and caution must be used.\n\nPREP Pearls\n Patients with 2 PKHD1 truncating mutations have a severe phenotype.\n Interpretation of nonsevere mutations is problematic.\n There can be phenotypic variability within a family.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the molecular and genetic basis for autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease\nSuggested Readings\n Denamur E, Delezoide AL, Alberti C, et al.

The incidence is 1:40,000 of\nthe population and is found in 2% of profoundly deaf children. Renal abnormalities include bilateral renal\nagenesis, bilateral hypoplasia or dysplasia (response choice B is correct), unilateral renal agenesis with\ncontralateral hypoplasia or dysplasia, ureteropelvic obstruction, and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The kidneys\nmay be normal. Renal function ranges from normal to severe reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\nExtrarenal manifestations include preauricular pits, malformations in external, middle, and inner ear, and\nhearing loss. There may be cervical fistulas or cysts. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with high penetrance\nand variable expression; mutations in 3 genes, EYA1, SIX1, and SIX5, are causally associated with BOR\nsyndrome, the majority of whom have a mutation in the EYA1 gene. Prognosis depends on the severity of the\nrenal disorder.\nResponse choice B is incorrect as the low lying kidneys look normal.

Unless associated with dysplasia, VUR, or\nobstruction, there are few long-term effects of ectopic kidneys. Horseshoe kidney occurs with increased\nfrequency in Turner syndrome and other syndromes. In children with ectopia, a voiding cystourethrogram may\nbe needed to exclude VUR, and a radionuclide scan may be needed if there is ultrasonographic evidence of\nobstruction.\nResponse choice D is incorrect as there is no specific association of unilateral multicystic kidney with BOR\nsyndrome. A multicystic kidney is the result of abnormal metanephric differentiation. This is the second most\ncommon cause of flank mass in the newborn. The prevalence rate is about 1 in 4,000.

The diagnosis is made in utero by prenatal\nultrasonography or by detection of an abdominal mass, or by evaluation of a urinary tract infection. Multicystic\nkidney is rarely the cause of symptoms in the newborn. The multicystic kidney does not function. The\ncontralateral kidney can be normal, but in up to 50% of the cases, the other kidney may be hydronephrotic,\nectopic, have VUR, and occasionally, it may be dysplastic. Patients may be followed by yearly ultrasonography.\nSpontaneous involution often occurs without complications of infection, bleeding, or malignancy.\nResponse choice A is incorrect as bilateral large echogenic kidneys in the newborn are not associated with BOR\nsyndrome and suggest a specific differential diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes autosomal recessive\npolycystic kidney disease, metabolic conditions such as tyrosinemia type 1, and proximal tubular dysgenesis. In\naddition, in glomerulocystic kidney disease, the kidneys may be small, normal, or large in size.\n\nIsolated renal hypoplasia consists of a smaller quantity of structurally normal nephrons. Although the causes of\nrenal hypoplasia remain unknown, genetic determinants play a role. The number of nephrons that are created\nappears to be limited by the number of nephron progenitors generated during kidney development. Findings\nsuggest that mechanisms that regulate apoptosis of the metanephric mesenchyme (from which nephron\nprogenitors are derived), and of the progenitors themselves, have a significant impact on congenital nephron\nendowment. Thus, ablation of a subset of nephron progenitors results in decreased ureteric bud branching and\ndecreased adult nephron endowment. Studies have been done to characterize the growth factors that promote\nsurvival of the metanephric mesenchyme or nephron progenitors. In vitro candidates include transforming\ngrowth factor-β2 (TGF-β2), TGFα, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast\ngrowth factor 2 (FGF2), fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20), and bone\nmorphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7). In vivo transgenic mouse studies demonstrate that FGF9 and FGF20 are\nessential for preserving nephron progenitor survival. Indeed, FGF20 mutations in human beings are associated\nwith severe renal dysplasia. The extent to which some or all of these factors act endogenously to promote\nnephron progenitor survival continues to be determined.\nThe clinical diagnosis of renal hypoplasia is suggested when there is reduction of renal size by 2 standard\ndeviations for the mean size by age, exclusion of renal scarring by 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)\nradionuclide scan, and in cases of unilateral renal hypoplasia, compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral\nkidney. The kidneys should look normal, but small by renal ultrasonography. An unequivocal diagnosis is based\nupon histologic examination, which is not necessary for diagnosis. Pure hypoplasia is uncommon and most\ncases are associated with renal dysplasia (renal hypodysplasia). Renal dysplasia is characterized by the presence\nof non-kidney and malformed kidney tissue elements. The kidney(s) look echodense by renal ultrasonography.\nCharacteristic microscopic abnormalities include geographic disorganization of nephron elements, abnormal\ndifferentiation of mesenchymal and epithelial elements, decreased number of nephrons, and metaplastic\ntransformation of metanephric mesenchyme to cartilage and bone. Dysplastic kidneys are variable in size, but\nmost are smaller than normal. Size is often determined by the presence or absence of cysts and may be\nunilateral or bilateral. Dysplasia occurs in 3 out of 1,000 births, with a male-to-female ratio for bilateral renal\ndysplasia of 1.3:1 and for unilateral dysplasia of 1.9:1.\nThe overall renal function in patients with unilateral renal hypoplasia or dysplasia with normal contralateral\nkidney is normal. Depending on the severity of renal pathology, patients with bilateral renal involvement may\npresent with renal failure at birth or progress slowly to end-stage renal failure later in life. Patients can also\npresent with failure-to-thrive, polyuria with polydipsia, and frequent episodes of dehydration.\nPREP Pearls\n Renal dysplasia in its various forms in the most common cause of chronic kidney disease in children.\n\n Renal dysplasia and hypoplasia fall into the spectrum of congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urogenital\ntract.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Recognize the presentation and histopathology of renal hypoplasia and dysplasia\nSuggested Readings\n Cebrian C, Asai N, D’Agati V, Costantini F.

Renal artery thrombosis is associated with\nmicroscopic hematuria, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury if there is bilateral involvement. It is often\nassociated with an aortic thrombus which can cause decreased lower extremity pulses. Doppler renal\nultrasonography will show poor perfusion to the affected kidney. However, an early thrombus may not be\nvisualized. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiogram may reveal thrombi and blood flow\nabnormalities to the affected kidney. Prognosis for the affected kidney is poor. The arterial catheter should be\nremoved in all patients with RAT. Treatment of the thrombus may include thrombolytic therapy, such as tissue\nplasminogen activator, and low molecular weight heparin.\nThe other choices in the vignette such as enlarged kidney on renal ultrasonography, flank mass, and\nperivascular vascular streaks on Doppler renal ultrasonography are typically seen in renal venous thrombosis\n(RVT). In addition, renal ultrasonography may show an enlarged kidney with increased echogenicity and loss of\ncorticomedullary differentiation. Though this condition can also present with hypertension and gross hematuria,\nit is not associated with an umbilical arterial catheter. Other risk factors associated with RVT are infant of\ndiabetic mother, sepsis and shock, dehydration, prematurity, polycythemia, and presence of prothrombotic\nconditions such as factor V Leiden mutation and protein C resistance. There are a variety of different acute\ntreatment strategies for RVT, including supportive care, thrombolytic agents, and unfractionated or low\nmolecular weight heparin.

    "explanation": "D. spironolactone\nInterstitial edema is one of the hallmark findings of nephrotic syndrome (NS). There are 2 different theories as\nto the cause of sodium retention and the development of edema with NS: the underfill and the overfill\nhypotheses.\nAccording to the underfill hypothesis, the low oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia leads to a shift of fluid\ninto the interstitium from the vascular space with resultant intravascular hypovolemia. This underfilling of the\nvascular space leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and secondary sodium retention.\nIn contrast, the overfill hypothesis proposes that there is primary sodium retention directly related to the renal\ndisease of the NS, leading to hypervolemia and edema.\nEvidence supporting the underfill hypothesis includes the fact that many patients with NS, especially from\nminimal change disease, have low urinary sodium excretion and elevated plasma renin activity levels. In a study\nof patients with NS and edema, those patients with signs and symptoms of hypovolemia (tachycardia, peripheral\nvasoconstriction) had higher plasma aldosterone, norepinephrine, and renin activity levels and lower fractional\nexcretion of sodium (FENa less than 0.2%), which was not explained by differences in proteinuria or\nhypoproteinemia compared to those without symptoms. Raising the intravascular oncotic pressure by\nintravenous albumin administration can increase urinary sodium excretion in these hypovolemic NS patients\nand lead to some resolution of edema. However, this response to albumin infusion is seen primarily in those NS\npatients with edema and hypovolemia, and not in patients with edema and hypervolemia.\nEvidence supporting the overfill hypothesis of nephrotic syndrome includes experimental evidence in animals\nand observations in humans. In experimental models inducing unilateral nephrotic syndrome in rats, there is\nincreased activity of the sodium-potassium (Na-K) ATPase pump in the cortical collecting duct of the nephrotic\nkidney not seen in the unaffected contralateral kidney or even other segments of the affected kidney. It is\nunclear if this is the primary cause of sodium retention or simply a secondary marker. Increased activity of the\nepithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the cortical collecting duct, which also contributes to sodium retention, has\nalso been observed in human and animal studies.\nDifficulty lies in discerning between NS patients with underfilling, or volume contraction, from\nhypoalbuminemia and those with overfilling, or volume expansion, from primary sodium retention. These 2\nstates may vary among patients with NS, as well as within the same patient with different relapses. In general,\nadults with NS predominantly have volume expansion. An analysis of nearly 220 NS patients (most of which\nwere adults) showed that 67% of these patients were normo- or hypervolemic. In contrast, children are more\nlikely to have a greater degree of hypoalbuminemia and underfilling, though overfilling also comprises a\n\nsignificant fraction. A study in children with NS and recent relapse had 62% of children with edema also\ndisplaying frank signs of hypovolemia.\nThe clinical importance in making this determination lies in the ability to tolerate diuretic therapy alone or with\ncolloid infusions. The volume-contracted NS patient is already at risk for hypoperfusion of the kidneys and\nthromboembolic complications that may be further increased by treatment with diuretics alone without albumin\ninfusions. Similarly, the volume-expanded NS patient may tolerate additional diuretics well, but is placed at risk\nfor hypertension or pulmonary edema with albumin infusions. Therefore, additional markers to determine\nvolume status may be essential for use in children with NS. Vasoactive hormone (plasma renin activity,\nnorepinephrine, aldosterone) levels may be helpful, but are not timely to be clinically useful. The patient’s\nhematocrit and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio may be elevated with volume contraction and has been used\nas a possible indicator, though they have not been studied for specificity in this population. A study in children\nwith NS showed that a FENa less than 0.2%, much lower than the normal threshold of 1% used in non-\nnephrotic children, served well as a cutoff for volume contraction, correlating inversely to vasoactive hormone\nlevels. Inferior vena cava diameter on echocardiogram has also shown utility in one study.\nIn the same study evaluating the treatment of edema in children with NS only with diuretics, the use of a loop\ndiuretic with a potassium-sparing diuretic (spironolactone, in particular) had equivalent efficacy in patients with\nvolume expansion as the use of albumin and a loop diuretic in patients with volume contraction. In fact, there\nwas modest improvement in average weight loss and length of hospitalization, which was not of statistical\nsignificance, in the group treated with dual diuretics compared to those receiving colloid and a single diuretic.\nIn this clinical vignette, the patient with a history of steroid-responsive NS has symptoms of possible\nhypervolemia, with a normal heart rate but mildly elevated blood pressure and tachypnea. Additionally, the\npatient’s blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio is not elevated at 20 and the urinary excretion of sodium remains\nrelatively elevated with the urine sodium of 140 mEq/L (140 mmol/L) and FENa of 1.0%. Thus, this NS patient\nseems to have more issues with hypervolemia or overfilling and would likely benefit more from the use of\nspironolactone. As spironolactone has effects on ENaC in the cortical collecting duct, it may directly address\none of the purported contributing factors to the overfilling seen in NS. Spironolactone and other diuretics, when\nused long term, can have adverse effects that need monitoring.\nIn the setting of hypervolemia described in this vignette, the use of albumin is likely to worsen the clinical\nsymptoms of prehypertension and pulmonary edema. As the intravascular oncotic pressure is suddenly raised\nwith the infusion of colloid, fluid will rapidly shift from the interstitium to the intravascular space more quickly\nthan the kidneys will excrete any excess fluid. Additionally, standard albumin contains a large amount of\nsodium bound to the albumin, so an infusion will also increase the total body sodium in a setting of sodium\nretention.\n\nOther useful interventions to the edema in steroid-responsive NS, whether from underfilling or overfilling,\nwould include the initiation of corticosteroid therapy and limitation of dietary sodium intake. The induction of\nremission by steroids is accompanied by a significant diuresis of fluids and resolution of the edema.\nInterestingly, the peak of diuresis may occur before the rise in serum oncotic pressure. Restriction of dietary\nsodium to 2,000 mg daily would also aid in reduction of edema in NS, whether the patient is hyper- or\nhypovolemic, and is recommended for all NS patients in relapse.\nThe use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor such as lisinopril has been shown to cause benefit in\nslowing any progression of chronic kidney disease by decreasing albuminuria. A theoretical additional benefit is\nthat this decrease in proteinuria may eventually lead to an increase in plasma albumin levels and oncotic\npressure, which could enhance diuretic response. However, this beneficial response is not immediate and is\nunlikely to occur before the effects of steroid therapy in NS patients that are responsive.\nMannitol has been used historically as an osmotic agent to avoid issues of rapid free water shifts, such as in\ndisequilibrium syndrome. It has very little effect on intravascular oncotic pressure. Mannitol has been used as a\ndiuretic, as it can promote shifting of free water from the interstitium to the intravascular space, though this\neffect is often very mild and seen primarily in hypoosmolar conditions. However, the increase in serum\nosmolarity from mannitol is associated with a risk of hypertension and pulmonary edema. In this vignette, with\na hypervolemic patient, the symptoms of hypervolemia may be further magnified with very little improvement\nin diuresis and edema.\nSulfisoxazole is a sulfa-based antibiotic that has been shown to block the albumin-binding of furosemide. As\nthere is a high level of albumin in the tubular lumen in nephrotic syndrome, in vivo experiments have shown\nthat intraluminal albumin diminishes the response to furosemide in the loop of Henle, so it has been theorized\nthat sulfisoxazole may disinhibit this response. However, in studies with small numbers of patients, the\nadministration of sulfisoxazole had no effect on the diuretic response.\n* Required * Take Survey\nPREP Pearls\n Patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) may present clinically with either hypervolemic or hypovolemic\nsymptoms. Adults with NS generally present with hypervolemia, while children with NS are more likely, but not\nexclusively, to present with hypovolemia.\n All patients with NS and edema would benefit from the use of a loop diuretic and restriction of dietary sodium\nintake. Those patients with signs and symptoms of hypovolemia would likely benefit from administration of\nintravenous albumin to promote diuresis, while those patients with signs of hypervolemia would likely benefit\nmore from diuretic use only.\n A fractional excretion of sodium of greater than 0.2%, much lower than the standard of 1%, has been used as a\ncutoff for determining volume expansion versus volume contraction in children with NS.\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Plan the treatment of edema in nephrotic syndrome\nSuggested Readings\n Deschênes G, Feraille E, Doucet A.

      "X-linking recessive hypoparathyroidism Answer D A narrow range of extracellular calcium concentrations provides for cell stability and is maintained by an intricate homeostatic system. The etiology of hypocalcemia can be related to failure of a component of this system, such as deficiency or of resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) or vitamin D, or a defect of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Factitious hypocalcemia can occur in the face of hypoalbuminemia and corrected by the following formula: (4 g/dL – Measured [Albumin]) x 0.8 + Calcium (mg/dL). The primary determinant of signs and symptoms in patients with hypocalcemia is the serum ionized calcium concentration. A low serum ionized calcium concentration results from either decreased entry of calcium into the circulation such as gastrointestinal malabsorption, decreased bone reabsorption (for example, due to hypoparathyroidism or hypovitaminosis D or increased loss of ionized calcium from the circulation such as deposition in tissue), loss in urine, or increased binding of calcium in serum. There are 2 major causes of hypocalcemia: first, hypocalcemia with a low PTH level (hypoparathyroidism), and second, hypocalcemia with a high PTH level. In addition, there are several miscellaneous causes of hypocalcemia. Causes of hypocalcemia with a low PTH (hypoparathyroidism): Hypoparathyroidism can be classified by its pathogenesis including impaired synthesis or secretion of parathyroid hormone due to lack or loss of the parathyroid gland or to a defect in the synthesis or release of PTH, which can be either a primary or acquired condition or can be due to defects in the CaSR or related proteins. A similar clinical picture can be caused by end-organ resistance to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism), which is distinguished by high rather than low PTH.  Several genetic defects have been identified in patients with hypoparathyroidism including DiGeorge syndrome, which results from parathyroid aplasia or hypoplasia. Hypocalcemia also occurs in HRD (hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal dysplasia) syndrome, which is an autosomal dominant condition. Mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor and related proteins also cause hypocalcemia. Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is most frequently caused by an activating mutation of the CaSR, which is known as ADH1. The activating mutation causes hypocalcemia by shifting the set point of CaSR, such that PTH is not released at serum calcium concentrations that normally trigger PTH release. ADH2 is caused by activating mutations in the α subunit of GNA11. X-linked recessive hypoparathyroidism caused by a deletion-insertion rearrangement involving chromosomes Xq27.1 and 2p25.3 has also been described.  Mitochondrial disorders have been associated with hypoparathyroidism including Kearns-Sayre syndrome characterized by ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary degeneration of the retina, and cardiomyopathy, mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency, which is a fatty acid oxidation disorder that can present either as a severe condition with neonatal cardiomyopathy and sudden death, infantile onset of a hepatic Reye-like syndrome, or late adolescent onset of skeletal myopathy.  Autoimmune mechanisms can cause hypocalcemia from hypoparathyroidism as an acquired disease. Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 is also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) syndrome. In this disease, immunologic destruction of the parathyroid gland occurs in association with destruction of other endocrine glands. APECED appears to be a result of mutations in AIRE (autoimmune regulator gene), which is expressed in the thymus, lymph nodes, pancreas, adrenal cortex, and fetal liver.  Other acquired mechanisms include parathyroidectomy to remove a parathyroid adenoma or hyperplastic gland, iron deposition in the parathyroid gland in patients requiring chronic transfusions, copper deposition in patients with Wilson disease, Gram-negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and HIV infection may also be complicated by hypocalcemia through mechanisms that include impaired PTH secretion and resistance. Causes of hypocalcemia with a high PTH: Hypocalcemia with elevated serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) can be caused by insufficient intake or hydroxylation of vitamin D (hypovitaminosis D); insufficient dietary calcium intake; end-organ resistance to vitamin D (hereditary resistance to vitamin D); end-organ resistance to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism); or loss of calcium in the circulation.  Clinical deficiency of vitamin D is identified by decreased concentrations of the most abundant circulating vitamin D metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This disorder is characterized by elevated PTH and normal or low serum inorganic phosphorus levels, and can cause the clinical syndrome of rickets. The circulating 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D level is not a useful discriminant for this condition and may be low, normal, or elevated. Vitamin D deficiency is usually a function of decreased intake, but limited sunlight (exposure to ultraviolet [UV] radiation) may also cause vitamin D deficiency. Other conditions that may also cause reduced 25- hydroxyvitamin D stores include decreased intestinal absorption of vitamin D or increased catabolism of vitamin D and its metabolites by the liver, or insufficient hydroxylation of vitamin D due to severe renal or hepatic dysfunction. In the United States, most vitamin D is derived from foods that have a high content of the vitamin such as fatty fishes or are fortified with the vitamin such as milk and milk products. The remainder is synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol under the influence of UV light. Therefore, vitamin D deficiency can occur in children whose dietary intake is low and/or who live without sun exposure. In infants who are exclusively breastfed, vitamin D deficiency can occur if vitamin D supplementation is not provided, especially in dark-skinned infants during the winter months. Vitamin D deficiency is also caused by decreased absorption from the gastrointestinal tract because of gastrectomy, celiac disease, malabsorption, extensive bowel surgery, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or pancreatic insufficiency, as seen in cystic fibrosis.  Disturbances in the metabolism of vitamin D may also lead to hypocalcemia generating compensatory PTH secretion. In the liver, vitamin D undergoes 25-hydroxylation to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This conversion can be impaired in patients with severe liver disease. The final and rate-limiting step in vitamin D metabolism is the 1-hydroxylation of 25- hydroxyvitamin D in the kidney to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the most biologically active metabolite of vitamin D. This reaction is stimulated by PTH and hypophosphatemia, but inhibited by calcium, phosphate, or fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). In patients with renal failure, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production is low because of the reduced expression of the 1- hydroxylase as a consequence of renal failure, elevated circulating levels of FGF23, and hyperphosphatemia. Thus, vitamin D plays a role in the development of the bone disease seen in chronic kidney disease.  1-α-hydroxylase deficiency and hereditary resistance to vitamin D (HRVD) are distinct disorders characterized by hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and rickets, with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Rickets caused by these disorders were originally described as vitamin D \"dependent\" rickets because of their favorable response to pharmacologic doses of vitamin D. 1-α-hydroxylase deficiency, which was previously known as vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1 or pseudo-vitamin D-deficient rickets, is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CYP27B1, which encodes the 1-α- hydroxylase enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D. The defective enzyme has impaired binding to either the substrate, 25- hydroxyvitamin D, or a requisite cofactor. The disorder is characterized by hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and high PTH and alkaline phosphatase concentrations, with evidence of rickets. Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are not low, whereas the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration may be decreased. This disorder can be treated with small doses of oral 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  Hereditary resistance to vitamin D, which was previously known as vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2, is caused by end-organ resistance to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, most often because of biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor (VDR), located in chromosome region 12q13-14. The clinical findings of HRVD are similar to those observed in 1-α-hydroxylase deficiency (hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and high PTH and alkaline phosphatase concentrations), except that serum 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D concentrations are high rather than low. In addition to rickets, many of the patients have alopecia. End-organ resistance to PTH, also known as pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP), refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders defined by targeted organ (kidney and bone) unresponsiveness to PTH. There are several types of PHP, including type 1 which has several subtypes (type 1a, 1b, and 1c) and type 2. Miscellaneous causes of hypocalcemia: There are several miscellaneous causes of hypocalcemia.  Hungry bone syndrome refers to a phase of avid bone mineralization, with hypocalcemia due to rapid movement of calcium from the circulation into the skeletal compartment; this tends to occur during the early phases of recovery from a severe mineralization defect, or after a prolonged period of calcium resorption from bone.  Osteopetrosis may result in significant loss of osteoclast function and decrease in bone resorption such that calcium mobilization from the skeleton is sufficiently impaired as to result in hypocalcemia.  Hypocalcemia may be triggered by Gram-negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), or severe burns. Endogenous or exogenous sources of phosphate can create a phosphate load sufficient to exceed the renal capacity for phosphate excretion. The ensuing hyperphosphatemia may result in calcium-phosphate precipitation in the tissues leading to symptomatic hypocalcemia.  Administration of large volumes of intravenous products that contain citrate (eg, blood products) or lactate may decrease the serum ionized calcium concentration, through increased binding of calcium into calcium-citrate or calcium-lactate complexes.  Pancreatitis can cause hypocalcemia.  Drugs that may cause hypocalcemia include bisphosphonates, calcimimetics, the antiviral agent foscarnet, and some chemotherapeutic drugs.  Rarely, excess intake of fluoride can cause hypocalcemia; this effect is presumably mediated by inhibition of bone resorption.  Magnesium is required for PTH release and may be required for PTH effect on target organs. Hypomagnesemia can lead to hypocalcemia through several mechanisms, In the vignette, an activating mutation of the CaSR, DiGeorge syndrome, mitochondrial myopathy, and X-linked recessive hypoparathyroidism are incorrect answers because the PTH is low to normal in these conditions. PREP Pearls  A tightly regulated extracellular ionized calcium concentration promotes cell function and survival and is maintained by an intricate calcium homeostatic system. The primary determinant of symptomatic hypocalcemia is the serum ionized calcium concentration.  A variety of genetic and acquired disorders can cause hypocalcemia. The different causes can be clinically distinguished by differences in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), phosphate, and vitamin D concentrations.  Hypoparathyroidism, a major cause of pediatric hypocalcemia, is caused by impaired secretion or production of PTH or a defect in the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) that regulates PTH secretion. Hypoparathyroidism is distinguished clinically by hypocalcemia with low levels of PTH.  Hypocalcemia with high levels of PTH may be caused by vitamin D deficiency or defects in its metabolism or action and genetic mutations causing deficiency of 1-α-hydroxylase.  Miscellaneous causes of hypocalcemia include hungry bone syndrome osteopetrosis, sepsis or acute severe illness, hyperphosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and some drugs.

      "congenital adrenal hyperplasia",
      "primary adrenal insufficiency",
      "pseudohyperkalemia",
      "pyelonephritis",
      "renal failure Answer D The most likely etiology for hyperkalemia in this febrile newborn with leukocytosis and laboratory evidence of a urinary tract infection is pyelonephritis. Infants are particularly at risk for hyperkalemia when they present with an acute febrile urinary tract infection and are even more at risk if they have concomitant urologic disease. The mechanism by which pyelonephritis leads to hyperkalemia in this young patient population is thought to be via interstitial inflammation, exacerbating the normally present diminished aldosterone responsiveness in infants. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and primary adrenal insufficiency are not likely in this child without history of weight loss, without examination findings of hypotension, dehydration, or ambiguous genitalia (seen with CAH), and with normal blood glucose. Pseudohyperkalemia is not likely because no hemolysis was noted. Finally, a serum creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL (53 µmol/L) is within the range of normal for a 1-week-old newborn and does not suggest renal failure as a cause. Hyperkalemia is a common laboratory abnormality encountered in pediatric patients, particularly in infants and young children. A major cause for an elevated potassium is pseudohyperkalemia: either a spuriously elevated potassium due to hemolysis during the phlebotomy procedure, elevated potassium related to patient resistance/restraint, or due to entities such as extreme leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, spherocytosis, or familial pseudohyperkalemia. In each of these scenarios, the true intravascular potassium concentration is normal. The procedure by which the specimen is procured and stored leads to extracellular efflux of potassium resulting in elevated laboratory values. With traumatic phlebotomy, there is hemolysis during the procedure leading to release of potassium into the serum or plasma. With limb restraint and repetitive movement, muscle cells can release potassium, thereby elevating the potassium concentration of the blood sample. Individuals with autosomal dominant familial pseudohyperkalemia or with hereditary spherocytosis have elevated potassium levels due to efflux of intracellular potassium when the temperature drops below 22°C. Outside of pseudohyperkalemia, the etiology of hyperkalemia in children can be thought of as due to one of the following: increased intake, decreased excretion, or transcellular movement from the intracellular to the extracellular space. In general, individuals can tolerate a relatively large potassium load due to homeostatic mechanisms that regulate potassium balance. On rare occasions, these homeostatic mechanisms can be overwhelmed, particularly when the potassium load is delivered by intravenous fluids, medications, or nutrition, or by a large packed red blood cell transfusion. If correctly prescribed, these interventions should not lead to a chronic elevation in potassium in a normal host. Infants and small children are particularly vulnerable to potassium loads because they have a smaller volume of distribution than larger children and adolescents and individuals with chronic kidney disease who are also vulnerable due to impaired renal excretion of potassium. Decreased excretion of potassium primarily occurs with some degree of renal dysfunction both with acute and chronic kidney disease. With kidney disease, there is either a reduction of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and/or there is some degree of tubular dysfunction. Hyperkalemia tends to manifest when the GFR decreases to 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or lower. When filtration is reduced to this extent, there is decreased delivery of sodium to the distal tubules, which leads to decreased urinary excretion of potassium. Tubular dysfunction results when there is either aldosterone deficiency or resistance. In general, among individuals with preserved renal function and renal blood flow, aldosterone resistance or deficiency results in a small increase in potassium. This is because hyperkalemia itself stimulates potassium secretion independently of aldosterone. There are several ways in which tubular dysfunction can lead to hyperkalemia in children (Table 2). Transcellular movement of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space can occur with cell lysis or tissue breakdown. In general, this needs to be a rapid process or on a large scale to produce hyperkalemia. Some examples of when this can occur include tumor lysis syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, muscle injury from extreme exercise, and hemolysis. Additionally, hyperkalemia can occur with metabolic acidosis. When acidosis is present, extracellular hydrogen ions move intracellularly in exchange for potassium to maintain acid-base balance and electroneutrality, thereby elevating extracellular potassium levels. Further, metabolic acidosis often occurs with dehydration and decreased GFR. With decreased GFR, renal potassium excretion also decreases, exacerbating the elevated extracellular potassium load. Finally, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (Gamstorp disease) is another entity with hyperkalemia caused by the transcellular relocation of potassium. This autosomal dominant disorder presents in infancy or early childhood with episodic extreme muscle weakness or paralysis and elevated potassium levels. Triggers include increased dietary potassium intake, stress, exposure to cold temperature, and fatigue. PREP Pearls  A major cause for an elevated potassium in children is pseudohyperkalemia: either a spuriously elevated potassium due to hemolysis during the phlebotomy procedure, elevated potassium related to patient resistance/restraint, extreme leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, or due to hereditary entities such as spherocytosis or familial pseudohyperkalemia. In each of these scenarios, the true intravascular potassium concentration is normal.  Outside of pseudohyperkalemia, the etiology of hyperkalemia in children can be thought of as due to one of the following: increased intake, decreased excretion, or transcellular movement from the intracellular to the extracellular space.  Pyelonephritis can cause hyperkalemia in infants via interstitial inflammation, exacerbating the normally present diminished aldosterone responsiveness in this young patient population.

      "factor H is an important inhibitor of complement pathway activation Answer E The complement system (Figure) is a set of soluble circulating proteins that form a part of the body’s defenses to foreign invaders, such as pathogenic microbes. Complement proteins are highly conserved across species. They exhibit characteristics that classify them as part of the innate, not adaptive immune system: recognition of a variety of danger signals, an early response, lack of memory, and lack of accelerated recall response. The complement proteins function as a cascade, with some intermediaries exhibiting biologic activity of their own and each leading to a downstream molecule. The cascade ends in the final soluble membrane attack complex C5b-9 (not C5a-9), which is responsible for creating pores in the invader’s cell membrane, an important step towards destruction of the undesirable invader. Three different pathways to initiate the complement cascade exist (classical, alternative and lectin binding), each converging at the junction point C3, also known as C3 convertase (not C2). The complement system is constitutively turned on at all times; regulator proteins therefore perform an important role in suppressing overactivity. Among these negative regulators are factor H, factor B, membrane cofactor, and thrombomodulin. Mutations in any of these regulator proteins lead to excess complement activity, best characterized in the disease states paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. However, because the complement system functions as an end effector mechanism for many immune pathways, many other diseases such as lupus nephritis and transplant rejection can also involve the complement pathway. Of the various complement proteins, C4d (not C3d) remains deposited in peritubular capillaries for a relatively longer half-life. Therefore, the detection of C4d in transplant biopsies is used as a criterion for the diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection. In the vignette, the patient has a primary disease of lupus nephritis and now has features to suggest a post-transplant de novo thrombotic microangiopathy. Both entities are characterized by complement cascade activity. Of the vignette choices, only response choice E is a correct statement.

      "the polarity genes are not conserved across species",
      "tight junctions are formed after adherens junctions Answer E Polarity is vital for directional solute transport. Loss of polarity in the setting of acute kidney injury results in tubular back leak and impaired reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubule. Apical mislocalization of sodium-potassium-ATPase leads to increased fractional excretion of sodium. Mammalian epithelial cells are highly polarized and have distinct apical and basolateral plasma membranes with different sets of transmembrane proteins and associated complexes (Figure). The initial polarization of epithelial cells is driven by spatial clues derived from cell-cell contacts and cell- extracellular matrix (ECM) contacts. Cell-cell contacts are mainly mediated by calcium-dependent interactions via transmembrane adhesion molecules of the cadherin superfamily, whereas cell-ECM contacts are mediated by transmembrane receptors of the integrin family. Development of epithelial cell polarity proceeds through 2 stages. Initially, cadherin-containing cell contacts, so-called adherens junctions or zonula adherens, are scattered along the lateral plasma membrane. At this stage, the tight junction has not yet formed. Assembly of the tight junction begins after the adherens junctions are assembled to form the zonula adherens. This series of events is not only observed in cultured epithelial cells, but also during mammalian development. Accordingly, tight junction formation succeeds, not precedes, adherens junction formation. The mechanisms responsible for separating adherens junction and tight junction components during ontogeny of cell polarity are not completely known. However, a protein complex consisting of mammalian homologs of partitioning defective PAR-3, PAR-6, Cdc42, and an aPKC (atypical protein kinase C) is crucial to this process. Jam-1, a transmembrane adhesion molecule localized to the tight junction, links the PAR/aPKC/Cdc42 complex to the integral tight junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin. It is likely that phosphorylation of some tight junction components by aPKC is critical in the assembly of tight junctions. On the other hand, cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion can activate Cdc42, which explains the functional coordination between cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and tight junction assembly. Although the initial cues to establishing epithelial cell polarity may be different in between species, the effector genes are well conserved. PREP Pearls  Cell-cell adhesions and cell-matrix interactions are the initial spatial clues to establishing epithelial cells polarity.  During development of epithelial cell polarity, adherens junctions form first followed later by tight junctions; the 2 complexes communicate.  Polarity genes are conserved among different species.

      "suprarenal aortic coarctation Answer D The patient in the vignette has hypertension with elevated serum potassium. He has a family history of hypertension. The only monogenetic cause of hypertension with an elevated potassium is pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII) or Gordon syndrome. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Clinically, the patients have suppressed renin with volume expansion and hypertension. As in this case, the aldosterone levels are relatively suppressed considering the hyperkalemia. Clinically, these patients respond well to salt restriction and low-dose thiazide diuretics. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II can be caused by mutations in the gene encoding with no lysine kinases (WNK). They are part of a regulatory cascade that controls the thiazide-sensitive sodium/chloride cotransporter (NCC) in the distal convoluted tubule (Figure). Mutations of WNK1 or WNK4 increase the expression of the NCC on the luminal membrane. For example, WNK4 functions by directing the trafficking of NCC to the lysosome rather than the luminal membrane. Mutations in the acidic motif of WNK4 do not impact its kinase activity, but increase NCC expression (localization) on the luminal membrane causing PHAII. The WNK kinases are also present in the collecting duct. There they function to regulate the secretory potassium channel (ROMK channel) and mutations in the WNK4 protein causing pseudohypoaldosteronism reduce the number of ROMK channels. The reduction in ROMK channels coupled with the reduction in the lumen-negative potential (due to increased sodium reabsorption) results in hyperkalemia. Other genes have also been implicated in the regulation of WNK proteins. Cullin3 (CUL3) and Kelch- like family member 3 (KLHL3) are involved the endosomal degradation of WNK proteins and have been implicated in causing some forms of PHAII. Disease-causing mutations function to increase levels of WNKs. Mutations in these genes may actually account for more cases of PHAII syndrome than mutations in WNK genes and may also cause severe early PHAII. In a study of 52 PHAII kindreds with 126 affected individuals, approximately one-third were due to CUL3 mutations, whereas only 13% were due to WNK1 or WNK4 mutations. The remainder were due to KLHL3 mutations. Interestingly, although PHAII is classically described as an autosomal dominant disease, 8 of the 24 patients with KLHL3 mutations had autosomal recessive disease. Overall, the patients with CUL3 mutations presented younger (approximately 9 years of age) with higher potassium (approximately 7.5 mEq/L [7.5 mmol/L]) and lower bicarbonate (approximately 15 mEq/L [15 mmol/L]). Patients with other mutations (WNK1, WNK4, KLHL3) presented in the 20- to 30-year- old range group with potassium in the high 5s to low 6s range and bicarbonate levels in the high teens to low 20s range. In this case with the mild presentation but relatively young age, this patient potentially could have had any mutations, but a CUL3 mutation may be less likely. This patient is overweight (body mass index between 85th to less than 95th percentile) and not obese because his body mass index is less than the 95th percentile. The finding of 2 simple cysts in a teenager without a family history of autosomal dominant polycystic (ADPKD) kidney disease is not diagnostic of ADPKD and one would not expect hyperkalemia in presence of normal renal function. Suprarenal aortic coarctation as a cause for hypertension is very unlikely because of the 4 limb blood pressure readings. In pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (PHAI) there is a defect in either one the genes coding for a ENaC channel component (autosomal recessive with proteins expressed in sweat gland, lung, salivary glands, and kidney) or the mineralocorticoid receptor protein (autosomal dominant with renal limited phenotype). Clinically, PHAI patients have polyuria, sodium wasting, and hyperkalemia. These patients have volume depletion and do not develop hypertension.

      "rituximab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the CD19 receptor on B cells Answer D Several biologic antibody preparations have been used in immunologic kidney disease, especially in kidney transplantation (Table). Many of these agents were initially developed to treat lymphomas. The rationale behind their use is to lyse or inactivate critical immune cells that are believed to be harmful in the disease process. In transplantation, antibody preparations are considered to be more potent than oral “maintenance” agents. This concept was initially validated by the superior outcome results of a polyclonal anti- lymphocyte globulin (ALG) preparation at the University of Minnesota when compared to regimens without induction. Antibody preparations can be used as induction therapy at time of transplantation or as rescue therapy during an acute rejection episode. Note that approximately 75% to 80% of patients (not everyone) currently receive an induction agent. Polyclonal agents target a long list of multiple receptors on various immune cells and therefore inactivate multiple immune cell types, including T and B cells and NK cells. These agents are considered more potent than monoclonal agents but may also carry a higher infection/malignancy risk. The ALG was largely replaced by a horse derived polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), which in turn has largely been replaced by a rabbit-derived polyclonal ATG, the latter having the lowest frequency of infusion-related febrile and serum sickness reactions. Thymoglobulin is currently approved in the United States only for rescue therapy in kidney transplantation, not as an induction agent. The first monoclonal antibody developed and used in kidney transplantation was OKT3 or muromonab. It specifically targeted the CD3 receptor on T cells, thought to be the central point of immune activation against alloantigens. It was used both as rescue therapy for acute rejection and as an induction agent. This agent was not very successful and was associated with more complications, so it fell out of favor and is no longer available. Subsequently, newer monoclonal agents were developed that were targeted towards the IL2 receptor (also known as CD25) expressed primarily on activated T cells. These agents were daclizumab and basiliximab, of which the latter is still available and used, primarily labeled as an induction agent. These agents are generally considered to be less immunologically potent compared to polyclonal ATGs, and are therefore used in lower risk patients and also believed to have lower complication risk. The other monoclonal agent currently used off-label for either induction or rescue therapy is alemtuzumab, an antibody targeted to CD52, expressed on many types of immune cells. Alemtuzumab depletes the immune cells for a prolonged period and is therefore considered the most potent of the antibody preparations. Besides its use as an induction agent, it has also been used as rescue therapy after antibody-mediated rejection. Rituximab was developed as a biologic antibody that targets pre-B cells, and had been used off-label both for rescue therapy in antibody-mediated rejection and for induction. It targets the CD20 receptor expressed on pre-B cells. Note that lymphocyte subset assays in clinical practice often use CD19 to detect peripheral circulating B cell populations. Bortezomib is another agent that is used off-label in refractory antibody-mediated rejection because it targets plasma cells, the cells that manufacture antibodies. It is not a cell surface receptor biological antibody, but instead is a boron-containing chemical compound (C H BN O that functions as an 19 25 4 4) intracellular proteasome inhibitor. More specifically, bortezomib is reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells, leading to targeted proteolysis and cell death. Belatacept is a fusion protein that was developed to bind and send negative signals through the CD28- B7 costimulatory pathways between antigen presenting cells and T cells, thereby inactivating the latter. Unlike the other injectable agents mentioned previously, it is meant to be a monthly maintenance agent. It does not have any effect on the CD40-CD154 costimulatory pathway. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and binds the complement component C5, preventing its cleavage to C5a and C5b and also preventing the formation of the downstream complement end product C5b-9, the membrane attack complex. In the vignette, response choices A and D are incorrect because alemtuzumab and bortezomib are not polyclonal antibodies, response choice C is incorrect because belatacept does not target the CD40 pathway, and response choice E is incorrect because rituximab targets CD20, not CD19. PREP Pearls  Multiple polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparations are available for use in immunological conditions affecting the kidney.  Polyclonal agents target a wider cell population, while monoclonal agents may target a specific cell type or multiple cell types, depending upon where the epitope is expressed.  Each agent has advantages, disadvantages, and limitations.

      "X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets Answer D *(Note its written in PREP the (answer C) but according to the explanation below the answer is D, a notification was sent to them ) Bowing of the legs and frontal bossing are two of several physical examination findings that can be found in a child with rickets. Other physical examination findings include: - Delayed closure of fontanelles - Parietal bossing - “Rachitic Rosary”: costochondral junction enlargement - Wrist widening Radiological findings consistent with rickets are best identified in the distal ulna and above and below the knee. Changes that may be present include: - epiphyseal plate widening - lack of definition of the zone of provisional calcification at the interface of the epiphyseal and metaphyseal plates - growth plate disorganization as evidenced by cupping, splaying, and cortical spurs When presented with a possible case of rickets, initial laboratory investigation should include assessment of alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone level. Consistent with all causes of rickets is an elevated alkaline phosphatase. The other laboratory findings help narrow your differential diagnosis and will guide further testing (Table). The child in this vignette has clinical, laboratory, and radiological evidence for hypophosphatemic rickets. His normal intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) and normal calcium make calcipenic rickets unlikely. When faced with hypophosphatemic rickets, additional laboratory examination is needed to determine the underlying etiology. Essential to this workup is an assessment of the urine to investigate for urinary losses of phosphate, calcium, amino acids, bicarbonate, and glucose. Renal Fanconi syndrome is a known cause of hypophosphatemic rickets and is associated with glucosuria, urinary losses of amino acids and phosphorous, and renal tubular acidosis. To determine if there are inappropriately high urinary phosphorus losses in a child with hypophosphatemia, one can calculate the tubular reabsorption of phosphorous (TRP): TRP% = 1 – [(Upo4 x Pcr)/(Ppo4 x Ucr)] x 100 Upo = urinary concentration of phosphate Pcr = plasma creatinine Ppo4 = plasma concentration of phosphate Ucr = urinary concentration of creatinine The tubular reabsorption of phosphorus helps distinguish between low delivery of phosphorus (low dietary phosphate content) where one would expect an elevated tubular reabsorption of phosphorus as the kidney attempts to conserve all available phosphorus, and a primary renal etiology, where the tubular reabsorption of phosphorus is inappropriately low. The low tubular reabsorption of phosphorus measured in the vignette eliminates diminished dietary phosphorus as an etiology. This leaves the following possibilities: Hereditary hypophophatemic rickets with hypercalciuria; X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets; and tumor-induced osteomalacia. The normal 1,25-OH vitamin D and normal urinary calcium presented in the vignette eliminates hereditary phosphaturia with hypercalciuria as a possibility. This makes X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets the most likely diagnosis. The clinical characteristics of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is similar to that of autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets. They all present with hypophosphatemia, low tubular reabsorption of phosphorus, low or inappropriately normal 1,25(OH) vitamin D levels, normal intact PTH, normal serum and urinary calcium, and increased or inappropriately normal fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels. The main difference between these entities is the inheritance pattern and the underlying genetic defect. In the X-linked form of hypophosphatemic rickets, there is an inactivating mutation in the Phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases in the X chromosome (PHEX); in the autosomal dominant form, there is a missense mutation in chromosome 12p13.3, which leads to mutations in FGF-23; and in the autosomal recessive form, there is a homozygous mutation that affects the DMP1 gene. PREP Pearls  When evaluating a patient with rickets, it is important to initially determine if they have calcipenic or phosphopenic rickets.  The work up for hypophosphatemic rickets includes urine testing for urinary losses of amino acids, glucose, phosphorous, and calcium.

      "inadequate nutrition Answer B *(Note its written in PREP the (answer E) but according to the explanation below the answer is B, notification was sent to them ) The patient in the vignette has short stature and growth failure. Short stature is defined as 2 standard deviations (SDS) below the mean for age and sex (which correlates of a Z-score of < -1.88). Growth failure is defined as a growth velocity less than 2 SDS below the mean for age and sex. Although the patient is a risk of delayed puberty, the patient has tanner 1 breast development at age 10 years, which is normal. Familial short stature is associated with normal growth velocity. The patient has a weight percentile of 50%, making inadequate nutrition an unlikely cause of impaired growth velocity. The patient has an estimated GFR of 40 mL/min per 1.73m2). Both chronic steroids and decreased GFR are contributors to poor growth after transplant; of the two, GFR accounts for most of the variability and therefore is the preferred answer in this case. Short stature and growth failure is a significant complication of pediatric end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The etiology of growth failure in pediatric ESRD is multifactorial, with contributions of poor nutrition, water and electrolyte disturbances, acidosis, anemia, secondary chronic kidney disease- associated bone and mineral disorders (CKD-BMD), delayed puberty, and growth hormone resistance. In the 1990s, over 70% of patients started on dialysis before the age of 15 years had final adult heights below the third percentile (Z-score < -1.88). Studies have shown that short stature negatively impacts quality of life and self-esteem in patients with childhood-onset ESRD. Growth failure in pediatric ESRD is also associated with increased risk of hospitalization and death, even in those that undergo transplantation. Recent years have shown some improvement in adult height, with final Z-scores of -2 to -3 in the 1990s to -1.4 to -1.8 in the 2000s, which equals about 45% to 75% patients achieving a normal adult height. Improved nutrition, elimination of aluminum exposure (now that other phosphate binders are used), erythropoeitin and recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment, earlier onset of puberty (improved from delayed), and increased preemptive transplants may all have contributed to these improvements. Still, recent studies suggest up to 20% of patients with pediatric onset ESRD will have severe adult height deficits (Z score of -3 or worse) and almost 25% will have moderate adult height deficits (Z score of -1.88 to -3). Even in those that fall into the normal adult height range, final height is often below the mid-parental target height. Earlier-onset ESRD (eg, < 4 years of age) was associated with greater deficits in adult height. Preemptive transplant and longer time with transplant was associated with better height percentile. Studies of improvements in height over the past few decades suggest that the greatest benefit of interventions such as improved nutrition and rhGH are seen prior to the onset of ERSD. Longer duration of rhGH therapy and delayed bone age improves the net growth while on growth hormone. Once on dialysis, longitudinal growth does not usually improve (ie, growth may continue but most often only along the same centiles despite treatment). Many factors affect growth following renal transplantation (Table). “Catch-up” growth following renal transplantation, with increased height velocities of up to 6 to 9 cm/year (above normal growth velocities), occurs in prepubertal children. For patients transplanted before or during puberty, pubertal growth velocities are higher than normal children; however, puberty is delayed and shortened, leading to an approximately 20% decrease in net height gain during puberty compared to healthy controls. Prepubertal and pubertal growth after transplant is affected by transplant kidney function (glomerular filtration rate) and steroid exposure, the former more than the latter, with better kidney function correlating with improved growth. Higher steroid doses also correlate with poorer growth. Recently, steroid avoidance and steroid withdrawal have been used in children in an effort to improve growth. For those younger than 5 years of age, studies suggest height Z-scores improved by approximately 0.5 above steroid-treated patients. The TWIST study showed greatest benefit of steroid avoidance in prepubertal children with Z-scores improving by 0.2 above steroid-treated patients. Alternate day steroids have also been show to improve growth when compared to daily steroids. One potential concern about decreased steroids is frequency of acute rejection and nephrotoxicity of potentially higher doses of immunosuppressants such as calcineurin inhibitors, which may adversely affect GFR. Other studies have examined treatment with rhGH post-transplantation. One concern has been the potential for rhGH leading to increased risk of transplant rejection, which is not supported by most studies. Of note, patients with history of acute rejection prior to rhGH use were at greater risk of episodes of rejection post-rhGH use. Other concerns are potential adverse effects of rhGH, including papilledema and glucose intolerance, but no increased risk has been identified in meta-analyses of patients receiving growth hormone post-transplant. The 2009 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guideline recommends using rhGH for children with persistent growth failure after transplant. In addition, it suggests minimizing or avoiding corticosteroids in those that have growth potential.

    "explanation": "A. technetium Tc 99m–dimercaptosuccinic acid scan\nFor the child in the vignette, ultrasound imaging reveals small for age kidneys that may be asymmetrical. There\nis no hydroureteronephrosis noted, making obstruction and high-grade reflux unlikely. To determine whether\nrenal cortical scarring from previously undiagnosed reflux nephropathy may explain his elevated serum\ncreatinine level and urine findings, a technetium Tc 99m–dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mT -DMSA) scan would\nC\nbe most appropriate. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), technetium Tc 99m–diethylene triamine\npentaacetic acid (99mT -DTPA), and technetium Tc 99m–mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mT -MAG ) scanning are\nC C 3\nnot necessary because there is no concern for reflux based on his renal ultrasound findings. For these reasons,\nthe best imaging modality for the patient described in the vignette is 99mT -DMSA.\nC\nThere are multiple imaging modalities available to evaluate the kidney and urologic tract. The most common\nimaging modality is ultrasonography. Renal and bladder ultrasonography can provide valuable information\nregarding the size and shape of the kidneys and bladder, the potential for vesicoureteral reflux or urinary\nobstruction, and renal blood flow. Qualities that add to its preference as an initial imaging modality include its\nlow cost, that it is painless and radiation free, and that is does not require sedation.\nWhen the clinical history is suggestive of specific diagnoses or when abnormalities are noted on renal\nultrasonography, such as hydroureteronephrosis, bladder thickening or distension, renal size discrepancy,\nincreased renal echogenicity, and/or increased resistive indexes, additional imaging tests are required to further\ndefine renal and urologic abnormalities.\nVCUG is an imaging study used to diagnose vesicoureteral reflux and posterior urethral valve. This study\nrequires the placement of a catheter into the bladder. After catheter placement, the bladder is emptied, and\ncontrast material is instilled to bladder capacity. Under fluoroscopy, multiple images are then taken: during\nfilling to identify filling defects (as might be seen with an ureterocele or bladder tumor), once the bladder is full,\nduring voiding (essential for male children to visualize the urethra), and after voiding. Vesicoureteral reflux, if\npresent, will be identified and then graded.\nWhen there is concern about urinary obstruction or when information is needed regarding differential renal\nfunction or presence of renal cortical scarring, radionuclide imaging can be very useful. However, these\nmodalities do not provide information regarding anatomy and so are often used as a complement to other\nimaging studies.\nThere are 3 main radionuclide tests, each using different radiotracers and slightly different techniques. 99mT -\nC\nDTPA and 99mT -MAG are 2 radiotracers used for dynamic renal scintigraphy, and 99mT -DMSA is used for\nC 3 C\n\nstatic renal cortical scintigraphy. Each of these imaging tests exposes individuals to radiation, although to a\nlesser extent than that experienced with VCUG and computed tomography.\nDynamic renal scintigraphy allows one to determine not only the differential function of each kidney but\nwhether any urinary tract dilatation is due to obstruction of the urinary tract. The main differences between the\n2 radiotracers is that 99mT -DTPA is excreted primarily via glomerular filtration; it is not secreted or reabsorbed\nC\nby the renal tubules. 99mT -MAG , on the other hand, is primarily secreted via the tubules. Because of this,\nC 3\n99mT -MAG is excreted more rapidlyand therefore provides a superior renal/background ratio. With both\nC 3\nradiotracers, a bolus injection is administered, and dynamic images are obtained for 30 minutes. Early images\ninform renal perfusion and differential function, and later images assess excretion. In the instance that the\nradiotracer does not fully drain from the pelvis during imaging, a diuretic can be administered 15 to 20 minutes\nafter the radiotracer infusion. With a nonobstructed system, the radiotracer will then fully drain from the pelvis.\nWith an obstructed system, the radiotracer does not fully drain and remains for longer than 20 minutes. There is\nthe potential for false-positive results with dynamic renal scintigraphy, particularly when faced with very poor\nkidney function or a massively dilated renal pelvis. The risk of obtaining a false-positive result can be decreased\nby voiding before the start of the study and upright positioning to facilitate gravitational drainage. In infants, a\nurine catheter may be needed to ensure bladder emptying.\nRenal cortical scintigraphy is preferred when the clinical question aims to answer whether an individual has\nrenal cortical scarring or acute pyelonephritis. 99mT -DMSA (or glucoheptonate when 99mT -DMSA is not\nC C\navailable) is the radiotracer used for this study, and this tracer is taken up by the cells in the proximal tubule.\nThe accumulation of 99mT -DMSA within the proximal tubular cells, where it binds to sulfhydryl groups, is\nC\nrelatively slow. As such, imaging takes place 1.5 to 3 hours after injection of radiotracer. Further delay in\nimaging may be warranted in instances of severely impaired renal function to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This\nimaging provides information about the renal cortex, with areas of decreased uptake suggestive of renal cortical\nscarring or acute pyelonephritis. This imaging cannot differentiate between the two, however, and there are\nseveral anatomical findings that can affect the interpretation of results. Fetal lobulations may result in\nphotopenic defects suggestive of scar or infection. The superolateral surface of the left kidney may be flattened\nbecause of splenic compression, affecting the scintigraphic images. In addition, normal kidneys may have\ndecreased radiotracer uptake of the upper poles.\nThat said, one can also see deficient radiotracer uptake with renal cysts, cortical infarct, hydronephrosis, and\nmasses. These findings can only be confirmed by alternative imaging modalities.\nWith each of these radionuclide imaging studies, information is provided about differential renal function.\nDifferential function is calculated by outlining the appropriate area of the kidneys in the posterior image and\nthen subtracting from that the appropriate background area activity. With ectopic kidneys, there needs to be\n\nadditional correction for attenuation. This correction cannot be done with pelvic kidneys because of the\npresence of the pelvic bone. Finally, when attempting to determine split function in an obstructed system,\nimages should be delayed up to 24 hours so as to not overestimate the degree of function in the obstructed\nkidney. Mean (SD) normal split function is 50% (6%).\nPREP Pearls\n Dynamic renal scintigraphy with technetium Tc 99m–diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (99mT -DTPA) or\nC\ntechnetium Tc 99m–mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mT -MAG ) is useful for the diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction\nC 3\nand differential kidney function.\n Renal cortical scintigraphy with technetium Tc 99m–dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mT -DMSA) provides information\nC\nabout differential renal function and the renal cortex, with areas of decreased uptake suggestive of renal cortical\nscarring or acute pyelonephritis.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the indications for and limitations of different radionuclide scans of the genitourinary system\nSuggested Readings\n Simoneaux SF, Greenbaum LA.

Epstein-Barr virus quantitative polymerase chain reaction from peripheral blood\nMore potent immunosuppression has led to dramatic improvements in kidney transplant success over the last\nfew decades. Early acute rejection rates have plummeted and 1-year and 3-year graft survival rates have\nincreased. However, these improvements have come at a price. Immune surveillance is a critical host defense\nmechanism against cancer. It is not surprising, therefore, that cancer development has become more prominent\nin transplant recipients, from both the more intense immune suppression and the greater longevity of allograft\nand patient survival, necessitating a longer burden of maintenance immunosuppression.\nIn the vignette, the boy exhibits many of the risk factors for development of a feared malignancy, post-\ntransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Risk factors include donor-recipient Epstein-Barr virus\nseromismatch (donor positive, recipient negative), young recipient age, use of induction immunosuppression,\nand increased intensity of maintenance immunosuppression with his recent rejection episode. Therefore, the\ndevelopment of low-grade fever and sudden weight loss, at this time point and with this setup, should\nimmediately raise suspicion of PTLD. In contrast, suspicion of acute rejection should be low in the presence of\na stable serum creatinine, so a kidney biopsy would not be the first choice test. Fungal infection, which the\ngalactomannan test would help diagnose, is not the most likely scenario here. The incidence of fungal infection\nis low after kidney transplant, generally occurs early, and should not be the first diagnosis with weight loss. A\nradionuclide renal scan would be used to diagnose poor blood flow such as in acute tubular necrosis or renal\nvessel thrombosis, neither of which is likely with a stable serum creatinine value. In absence of physical\nexamination findings, a peripheral blood Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the test\nthat would likely be performed by most transplant professionals as the next step. Note that an EBV PCR test\ndoes not show PTLD, so computed tomography with contrast of the abdomen (and ideally, chest also) should be\nperformed, but this option was not offered in the vignette choices. In contrast, a BK virus infection, diagnosed\nby a PCR test, would not explain the symptoms. BK virus nephropathy after renal transplant is typically\ncharacterized by a symptomless nephropathy and elevated serum creatinine.\nPost-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and other malignancies represent a significant cause of patient\ndeath (and therefore, also graft loss) in adults after kidney transplantation. The Table lists the malignancies that\nare relatively increased in adult kidney transplant recipients compared to the general population and Figure 1\nshows the magnitude of increase for some of these cancers.\nTable.

Pediatric Transplant 2013;17:707-709\nThe PTLD rates are low in adult kidney transplant recipients, occurring in less than 3% by 3 years post-\ntransplant. Rates show a bimodal distribution, with a first early peak in the first year (related to EBV primary\ninfection in the seronegative recipient) and then a second peak at 5 to 10 years post-transplant. Epstein-Barr\nvirus is an oncogenic virus that is intimately related to the malignant transformation of the host immune cells,\ntypically B cells, in PTLD. Risk factors for PTLD include EBV seromismatch or recipient seronegativity\n(approximately 5-fold increase), pediatric or elderly recipient age, recipient Caucasian race, induction-depleting\nantibody, or de novo sirolimus use (approximately 2-fold increase from each). The cumulative incidence of\nPTLD after kidney transplant showed a dramatic increase in the late 1990s and early 2000s (Figure 2),\nattributed to more potent overall immunosuppression, before a drop occurred as minimization strategies became\nmore common.\n\nReprinted with permission from Dharnidharka VR et al, Kidney Transplantation in Children. N Engl J Med\n2014;371:2014; 371:549--558\nIn children, PTLD is by far the most prominent malignancy, with other tumors occurring much more rarely. In\nadult recipients, skin cancer is the most frequent cancer.\nCancer diagnosis is usually by biopsy of the lesion and histopathological examination. A high index of\nsuspicion for malignancy in the appropriate setting allows for earlier detection on physical examination or\nimaging. In rare cases, the lesion may be inaccessible for biopsy, in which case, other tests provide strong\nsupportive evidence.\nPREP Pearls\n Malignancies are more prominent after kidney transplantation as immune surveillance mechanisms against\ncancer are also suppressed by the nonspecific extrinsic immunosuppression that we administer.\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the epidemiology, diagnosis, and associations of malignancy with renal transplantation\nSuggested Readings\n Dharnidharka VR, Fiorina P, Harmon WE.

The differential diagnosis of uric acid stones in children includes cysteine,\nxanthine, and hypoxanthine stones.\nThe pathogenesis of uric acid stones is quite complex and is attributed to acquired and inherited conditions. Uric\nacid stone formers are more likely to have 1 or more of 3 major urinary abnormalities that predispose to uric\nacid stone formation: low urine pH, low urine volume, and elevated urine uric acid. Therefore, the incidence of\nuric acid stones increases substantially in hot, arid climates due to the propensity to make low volume acidic\nurine that promotes the formation of uric acid stones (response choice B is correct).\nThe most important urine characteristic for uric acid stone formation is an acidic pH because uric acid is\ninsoluble in an acidic environment. At a pH of 5, most uric acid is in the insoluble undissociated form. At a\nurinary pH of 5.5 (the pKa of uric acid), half of uric acid is in its sparingly soluble undissociated form with the\nother half in the more soluble urate form. Uric acid solubility is around 600 mg/L when the urine pH is 6\n(Figure).\nReprinted with permission from Moe OW, Abate N, Sakhaee K. Pathophysiology of uric acid nephrolithiasis.\nEndocrinol Metab Clin North Am. 2002;31(4):895-914.\n\nThe implication is that, in order to excrete 1,200 mg uric acid at a urine pH of 6, one would need 2 L of urine.\nWith a urine pH of 7, most (95%) urinary uric acid is in the soluble form of urate (response choices A and D are\nincorrect as the uric acid is in the soluble form when urine pH is high).\nUric acid stones are more common among stone formers who are diabetic, obese, or have metabolic syndrome.\nOf note, hyperuricosuria is not always present among individuals with uric acid stones. The majority of uric\nacid stone formers have an overly acidic urine that in some might be attributed to a chronic diarrheal state,\nexcessive dietary animal protein intake, or strenuous exercise with insufficient hydration. The majority of uric\nacid stone formers have acid urine pH without an obvious cause and are said to have idiopathic uric acid stone\nformation. In this group, there may be increased net acid excretion and reduced buffering due to impaired\nammonium excretion (response choice C is incorrect as normal citrate reduces risk of stone formation by\nimproving ammonium excretion).\nOf note, some individuals with calcium oxalate stones have been shown to have greater uricosuria than those\nwith uric acid stones.\nA low urine volume contributing to a high urine uric acid concentration is the second most important factor in\nthe development of uric acid stones (response choice D is incorrect as the urine volume is normal).\nHyperuricosuria may predispose to uric acid stone formation but is found in the minority of uric acid stone\nformers. Uric acid is derived from endogenous and exogenous purine sources. Causes of hyperuricemia are\nshown in the Table.\nTable.

This complication can be prevented by adequate hydration (2 to 3 times\nmaintenance), alkalinization, allopurinol, and rasburicase therapy. Inborn errors of purine metabolism are rare\n\ncauses of urate stones. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (as exemplified in the vignette) is due to hypoxanthine-guanine\nphosphoribosyl transferase deficiency and is an X-linked disorder characterized by self mutilation,\nhyperuricemia with uric acid calculi, and choreoathetosis. Patients with type I glycogen storage disease\n(glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency) may develop uric acid stones in association with hyperuricosuria. In\naddition, Fanconi syndrome, intracranial disease, malignancies, and inflammation, among other causes, can lead\nto increased urate excretion in the urine. Increased uric acid production, via purine or urate overproduction, as\ncan be seen with (1) inherited enzyme defects; (2) clinical disorders; (3) drugs or toxins; and (4) diet, can lead\nto a predisposition for uric acid stone formation. Finally, the volume depletion and bicarbonate loss that occurs\nin children with chronic diarrhea increases the risk for uric acid nephrolithiasis.\nTo summarize, factors that are associated with promoting uric acid stone formation include urinary pH less than\n6, low urine volume, hyperuricosuria, hyperuricemia, and possibly hypocitraturia.\nPREP Pearls\n Uric acid is insoluble at a low pH.\n Uric acid stones are uncommon in children.\n There may be an underlying metabolic condition in children who present with uric acid stones.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the pathogenesis and biochemical features of uric acid nephrolithiasis\nSuggested Readings\n Kirejczyk JK, Korzeniecka-Kozerska A, Baran M, Porowska H, Porowski T, Wasilewska A.

    "explanation": "B. combined ClC-Ka and CIC-Kb gene defects\nThe transport mechanisms in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle are as follows: the Na-K-ATPase\npump in the basolateral (peritubular) membrane pumps sodium (Na) out of, and potassium (K) into, the cell.\nThis creates a low intracellular Na concentration, which drives many of the cell's reabsorptive processes. The\nentry of filtered sodium chloride (NaCl) into the cells is mediated by an electroneutral Na-K-2Cl (NKCC2)\ncotransporter (furosemide-sensitive) in the apical (luminal) membrane. The energy for this process is provided\nby the favorable inward electrochemical gradient for Na. The inward movement of K and Cl occurs against their\nelectrochemical gradients and is powered by the inward movement of Na into the cell. The reabsorbed Na\n(which has entered the cell) is pumped out by the Na-K-ATPase pump. The concentration of K in the filtrate\nand tubular fluid is much lower than that of Na and Cl, and much of the reabsorbed K recycles back into the\nlumen through K channels (ROMK) in the apical membrane to allow continued NaCl reabsorption. This\nmovement of cationic K into the lumen plus the flux of reabsorbed Cl out of the cell and into the peritubular\ncapillary (via Cl channels) causes the lumen to become more positively charged compared with the cell and\nperitubular space. This lumen electropositivity creates an electrical gradient that promotes the passive\nreabsorption of cations (sodium [Na], calcium [Ca], and magnesium [Mg]) via the paracellular pathway\nbetween the cells. The most important Cl channels in these cells are ClC-Kb; also present but not as critical are\nthe ClC-Ka channels. Each of these Cl channels requires interaction with a small protein called barttin to\nfunction normally. These chloride channels also play an important role in ion transport in the ear, accounting for\nthe association between some genetic renal transport defects and deafness.\nThe clinical features in patients with Bartter syndrome are primarily due to a defect in sodium chloride\nreabsorption in the medullary thick ascending limb (TAL) of the loop of Henle. This is usually likened to the\neffects seen with the chronic administration of furosemide. Mild volume depletion leads to secondary\nhyperaldosteronism; this, along with increased distal delivery of sodium, results in increased urinary potassium\nlosses and hydrogen ion secretion. Sodium chloride reabsorption without water reabsorption in TAL plays a\ncentral role in creating the medullary concentration gradient that is required for excretion of maximally\nconcentrated urine in the presence of antidiuretic hormone. The impaired concentrating ability and polyuria\nseen in Bartter syndrome is due to impaired sodium transport in the loop of Henle and the chronic hypokalemia,\nwhich can cause secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In addition, both calcium and magnesium are\npassively reabsorbed in the TAL down the electrochemical gradient created by sodium chloride transport. The\nnet effect is that urinary calcium excretion is normal or increased and the serum magnesium concentration may\nbe normal to low.\n\nDifferent types of Bartter syndrome can result from a defect in any of the genes that direct the synthesis or\nmembrane insertion of the transporters. The severity and clinical presentation of Bartter syndrome varies with\neach type:\n Defective function of the Na-K-2Cl (NKCC2, SLC12A1) cotransporter in the luminal membrane and the luminal\npotassium channel (ROMK, KCNJ1) are the causes of Bartter syndrome types I and II and are not associated with\ndeafness (response choices C and D are incorrect). Types I and II are usually severe disorders that cause\npolyhydramnios during pregnancy and prematurity. Patients who survive infancy develop hypokalemia,\nmetabolic alkalosis, polyuria, and hypercalciuria.\n Defects in the basolateral chloride channel (ClC-Kb, CLCNKB) causes Bartter syndrome type III. The classic form\nof Bartter syndrome, type III, is less severe and presents later in life with hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and\nhypercalciuria. The reduced severity of type III Bartter syndrome may be due to redundancy of chloride channels\nin the cells of the thick ascending limb. Although loss of ClC-Kb activity leads to disease, coexistent ClC-Ka\nactivity appears to ameliorate the process. Some patients with ClC-Kb mutations have one or more features of\nGitelman syndrome including hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria (not hypercalciuria).\n The barttin subunit is a critical component of both channels. Thus, a single defect that affects the barttin subunit\nreduces the function of both channels (type IV). Double mutations, which reduce the function of both ClC-Ka and\nClC-Kb, produce a phenotype similar to type IV generally called type IVb. Of note, defects that affect both the\nClC-Ka and ClC-Kb simultaneously cause Bartter syndrome associated with sensorineural deafness [IV and IVb]\n(response choice B is correct). Types IV and IVb cause severe disease generally with antenatal presentation and\nhearing loss. Patients have neurosensory deafness because the 2 chloride channels are critical for ion transport\nin the stria vascularis of the inner ear.\n Lastly, abnormalities that enhance the function of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) in the basolateral\nmembrane of the thick ascending limb can impair sodium chloride transport and generate a mild Bartter\nphenotype called type V. The major clinical manifestations of Bartter type V are hypocalcemia and\nhypomagnesemia.\nA Bartter-like phenotype (a phenotype resembling Bartter syndrome) can occur in other clinical settings, which\ninclude:\n Surreptitious abuse of diuretics (Pseudo-Bartter syndrome)\n Aminoglycosides because of tubular injury\n EAST syndrome (Epilepsy, severe Ataxia, moderate Sensorineural deafness, and Tubulopathy) leading to renal\nsalt wasting, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and a normal blood pressure\n Homozygous mutations in the KCNJ10 gene, which encodes for a potassium channel that is expressed in the\nkidney and brain\nPREP Pearls\n Bartter syndrome is associated with normal blood pressure.\n There may be a history of polyhydramnios\n Deafness is associated with type IV Bartter syndrome.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the pathophysiology of the various forms of Bartter syndrome\n\nSuggested Readings\n Amirlak I, Dawson KP.

    "explanation": "A. alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT)\nThis is a case of primary hyperoxaluria resulting in end-stage-renal disease (ESRD) in infancy.\nOxalosis or primary hyperoxaluria is a rare (estimated 1-3 cases per million population) autosomal recessive\ndisease that causes increased oxalate production. Oxalate is excreted by the kidney, and the excess oxalate\nproduction and excretion results in a spectrum of kidney disease from recurrent calcium oxalate stone formation\nto nephrocalcinosis and ESRD. Primary hyperoxaluria accounts for 1% to 2% of pediatric ESRD in the United\nStates. It may account for up to 10% of pediatric ESRD in North Africa and the Middle East due to areas where\nconsanguinity is common.\nThere are 3 forms of primary hyperoxaluria (Table, Figure 2):\n Type 1 is the most common and accounts for 80% of cases of primary hyperoxaluria. Type 1 is caused by\nmutations in AGXT, which encodes liver specific alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). AGT catalyzes the\nconversion of glycoxylate to glycine in the peroxisome.\n Type 2 is caused by mutations in GRHPR, which encodes glyoxylate reductase–hydroxypyruvate reductase\n(GRHPR). GRHPR catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylate to glycolate and hydroxypyruvate to D-glycerate in the\nmitochondria. Of note, GRHPR is expressed in all organs, but is thought to be highly expressed in hepatocytes.\n Loss-of-function mutations in either AGT or GRHPR result in accumulation of glycoxylate, which is converted by\nlactate dehydrogenase to oxalate.\n Type 3 is caused by mutations in HOGA, the gene encoding liver-specific mitochondrial enzyme 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-\nglutarate aldolase (HOGA). It is not yet known how this leads to increase oxalate.\nTable.

The excess calcium oxalate precipitates in the renal tubules, and\npatients often present with recurrent calcium oxalate stones. These patients will present with symptoms of\nstones, including abdominal or flank pain, hematuria, frequency, dysuria, and/or with signs/symptoms of\nsecondary pyelonephritis, such as fever and chills. In other cases, calcium oxalate deposition in both tubules and\nthe tubulointerstitium can lead to presentation with failure to thrive (FTT) and nephrocalcinosis. However, 20%\nto 50% of patients present with chronic renal failure. Patients may present with FTT, metabolic acidosis and\nrenal insufficiency or in more advanced cases with non-specific symptoms from uremia (eg, nausea, emesis,\nmalaise, fatigue) and/or decreased urine output. It is important not to miss this diagnosis in a case of unknown\nESRD, as oxalate deposition will recur in a renal transplant, as the source of the oxalate is the liver. Up to 10%\nof primary hyperoxaluria patients are diagnosed only after disease recurs after renal transplantation. For patients\nwith ESRD secondary to type 1 primary hyperoxaluria, a combined liver kidney transplant is often indicated.\nIn patients with impaired glomerular filtration (usually < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2), the excess oxalate production\ncombined with decreased ability for renal excretion induces systemic oxalosis, which can lead to additional\nsymptoms. Oxalate deposition occurs in the bone marrow and bone, joints, retina, myocardium, blood vessels,\nskin, and central nervous system. Bone marrow oxalosis leads to red blood cell aplasia and erythropoietin\nresistant anemia. Deposition in the bone can to advanced bone age and short stature, bone pain or fractures.\n\nOxalosis in the skin can lead to ulceration. Myocardial deposition can lead to arrhythmias and\ncardiomyopathies. Even post-liver and kidney transplant, excess body stores of oxalate take years to dissipate,\nand patients remain at risk of nephrolithiasis and oxalate deposition in the new kidney.\nThe patient in the vignette presents with bilateral diffuse cortical nephrocalcinosis (Figure 1 ).\nFigure1: Renal ultrasonography for the infant described in the critique.\nWhile primary hyperoxaluria can also present with medullary nephrocalcinosis, cortical nephrocalcinosis is\nstrongly suggestive of primary hyperoxaluria type 1. Cortical nephrocalcinosis is unlikely to be observed in\nother causes of infantile nephrocalcinosis such as distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), Bartter syndrome, or\nvitamin D toxicity, which more often present with medullary nephrocalcinosis.\nThere is a consensus algorithm for diagnosis of hyperoxaluria. The first step to assess urinary oxalate excretion.\nIn patients with a glomerular filtration rate greater than 40 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and in whom a 24-hour urine\ncan be obtained, hyperoxaluria should be suspected if urine oxalate is greater than 0.7 mmol/1.73 m2 per 24\nhours or 63 mg/day per 1.73m2. Many patients present in infancy, where 24-hour urine is not readily feasible.\nUrinary oxalate excretion varies by age, but there are age-specific normal values for oxalate:creatinine ratios\nthat can be used. If abnormal, a 24-hour urine collection (with catheterization, for example) for oxalate is\nindicated to confirm the diagnosis.\nPrimary hyperoxaluria needs to be distinguished from secondary hyperoxaluria, as may occur in the setting of\nmalabsorption or gastrointestinal disease. Prematurity is also a cause of increased oxalate excretion. Normal\nurinary oxalate excretion is less than 0.45 mmol/1.73 m2 per 24 hours. Typically, hyperoxaluria from high\noxalate and low calcium diet will lead to limited elevations of urinary oxalate excretion (between 0.46-0.6\n\nmmol/1.73 m2 per 24 hours). Enteric hyperoxaluria can be between 0.7 to 1 mmol/1.73 m2. Primary\nhyperoxaluria should be strongly suspected with urine oxalate greater than 1 mmol/1.73 m2. If urine oxalate is\nelevated greater than 0.7 mmol/1.73 m2 per 24 hours, examination of 24-hour urine for urine glycolate and L-\nglycerate should be performed. Twice normal elevations of urinary glycolate and L-glycerate are strongly\nsuggestive of primary hyperoxaluria. Typically, genetic testing is performed to confirm the diagnosis. The most\ncommon mutations are in AGXT, and sequencing of this gene is typically performed first, followed by\nsequencing of GRHPR and HOGA, respectively. However, this approach may be modified; for example, certain\nmutations are more common among specific ethnic groups (eg. GRHPR mutations in Northern Europeans and\nAsians). If these are not diagnostic, liver biopsy for measurement of AGT and GRHPR enzyme activity may be\nconsidered.\nFor patients with decreased glomerular filtration (GFR < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2), serum oxalate levels are used\nfor diagnosis. With GFR less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2, serum oxalate levels greater than 20 µmol/L are\ntypical. With more severe renal failure, such as GFR less than 20 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or with ESRD on\ndialysis, levels greater than 50 or greater than 80 mol/L, respectively, are suggestive of primary\nhyperoxaluria.\nTreatment of primary hyperoxaluria includes increased fluid intake, alkalinization of the urine and, in some\ncases of type 1 primary hyperoxaluria, pyridoxine supplementation. Pyridoxine is a cofactor for the AGT\nenzyme, and supplementation improves enzyme function and decreases oxalate production in greater than 50%\nof cases. Without treatment, type 1 and occasionally type 2 primary hyperoxaluria results in insidious\nprogression to ESRD, and these treatments slow progression. Type 3 primary hyperoxaluria appears to be a\nmilder form of disease and very rarely leads to ESRD or systemic oxalosis.\nThe case presented a child with kidney failure and cortical nephrocalcinosis. The most likely cause is primary\nhyperoxaluria type 1, caused by mutations in AGT. Mutations in B1-subunit of H+-ATPase (ATP6V1B1) cause\ntype 1 distal RTA with hearing loss. Mutations in the chloride channel gene, CLCNKB, cause Bartter syndrome\ntype III. As indicated, distal RTA Bartter syndrome is typically associated with medullary nephrocalcinosis and\nis unlikely to cause ESRD in infancy. Mutations in nephrin (NPHS1) cause congenital nephrotic syndrome,\nwhich is not associated with nephrocalcinosis, and is more likely to present with nephrotic syndrome than\nESRD. Mutations in SLC4A4, encoding NBCe1, are associated with proximal RTA and are unlikely to cause\nESRD or nephrocalcinosis.\nPREP Pearls\n Twenty percent to 50% of patients with primary hyperoxaluria can present with chronic kidney disease.\n Pyridoxine supplementation improves hyperoxaluria in some cases.\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Recognize the clinical features and natural history of oxalosis\nSuggested Readings\n Bergstralh EJ, Monico CG, Lieske JC, et al.

    "explanation": "D. vesicoureteral reflux\nThe patient in this vignette has multiple congenital anomalies; the renal ultrasonography reveals a large right-\nsided moiety and a smaller moiety joined at the lower pole, along with absent kidney in the left renal fossa. This\npicture is consistent with an ectopic kidney which is fused with the right kidney. This newborn has cross-fused\nectopia. This condition is associated with a higher incidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Though nephrotic\nsyndrome is seen with other syndromes, ectopic kidneys do not pose a higher risk. Tumors such as Wilms can\noccur more commonly in fusion abnormalities, but renal medullary cell carcinoma is not reported at a higher\nrisk. Nephrolithiasis can occur more often in ectopic kidneys due to infection or stasis, but a higher incidence of\nnephrocalcinosis is not reported with cross-fused ectopia.\nDuring embryological development, the metanephros ultimately differentiates into the mammalian adult kidney.\nThe initial position of the metanephric kidney is in the pelvis opposite the sacral somites. There is rapid caudal\ngrowth that leads to migration of the kidneys from pelvic to the retroperitoneal renal fossa. As it migrates, the\nrenal pelvis rotates through 90°, which directs the renal hilum medially. This migration is complete by 8 to 9\nweeks of gestation. Abnormalities of the migration pathway result in either an ectopic location of the kidney or\nfusion abnormalities.\nSimple ectopic kidneys\nThe most common ectopic location is the pelvis. It is usually unilateral. Incidence of ectopic kidneys is between\n1:1,000 to 1:5,000. The majority are asymptomatic and detected incidentally either by prenatal or postnatal\nultrasonography. However, they are prone to urinary infection, stone formation, and trauma. Moreover, there is\na higher incidence of ureteropelvic obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux in ectopic kidneys. In case series where\nthe function of the ectopic kidney was evaluated, the ectopic kidney was generally noted to have lower function.\nIn girls, ectopic kidneys are associated with genital anomalies such as agenesis of the uterus and vagina\n(Mayer–Rokitansky syndrome). Ectopic kidney can be associated with other nonrenal anomalies (adrenal,\ncardiac, and skeletal abnormalities) and is a clinical feature in syndromes such as CHARGE or VACTERL. If\ndetected prenatally, ectopic kidneys should be confirmed by postnatal renal ultrasonography. Since VUR has\nbeen detected in 20% of ectopic kidneys, voiding cystourethrogram is recommended in the evaluation of ectopic\nkidneys. If hydronephrosis is detected by the renal ultrasonography, evaluation for obstruction (MAG3) or\ndifferential function (DMSA) is performed. Further management of ectopic kidneys are guided by the findings\nof these diagnostic studies.\nFusion abnormalities:\n\n Horseshoe kidney (HSK): Abnormal migration of both kidneys with fusion occurring before complete ascent\nleads to HSK. This fusion can occur between 4 to 9 weeks of gestation. The 2 moieties are fused by either\nparenchyma (before fifth gestational week) or fibrous isthmus. The horseshoe kidney is located either in pelvis\nor lower lumbar area, as further ascent is prevented by the junction of inferior mesenteric artery and aorta.\nSince there is abnormal rotation of the kidneys, it results in the renal pelvis lying anteriorly; also, horseshoe\nkidneys have variable blood supply from iliac, aorta, hypogastric, or middle sacral arteries. Incidence from birth\ndefect registries is 0.4 to 1.6 per 10,000 live births. The majority are asymptomatic. However, VUR is more\nprevalent in horseshoe kidneys and has been reported in 24% to 26%, while ureteropelvic junction obstruction\nhas been reported in 13% to 35% of patients with HSK. Renal calculi are seen in about 20% of cases and likely a\nresult of obstruction and infection. Horseshoe kidney is seen in some syndromes such as Turner syndrome, and\ntrisomy 13, 18, and 21. Increased risk of renal tumors has been reported in HSK. Horseshoe kidney was present\nin 0.49% of the patients with Wilms tumor registered in the National Wilms Tumor Study. This suggests that\nWilms tumor is, at most, twice more common in patients with HSK than in the general population. In adults,\nrenal cell and transitional cell carcinoma has been reported in association with HSK. Management principles are\nthe same as outlined for ectopic kidney.\n Cross-fused ectopia: Crossed ectopia happens when one kidney crosses the midline. In cross-fused ectopia, the\nkidney crosses the midline and fuses with the contralateral kidney. In both situations, the ureter retains the\nnormal insertion. Mechanism of occurrence is thought to be either because of ureteric bud crossing the midline\nand inducing a second kidney on that side or during ascent upper pole becomes fused to lower pole of the\nleading kidney and drags it across the midline. The fused portion is often attached at the inferior pole of the\nnoncrossed kidney. The reported incidence is 1:2,000. Genital abnormalities and other urinary abnormalities\nsuch as VUR, obstruction, and stones are higher in this condition.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the diagnosis and management of ectopic and horseshoe kidneys\nSuggested Readings\n Cascio S, Sweeney B, Granata C, Piaggio G, Jasonni V, Puri P.

He had been well until about 3 weeks ago when he had an upper respiratory infection with 2 days of\nfever and sore throat, but this resolved without treatment.

    "explanation": "B. bumetanide\nEdema refers to the clinical condition in which an excessive amount of fluid accumulates in the extravascular\ninterstitial space of the body. The balance of competing Starling forces (hydrostatic and oncotic pressure)\nbetween plasma and the interstitium normally favors a small net movement of fluid from the capillary lumen\ninto the interstitial space. This fluid is then collected by the lymphatic system and returned to the venous\nsystem via the thoracic duct. Edema occurs when these different forces become imbalanced either from\nalterations to capillary hemodynamics (change in hydrostatic or oncotic pressure gradients across the capillary\nwall), an increase in capillary wall permeability, or impaired lymphatic function.\nIn this vignette, the young boy has swelling, hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, and a moderately elevated\ncreatinine noted from the day before his acute presentation to the emergency room. Therefore, he appears to\nhave all of the hallmark findings of glomerulonephritis (GN). With glomerulonephritides (GNs), there is a\nprecipitating event, typically an immunologic exposure, but also may occur with aberrations to glomerular\nstructural components (eg, hereditary nephritis), which results in glomerular inflammation. Activation of\ndifferent inflammatory mediators (cytokines, coagulation factors, complement cascade) can cause varying\ndegrees of response and proliferation of the resident cells of the glomeruli.\nMild responses may cause only mesangioproliferative changes, as seen in lesions of class II lupus or\nimmunoglobulin A nephropathy. More severe reactions can cause mesangial hypercellularity, endothelial\nproliferation, and leukocyte infiltration into the glomeruli. With these more severe reactions, there may be\ndistortion of the capillary lumens within the glomeruli and impairment of microcirculation, leading to\ncompromise of glomerular blood flow and filtration, and the overall retention of salt and water. This excess of\nsodium and fluid, in turn, leads to an increase in intravascular hydrostatic pressure (volume overload) and\nedema.\nTherefore, the best ways to treat the edema in GN are to appropriately treat the primary disorder, if possible,\nand to ameliorate salt and fluid retention. Restricting sodium and fluid intake through dietary restriction helps\nlimit further worsening of edema. However, increasing the excretion of sodium and fluid through the use of\ndiuretics would directly address the edema seen with GN. If diuretic therapy is ineffective and there is the\npotential of serious morbidity from continued edema, then fluid removal by ultrafiltration or sodium and fluid\nremoval by dialysis needs to be considered.\nLoop diuretics have the greatest diuretic effect, which also makes them more likely to cause electrolyte\nabnormalities such as hypokalemia or hypochloremia. Also, because they act most proximally, resistance to\ntheir effect may develop in a few days so that more distally acting diuretics may need to be added to maintain\nany diuresis. Thiazide diuretics are often effective, but have limited efficacy when the glomerular filtration rate\n(GFR) is less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Potassium-sparing diuretics, like spironolactone and amiloride, are\n\noften effective as a second-line therapy, especially in patients that are hypokalemic. In the vignette, in a patient\nwith potentially compromised GFR and significant fluid overload, the use of a loop diuretic such as bumetanide\nwould be extremely appropriate to address the edema.\nFirst-line treatment of the common GNs associated with hypocomplementemia (postinfectious,\nmembranoproliferative, and lupus), like in this vignette, may vary both in effectiveness and acuity.\nCorticosteroid therapy may be considered as initial therapy for lupus and membranoproliferative GN, though\nthe responsiveness is unlikely to occur in the acute period in membranoproliferative GN. Corticosteroids are not\nconsidered efficacious with postinfectious GN. In the vignette, the young boy with a low C3 and normal C4\nfollowing an acute illness weeks ago likely has postinfectious GN, is less likely to have membranoproliferative\nGN, and is extremely unlikely to have lupus GN. Therefore, methylprednisolone is less appropriate to acutely\ntreat the edema in this scenario.\nHypoalbuminemia, or hypoproteinemia, can also cause edema through the associated decrease in intravascular\noncotic pressure, but this is often not clinically detectable until the serum albumin level is generally less than\n2.5 g/dL. With low intravascular oncotic pressure and the loss of intravascular fluid into the interstitium,\nindividuals with significant hypoalbuminemia may also have signs of intravascular hypovolemia, such as\ntachycardia, hypotension, and compromised organ perfusion. Treatment of the edema, as well as the\nhypovolemia, is best done with infusion of colloids, like albumin, to raise the intravascular oncotic pressure and\ndraw fluid out of the interstitium back into the vascular space. In the vignette, the patient’s serum albumin level\nis not significantly low while his blood pressure is moderately elevated, so he does not appear to have\ncompromise of his intravascular volume (or oncotic pressure). Therefore, albumin would not be the best\ntreatment for his edema and, in fact, may worsen his blood pressure and respiratory status.\nThe use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor may cause benefit in helping to control\nhypertension while also decreasing proteinuria. This decrease in proteinuria may eventually lead to an increase\nin plasma albumin levels and oncotic pressure. However, like described previously, the primary cause of edema\nin glomerulonephritis is an elevated plasma hydrostatic pressure and NOT a low plasma oncotic pressure, so the\nACE inhibitor effect on proteinuria will have negligible effect on edema. Additionally, the efferent arteriolar\nvasodilation caused by ACE inhibition will cause a decrease in GFR and a drop in fluid and sodium excretion.\nTherefore, enalaprilat would not be an appropriate choice and in fact could worsen the edema.\nCalcium-channel blockers are used fairly often to treat the hypertension seen with GN, mainly because they\ncause vasodilation with little other adverse effects. However, dihydropyridines, like nifedipine, are more\ncommonly associated with causing peripheral edema as an adverse effect. This swelling, like that of other\nvasodilators, is caused by local capillary hypertension, allowing for fluid to be held in the interstitium. This\nswelling is dose-dependent and often is not as effectively treated by the use of diuretics. In fact, ACE inhibitors\n\nare often more effective in treating this peripheral edema. Because of this known adverse effect risk and the\nlack of efficacy against the causes of edema in GN, nifedipine is not an appropriate selection.\nPREP Pearls\n The edema seen in glomerulonephritis is secondary to elevated capillary hydrostatic pressure from the excess\nrenal retention of sodium and fluid.\n Diuretics are a first-line therapy for both the edema and hypertension seen in glomerulonephritis. Loop diuretics\nshould be a primary consideration as they are still effective when glomerular filtration is moderately to severely\nimpaired and they do not have the risk of causing hyperkalemia.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Plan the treatment of edema in glomerulonephritis\nSuggested Readings\n Nachman PH, Jennette JC, Falk RJ.

      "ureteral obstruction Answer D A common complication of incomplete fragmentation of a treated kidney stone is ureteral obstruction. In fact, the piling up of stone fragments in the ureter after lithotripsy has its own medical term: steinstrasse or stone street. Obstruction has a reported baseline incidence of approximately 2.1% after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of a single stone smaller than 2 cm in diameter but is much higher in larger stones. Similarly, the incidence of steinstrasse has ranged from 1% to 4% in all patients but increases to 5% to 10% when the stone diameter exceeds 2 cm. The placement of a ureteral stent remains somewhat controversial as a universal means of preventing complications, such as obstruction, especially for small- to medium-sized stones, but it may be indicated when treating patients whose stone burden exceeds a certain threshold. The patient described in the vignette has several risk factors for incomplete fragmentation of her stone: prior history of stones composed of a denser material (calcium oxalate monohydrate), lower pole location, and diameter greater than 2 cm, such that ureteral obstruction is of a much higher risk. ESWL was first used to treat urolithiasis in adults in the early 1980s as a less invasive alternative to surgery for symptomatic kidney stones. After its successful use in adults, ESWL was soon used in children, with the first published report of its effective use in children in 1986. These early reports focused on the effectiveness of the therapy in addressing the stones and the immediate complications, with little known about its long-term effects. During the past 30 years, there have been some reports of unanticipated long-term adverse effects of the therapy, but follow-up studies often have not substantiated these risks. Although it remains the least invasive and one of the most popular interventions for urolithiasis, ESWL is not without any risk and should only be used in patients who are symptomatic and in situations in which it is deemed the most appropriate therapy. One of the most common adverse effects seen after ESWL therapy is gross hematuria. This was first thought to be secondary to urothelial irritation from the stone fragments created by the shock waves (SWs) and was considered a good omen that the stone was successfully targeted. However, further investigation has revealed that the hematuria is more likely a consequence of parenchymal injury from the SWs. Blood loss from the procedure is often minimal because the hematuria often resolves after 24 to 48 hours, but the extent of underlying tissue injury often is underappreciated because it may not be obvious on ultrasonography. Studies of ESWL recipients who have systematically undergone computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging shortly after the procedure have had hematoma rates as high as 25%, much greater than the rate of less than 1% reported using ultrasonography. The reason for this injury is based on how ESWL works to pulverize stones. Two physical processes take place with SW treatment: direct stress and cavitation. The compressive SWs travel through the stone, amplified by the irregularities of the stone surface, to create internal stresses within the stone while also squeezing the stone from the outside. These stresses, occurring both internally and externally, aid in fragmenting the stone and are often more effective when the focal width of the SWs (ie, the targeted width of the lithotripser) is wider than the stone size. However, with widening the focal area of the SWs, there is a greater risk of injuring surrounding tissue. Cavitation is the formation of bubbles in the urine surrounding the stone by the negative pressure of the SWs, which in turn collapse and erode the outer surface of the stone. This process may be more easily thought about in regard to submarines because cavitation bubbles often make a loud popping noise on the outer walls of these vessels as they come to the surface. From in vitro studies, it is thought that cavitation likely plays a major role in tissue injury, but it does not occur in blood vessels or other tissues under normal conditions because particulate matter is often needed to be a nidus for bubble formation. Therefore, it is thought that direct stress from SWs may be the initial cause of vascular injury in the kidney, with particulate matter generated, and subsequent cavitation injury then takes place. Factors that limit the amount of surrounding parenchymal injury in animal studies are the number of SWs delivered and the level of energy delivered with the SWs, naturally, but also possibly the size of the kidney, with smaller animal kidneys having a greater risk of injury. Subsequently, ESWL therapy has evolved from its earliest use with modifications made to limit this potential for injury in patients yet still remaining effective in pulverizing the targeted stone. Slowing the rate of delivery of SWs has a significant protective effect on the kidneys while still proving therapeutically effective. In addition, delivery of lower-power SWs initially during a treatment followed by higher-power SWs later is as effective as using higher power throughout a treatment. An increased susceptibility to injury of smaller (ie, younger) kidneys has not been borne out in the clinical literature because some adult studies found older patients to be more susceptible, but this may be more from the natural tendency to be more protective in exposing pediatric patients to novel therapies. The evolution of ESWL therapy and its potential for harm are somewhat correlated with the risk of parenchymal injury in clinical studies. New renal scarring on technetium Tc 99m scan was found in patients 1 month after ESWL treatment, with distribution in the area of SW focus, in one early study. An initial prospective study of 18 patients undergoing ESWL found that one-quarter of patients had more than a 10% reduction in renal plasma flow at 18 and 48 months after the procedure. However, later studies have failed to confirm a reduction in renal plasma flow or renal function after ESWL, which has been thought to be secondary to improvements in ESWL technique. A prospective study of 100 consecutive adult ESWL recipients found that those patients with unobstructed kidneys after the procedure had no change in their glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 1 week but an actual increase in GFR after 3 months. The 16 patients with an obstructed kidney had a decrease in GFR to that kidney, but not the contralateral kidney, at 1 week, but this returned to baseline after 3 months, once the obstruction was addressed. Similarly, a study of patients with solitary kidney who received ESWL therapy did not have a decrease in GFR after treatment. Many studies in children receiving ESWL therapy have all failed to show any decrease in GFR, formation of scars, or decrease in renal growth. Therefore, contrary to early concerns, ESWL does not seem to be associated with causing decreased GFR in adults, and especially in children, so chronic kidney disease is not likely. Just as injury to the renal vessels can allow blood to leak into the urine, microscopic hemorrhage can also allow passage of bacteria from the urinary lumen side into the blood. The development of bacteremia after ESWL therapy is extremely low, reported at less than 1%, but is considerably higher with staghorn calculi, with the presence of a positive urine culture result, or if upper tract obstruction is already present. The use of antibiotics has been examined to prevent any infectious complications of ESWL therapy but is not effective in preventing complications in patients without either preexisting urinary tract infection (UTI) or infected stones. Screening with a urine culture at the time of SW therapy is generally recommended, and antibiotics should be considered in patients with a positive culture or a history of recurrent UTI and those with staghorn calculi or a history of struvite stones. In a patient without a prior history of UTI or struvite stones, as in the vignette, an infectious complication would be very unlikely, although a screening urine culture at the time of therapy would be indicated. Similar to the kidneys, there is also potential risk of injury by SWs to tissue surrounding the kidney. There have been case reports of ESWL-associated injuries, such as gastroduodenal erosions, hepatic hematoma, splenic rupture, pneumothorax, and colonic perforation, in the literature, but many of these reports are from early uses of ESWL. However, blood vessel injury remains a risk, and ESWL is contraindicated in individuals with abdominal aortic or renal artery aneurysms, as well as those with uncontrolled alterations in coagulation. Other contraindications include pregnancy and severe skeletal abnormalities. Another extrarenal organ of particular interest for injury risk from ESWL is the pancreas. There have been case reports of symptomatic pancreatitis after treatment. One study of ESWL recipients found transient increases in serum amylase and lipase levels in patients with proximal ureteral or kidney stones that was not seen in patients with more distal stones who were all treated similarly. Traction regarding this concern for pancreatic injury from ESWL was gained after a retrospective case-control study of early treatment recipients from the Mayo Clinic was published. Retrospective studies of large numbers of patients have not found any association with the use of ESWL and the development of diabetes mellitus; whether that is because of modifications in the therapy from its earlier use or because the causal association never existed is not clear. However, there does not appear to be any increased risk of diabetes development with ESWL use. A counterbalance to the risk of tissue injury from too great a dose of SWs is the risk of incomplete stone fragmentation from too little a dose. Large stone fragments may cause significant pain when being passed, whereas unloosed fragments that remain in place may act as a focus for future stone development. Factors that have been found to affect the likelihood of incomplete fragmentation include the number of stones and their size (more like total volume of stone being treated), their location, and their composition. Stones larger than 2 cm are less likely to be completely cleared by a single ESWL treatment and are more likely to have an associated complication, such as obstruction or severe flank pain. Similarly, ESWL treatment of multiple stones during one treatment is more likely to result in complications, so some may not consider its use (and opt for surgery) if more than 2 stones are being treated. Stones located in the lower pole of the kidney are significantly less likely to be fully fragmented compared with those in the upper and middle pole (29% vs >70%), whereas proximal ureteral stones are more easily treated than those more distal (82% vs 74%). Stones composed of calcium phosphate (ie, brushite), calcium oxalate monohydrate, and cystine are much denser and are associated with a higher risk of complications from fragment formation. PREP Pearls  The most common complications of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy are gross hematuria, pain, and obstruction.  Gross hematuria after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is related to renal parenchymal injury.  Rarer complications include urinary tract infections and extrarenal tissue injuries.

      "the majority of infants with neonatal hypertension are able to be weaned off antihypertensive medications by the first year of life Answer D Two percent to 3% of neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit will have hypertension (HTN), and overall, the incidence of neonatal hypertension is 0.2% to 3%. The etiology of hypertension in this this age group is most commonly secondary to: renovascular lesions including those related to umbilical artery catheters; renal parenchymal lesions such as polycystic kidney disease; cardiovascular lesions such as coarctation of the aorta and related to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; and chronic lung disease. The prognosis of infants with hypertension is overall very good, but is linked to the underlying etiology of HTN. In general, a majority of such children are weaned off from antihypertensive medications by 6 to 12 months of life. Infants with hypertension related to an umbilical artery catheter, as in this vignette, often only require antihypertensive medications for a few weeks or months as their hypertension usually resolves over time. This makes response choice D the best response. These children have a relatively good prognosis, but do have an increased risk for chronic kidney disease (abnormal renal function, renal atrophy, persistent HTN) and coarctation of abdominal aorta due to scarring and aneurysmal dilatation. Children with hypertension due to intrinsic renal disease, such as polycystic kidney disease, or due to renal vascular lesions such as renal vein thrombosis, have an increased risk for the development of hypertension over time and can experience worsening blood pressure elevations. Children with renal vein thrombosis in particular may ultimately require nephrectomy for the definitive treatment of their hypertension. Prematurity is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Nephrogenesis is not complete until the 34th to 36th week of gestation. Children born before this time are at risk for reduced nephron endowment as nephrogenesis is suboptimal after birth and is often complicated by multiple insults such as hypoperfusion and exposure to nephrotoxic medications. Specifically, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be avoided for the treatment of hypertension in premature infants during the neonatal period. Some studies suggest there may be accelerated and premature cessation of nephrogenesis in premature infants. Hoy et al was able to demonstrate reduced nephron mass and glomerular hypertrophy among individuals with lower birth weight (which can be considered as a proxy for estimated gestational age) and these findings corresponded to those who were hypertensive. Individuals born before 32 weeks of gestation have also been shown to have a greater prevalence of both pre-hypertension (approximately 40%) and hypertension (approximately 10%) when compared to age-matched individuals. Prematurity is also a risk factor for the development childhood/adolescent hypertension. As the child in the vignette was born at 34 weeks of gestation, it is possible that he has had near- normal/normal glomerulogenesis. Further, the etiology of his hypertension, secondary to umbilical artery catheterization, is associated with ultimate resolution in most cases. This makes response choice B not the preferred response. Finally, as described previously, most infants with hypertension have a very good prognosis with the majority of them able to be weaned from medication by 6 to 12 months of life. This makes response choice C incorrect.

      "increased maternal gut calcium absorption",
      "production of fetal calcitriol",
      "production of maternal calcitriol",
      "production of maternal parathyroid hormone Answer A Vitamin D is central to absorption of calcium and phosphorus. Vitamin D is either synthesized in the skin or obtained from the diet. It is then converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D by the liver or stored in adipose tissue. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D has a half-life of 14 to 20 days and is useful as a measure of vitamin D sufficiency. However, it has no biological activity until it is converted to 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) by 1α-hydroxylase in the kidney. Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin D, exerting its genomic effect by acting through the vitamin D receptor; without this active form intestines do not absorb calcium and phosphorus well, which leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism causing bone resorption and undermineralized new bone (rickets and osteomalacia). A third enzyme, 25-hydroxyvitamin D–24α-hydroxylase, converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or 1,25,24-dihydroxyvitamin D, which excretes these metabolites in the urine. Role of Vitamin D During Maturation During pregnancy, women supply the calcium and phosphorus needed for the fetus. Although it would appear that calcitriol is important for this process, several adaptations happen during pregnancy that provide the calcium and phosphorus independent of calcitriol. Maternal Adaptation The main adaptation that happens is a marked increase in the gut absorption of calcium and phosphorus, which starts at approximately 12 weeks of gestation. In fact, this increase starts much before an increase in maternal calcitriol levels, which is often observed in the third trimester. This increased calcium absorption has been observed even in vitamin D null mice and in severe vitamin- deficient rats. A similar phenomenon has also been seen in 1α-hydroxylase null pigs. This increase in maternal gut absorption is mediated by prolactin, placental lactogen, estradiol, and other factors. Other changes observed in the mother are increased bone turnover and increased renal calcium excretion. Fetal Adaptation 25-Hydroxyvitamin D freely crosses the placenta, whereas 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D does not readily cross the placenta. Vitamin D receptors are expressed in embryonic mesenchyme, which is the precursor of bone tissue, and in the placenta. 1α-Hydroxylase is also expressed widely in many cells, including placental trophoblasts. However, calcitriol is not needed for fetal skeletal growth as seen in vitamin D receptor null mice and vitamin D–deficient rats in which skeletal growth in not impaired and fetal blood calcium and phosphorus are normal. The key factor maintaining fetal calcium levels seems to be a calcium pump located in the fetal chorion. This pump causes placental transfer of calcium to the fetus such that the fetus remains hypercalcemic when compared with the mother. This is attributed to the effects of parathyroid hormone–related polypeptide and parathyroid hormone produced by the fetus. Fetal calcitriol levels and fetal parathyroid hormone levels are low. The calcitonin levels are higher than in the mother, which may aid in fetal bone accretion. Neonatal Changes Serum calcium levels decrease in the first 24 hours. However, in the early neonatal period, both term and preterm infants absorb calcium independent of calcitriol levels, passively facilitated through lactose. Only when the infants mature does this calcium absorption become a calcitriol-dependent process. Therefore, maternal vitamin D deficiency does not put the infant at risk for fetal calcium accretion but puts the infant at risk for developing vitamin D deficiency, which manifests later as rickets. PREP Pearls  Calcitriol, the active metabolite of vitamin D, plays a critical role in regulating calcium and bone metabolism.  Adaptations during pregnancy and fetal development provide calcium balance without requiring calcitriol.  Calcitriol becomes important for skeletal metabolism sometime after birth.

      "leukopenia",
      "transient development of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder",
      "use of whole blood vs plasma for the assay Answer D The patient described in the vignette has a high-risk situation for primary infection through the allograft itself by virtue of being donor positive and recipient negative. First detectable replication typically occurs in such situations between months 2 through 6 after transplant. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) would be less likely in an asymptomatic patient at low loads and with a negative plasma load at the subsequent testing at the transplant center. PTLD is also unlikely to be transient. An acute rejection is unlikely related to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) load, unless the rejection had been treated with more intensified immunosuppression. A community-acquired EBV infection is possible but less likely to disappear in a week. The variation in the source of EBV DNA is by far the more likely explanation. With the use of more potent and nonspecific extrinsic immunosuppression agents, the results of solid organ transplant have improved in the past several decades. However, such agents have also been associated with the emergence of complications from opportunistic microbial agent infection. In pediatric kidney transplant, opportunistic infections from herpesviruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV, or polyoma viruses (eg, BK virus), represent major complications, with detrimental effects on patient or allograft survival. Once these viral infections are established, treatments for BK virus nephropathy or EBV-associated PTLD remain suboptimal. Development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology in body fluid compartments with fairly rapid turnaround allows the use of serial nucleic acid testing for opportunistic viruses. These technologies have opened up a new avenue for prevention of these infections by preemptive monitoring at early stages of viral replication before the development of symptoms or tissue invasive disease. Lending support to such a hypothesis is the fact that, across groups, viral loads tend to be higher in established disease states or higher stages of disease vs subclinical states. However, transplant professionals must understand the intricacies behind these tests to properly interpret test results and make sound management decisions. For CMV loads, interpretation and intervention are relatively easier than for EBV and BK virus. Most centers practice chemoprophylaxis, which is effective in the prevention of invasive disease. Monitoring only without prophylaxis is practiced by a few centers. In this group, any viremia is used as a trigger point. CMV viremia directly correlates with invasive disease with little time gap. An international standard for CMV was created, now used in most laboratories. Each center’s laboratory should be able to provide a conversion from copies per milliliter to international units per milliliter. The results among different laboratories are generally comparable. Adequate treatment options are available so immunosuppression can be maintained. For EBV, the interpretation is unfortunately more complicated. First, these PCR techniques detect viral nucleic acids based on primers chosen for the assay. Different assays can have different primers, especially because many PCR assays have been locally developed by each center’s laboratory. EBNA1 is the gene target in all commercial EBV assays, but the amplicons vary among the commercial assays. Second, viral nucleic acids are present within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in the fluid fraction of blood. Because the assay detects both intracellular and extracellular free DNA, any of 3 blood compartments (PBMCs, whole blood, or plasma) can be used for the assay. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma in immunocompetent patients, episomal or naked EBV (cell-free) DNA derived from apoptotic cells passes into the peripheral blood. Some latently EBV-infected tumor cells may also leak into the bloodstream. In this condition, EBV load in the serum or plasma (not PBMCs) correlates with response and prognosis. In the posttransplant situation, PBMC and whole blood EBV viral loads have a fair correlation to each other, whereas plasma loads do not correlate with either of the other 2 compartments. Most notably, whole blood or PBMC loads tend to run much higher than plasma (ie, greater sensitivity but lower specificity in whole blood than plasma in terms of PTLD prediction). Centers that monitor whole blood will often see frequent low-level positivity. Collectively, all these points mean that it is NOT always possible to compare PCR results from one laboratory to another, especially if the source of DNA is different. Preiksaitis et al confirmed a high 2- to 3-log-fold variability in EBV PCR when a standard sample was sent to multiple laboratories. A World Health Organization international standard for EBV nucleic acid testing was then developed: a whole virus preparation of the EBV B95-8 strain type 1 assigned a concentration of 5 × 106 IU when reconstituted in 1 mL of nuclease-free water (http://www.nibsc.org/documents/ifu/09-260.pdf). However, Rychert et al found that some variability in assay results still persist. At this time, guidelines state that no recommendations can be currently made about the type of sample preferred. Most centers have to work with whatever type of sample their laboratory has contracted to use. No one specific EBV load has a high enough predictive value for PTLD development or to predict when to intervene. Gartner et al reviewed the literature and found that both the cutoff values and the units differ, depending on the study, with copies per milliliter being most common, followed by copies per 106 of PBMCs, and rarely copies per microgram of DNA. The cutoff also seems to vary based on the population being studied, the organ that was transplanted, and the assay used to measure the load. Further muddling the picture is that in children, a chronic high-load carrier state may exist, with differing implications, depending on the organ transplanted. At this time, recommendations are to monitor for increasing EBV viral loads, especially log-fold increases, when the serial tests have been performed by the same assay at the same laboratory. For BK virus, interventions are recommended in guidelines at blood levels greater than 10,000 copies/mL, although many of the same assay gene target and standardization issues exist for BK virus as they do for EBV. Some recent reports have therefore challenged the cutoff of 10,000 copies/mL. PREP Pearls  Peripheral blood viral load monitoring by polymerase chain reaction offers an opportunity for early intervention.  The polymerase chain reaction assays for many viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus and BK virus, are not standardized  Comparing one result to another requires knowledge of the intricacies of the testing method.  No one cutoff exists for Epstein-Barr virus viral loads for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder prediction.

    "options": [
      "χ2 test",
      "1-way analysis of variance",
      "survival analysis",
      "t test Answer C This research design is looking at a time to event occurrence (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] IgG conversion). The preferred statistical approach is a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. In this analysis, each patient has 3 characteristics: assigned study group (short-term or long-term antiviral treatment), time of observation, and status at the end of observation (event occurrence, censored [eg, dropout]). The results can graphically be displayed as shown in Figure 1. The survival analysis curve in Figure 1 shows survival as a stepwise function because survival is not a continuous outcome (events happen discretely). The size of the steps in the curve can often help depict the number of patients. In addition, some survival analysis curves list the number of patients remaining at the end of an observation period. This information is usually listed below the time on the x-axis, which is especially helpful when few patients make it to the end of the final observation period. It is important that the censored patients (especially dropouts) are depicted or described. In Figure 1 it is not possible to tell how many patients dropped out (censored). There are different types of censoring. Those that have no event at the end of observation or who drop out (death, other event occurrence, or ending participation) without an event are said to be right censored. Those who enroll in a study group but who have an event at an unknown time before the first observation are said to be left censored (patients who are IgG negative at evaluation and are randomized at the time of transplant but have already converted at the first observation after transplant would be left censored). Interval censoring occurs if the event occurs between 2 successive ascertainments. In this example, IgG conversions would be expected to occur between successive laboratory samplings, and procedures for interval censoring would be needed. In Figure 2, the IgG level is checked every 2 months, and so a positive conversion at the 4-month check (as shown for interval censoring) occurred between 2 and 4 months and would need to be assigned a time (likely either 4 months or the midpoint between observations, 3 months). For some events (eg, death), the time is typically known precisely. Kaplan-Meier survival curves can be statistically compared. A log-rank test is commonly performed. At each observation time point, a χ2 test is performed for each group, and the log-rank test sums the results. Thus, in our example, the log-rank test can determine whether there is a statistical difference between short-term and long-term antiviral therapy. Another way to analyze the survival curve would be the hazard ratio, which describes relative risk of events. The hazard ratio is for the full survival curve. In our example, it would be the relative hazard of EBV conversion (short-term vs long-term antiviral therapy) for the period of the study. A more visual approach to quantify the differences between survival curves is to plot the confidence interval at each observation point. The χ2 is appropriate to use for nominal data. In the example provided, this would be EBV conversion or no EBV conversion. In our example, if all patients were observed for 2 years after transplant a χ2 analysis could be performed on the rate of EBV conversion with short-term vs long-term antiviral therapy but would be unable to answer the fundamental question of whether there is a difference in the time to EBV IgG conversion. In addition, χ2 analysis does not allow censoring for dropouts. The χ2 test would be used as part of the log-rank test or hazard ratio mentioned above to analyze the results of the survival analysis. The t test is used to compare the mean in one group with the mean in another group and uses continuous data. In our example, if all the patients were observed for 2 years after transplant and all converted during the observation, the mean time to EBV IgG conversion with short-term vs long-term antiviral therapy could be compared using the t test if no censoring was required (all patients converted in study timeframe, no dropouts, etc). Similarly, 1-way analysis of variance could deal with continuous data (such as time to EBV IgG conversion) but does not allow censoring and would not be suitable if anyone dropped out or did not convert. PREP Pearls  Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is a great way to visually depict outcomes over time.  Additional analysis beyond the survival curve is required to determine whether a statistical difference is present.  It is important to note the number of patients remaining at each observation period, especially to the right. Large visual differences with small patient numbers often occur at the end of the observation.

      "peritoneal equilibration test Answer A In the vignette, the patient has presented with poor dialysate flow. The most likely cause is constipation, although catheter kinking or migration could result in the same scenario. The abdominal radiograph (KUB) films would help to decipher the position of catheter and indicate constipation. The peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluid is clear and the patient exam does not reveal any tenderness. Therefore, PD cell culture or a triglyceride level would not be warranted in this situation. While membrane failure can start with poor dialysate outflow, it is seen after longer durations of PD and does not develop abruptly. Therefore, peritoneal equilibration test would not be the right choice for this vignette. Peritoneal dialysis is the most common method of maintenance dialysis performed worldwide for management of end-stage renal disease in children. Though infectious complications such as peritonitis remains one of the most common complications of PD and causes severe morbidity in such patients, noninfectious complications also occur in about one-quarter of patients receiving PD. Mechanical complications include poor catheter drainage, leakage, hernia, catheter migration, hemoperitoneum, chyloperitoneum, or membrane failure. In a recent article, Kim et al summarized the complications that have been reported in the literature, as shown in the Table. Poor catheter drainage is one of the most common mechanical complications observed with PD in children. It occurs at a frequency of 5% to 25% in various case series. It is usually caused by constipation, catheter migration, occlusion (either internal such as fibrin or external such as omental wrapping), or catheter kinking. The majority of these patients improve following conservative measures such as treatment of constipation or catheter irrigation. Occasionally, this may require surgical repositioning with omentectomy or catheter replacement. Abdominal pain is observed usually after catheter insertion, but should improve and PD should be a painless procedure. Abdominal pain is often seen with peritonitis, though pain after instillation occurs occasionally with either PD fluid not at room temperature or due to abdominal distension. Pain after drainage can occur early after initiation of PD when the peritoneum is drained completely. Such patients can benefit from tidal prescription. Hemoperitoneum can be seen infrequently in children receiving PD. It can be observed sometimes in ovulating female patients during or 2 to 3 days before menstrual periods. Other causes include postinsertion, coagulopathy, pancreatitis, or other intra-abdominal pathology. In children, it can also be due to trauma to the abdomen or the catheter. Leakage most often occurs during the first few days of dialysis, especially when initial exchange volumes are too large, when the catheter is frequently manipulated (as in too aggressive exit site care), or when traction of any type is placed on the catheter (as during weighing or repositioning of the patient). Delaying the start of dialysis until PD catheter has a good seal will help; if that is not an option, then starting with a lower exchange volume can be helpful. Hernias are observed more frequently in children than in adults receiving PD. Hernias could be incisional, inguinal, paraumbilical, umbilical, or lumbar. Inguinal hernias occur more commonly in boys. A patent processus vaginalis can result in formation of such hernias early after initiation of PD. Laparoscopic placement of PD catheters allows inspection of such sites and prophylactic herniorraphy if needed. If hernias do occur, they often require surgical correction. Hydrothorax is an uncommon complication of PD in children. A recent European registry has reported a low prevalence rate of 0.66% among 1506 children. Pleural effusion is usually unilateral (right more than left) and can occur either within a few hours or can be delayed for weeks to months after initiation. In many patients, it occurs secondary to a small diaphragmatic defect, while in others is postulated secondary to subdiaphragmatic lymphatics. It requires stopping PD and may require switch to another modality in most, though in a few instances, surgical closure of the defect or pleurodesis have been performed. Chyloperitoneum is a rare complication of PD, though it can occur spontaneously in neonates and has been reported in association with catheter insertion. The presence of cloudy, almost milky dialysate in the absence of any indication of peritonitis suggests the diagnosis; a dialysate triglyceride level that exceeds the plasma triglyceride level can confirm it, as can lipoprotein electrophoresis analysis of drained dialysate. A diet containing only medium-chain triglycerides may allow continuation of PD. Membrane failure is rare in children on PD; it can be either an ultrafiltration failure due to a rapid absorption of glucose (type 1 failure) thereby dissipating the osmotic gradient or due to decreased effective peritoneal surface area secondary to adhesions (type 2). Long-term PD is a significant risk factor for development of type 2 failure. Patients present with poor ultrafiltration despite use of higher dialysate glucose concentrations. Blood-tinged fluid has been described in patients with peritoneal calcifications. Repeated episodes of peritonitis is also a risk factor for development of membrane failure. Peritoneal equilibration test can be used to diagnose solute clearance in such situations.

      "vitamin B12 Answer C Anemia is a common sequela of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with nearly 90% of children on dialysis requiring an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). However, the maintenance of normal hemoglobin levels in patients with renal disease requires optimizing those factors that contribute to erythropoiesis while also minimizing any accelerated red blood cell turnover. Erythropoietin (EPO) is primarily produced by the type 1 interstitial cells (fibroblasts) of the renal cortex, with small amounts produced by the liver and macrophages. As the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases and less oxygen is utilized by the proximal tubule for renal resorption of sodium, oxygen pressure increases in renal tissue, which is sensed by the type 1 interstitial cells, and EPO production is decreased. Erythropoietin acts directly in the marrow to suppress erythroid progenitor apoptosis, therefore, a decrease in EPO production, as seen with decreasing GFR, causes a decrease in erythroid cell maturation. Since the advent of ESA use in the 1980s, treatment of the anemia of CKD has featured the use of ESAs, which bind the EPO receptor in the marrow. However, as more potential adverse effects are being noted with this class of medication, newer classes of anemia therapies have focused on increasing natural EPO production. Transcription of the EPO gene is primarily controlled by hypoxia- inducible factors (HIFs), which bind regulatory regions downstream. Prolyl and asparaginase hydroxylases have been shown to inhibit HIF production and thus inhibit EPO gene transcription, while GATA has been shown to bind areas of EPO promotion and block its transcription. There is increasing interest in inhibitors of GATA, prolyl, and asparaginase hydroxylases as possible upregulators of local EPO production, with some agents being prepared for phase III clinical trials. However, there may be limited efficacy of promoters of EPO production in patients that are anephric, like in this vignette. Additionally, prolyl hydroxylase inhibits, rather than promotes, EPO production and therefore would potentially worsen anemia, so it is incorrect. If a patient does not respond appropriately to ESA with improvement of hemoglobin (Hgb) values, the patient should be considered ESA-hyporesponsive and reasons for this lack of responsiveness should be pursued and, if possible, corrected. The Table includes many of the other factors, in addition to having insufficient EPO production, which may contribute to anemia in CKD by either limiting erythropoiesis (iron deficiency, inflammation, bone marrow suppression) or increasing red blood cell turnover. Additionally, there are some additional risk factors for anemia specific to patients receiving hemodialysis (HD), which are specially marked (by a double asterisk) in this Table . An evaluation of anemia in CKD, including dialysis, should initially start with a complete blood cell count, reticulocyte count, and iron studies while other laboratory evaluations may be added depending on the clinical scenario. Erythropoietin deficiency by itself typically causes a normocytic anemia with an inappropriately low reticulocyte count. If there are abnormal red cell indices or atypical findings in other cell lines, other contributing factors to anemia should be considered. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) results can be very helpful. An elevated RDW, in addition to a high MCV, is suggestive of folate or vitamin B12 deficiency correlates with a high MCV and elevated RDW result. An elevated RDW is more sensitive than a low MCV for finding early onset-cases of iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is common in CKD, especially after the initiation of ESA use when iron demands are increased with greater erythropoiesis. Additionally, patients receiving HD have an even greater risk of iron deficiency as they have additional blood lost in the dialysis filter and tubing with each treatment. Estimates of the annual supplemental iron needs for adult dialysis patients are 0.7 to 1.0 g for patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 2 to 2.5 g for patients on HD. Similarly, pediatric annual estimates based off of body surface area are also higher in children receiving HD at 1.6 g/1.73 m2 per year versus only 0.9 g/1.73 m2 per year for PD. The evaluation of iron status should include a ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels. The TSAT is the measure of iron immediately available for Hgb synthesis as the fraction of iron bound to transferrin and is calculated as the serum iron divided by total iron binding capacity (TIBC) multiplied by 100%. In patients with CKD, the therapeutic target is 20% or more. Serum ferritin reflects total iron body stores and a low serum ferritin level has been shown to be a specific predictor of iron deficiency in pediatric CKD. However, ferritin is also an acute phase reactant and may be elevated in the face of systemic inflammation or malnutrition, reducing its reliability of iron status at very elevated levels. In the vignette, our patient has a calculated TSAT of 48% and ferritin of 500, both of which would be considered in the normal range, especially after having received a blood transfusion and additional doses of intravenous iron in the preceding month. Even though absolute iron deficiency often may occur with initiation of HD, our patient had anemia while on PD. The role of inflammation and its effect on anemia status has been clarified to some extent by the discovery of hepcidin. Hepcidin affects the turnover of the iron exporter, ferroportin, on the cell surface of enterocytes and may be the key factor in the “functional iron deficiency” of inflammation (low serum iron because it is trapped in the reticuloendothelial system) seen with CKD. Some have cited using elevated ferritin levels as one way to distinguish between “absolute” and “functional” iron deficiency, however, there is no absolute cut-off value of ferritin that can make this distinction. The evaluation for inflammation may include other laboratory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or serum albumin. Treatment of “functional iron deficiency” would be to control inflammation, which may be less straightforward in some conditions. If the primary etiology of CKD is an inflammatory disease (eg, lupus nephritis), then better disease control with the use of appropriate immunosuppressants may be indicated. Aspirin has also been associated with lower markers of inflammation while other studies have shown that correction of vitamin D deficiency in CKD has been associated with lower hepcidin levels. Vitamin C supplementation has been shown to overcome functional iron deficiency in HD patients with elevated ferritin levels, though it is not recommended for all patients because of the associated increase in urinary oxalate excretion. Patients receiving HD are at higher risk of having inflammation due to a repeated contact of blood with the dialyzer membrane causes some inflammatory reaction. Often, this reaction causes imperceptible changes, but it occasionally may cause complement activation and intradialytic symptoms. Additionally, the presence of an HD catheter is another source of inflammation to patients, as it is associated with higher CRP levels, lower albumin levels, and the need for greater ESA doses than in patients that dialyze via fistulas. In the vignette, the patient has a greater risk of inflammation because of HD catheter. However, his CRP and albumin levels are normal, as is the level of 25- hydroxyvitamin D. Therefore, treating inflammation by correcting vitamin D deficiency does not seem to be present in this scenario and is less likely to be effective in treating the preexisting anemia. A third mechanism in which HD patients are at increased risk of anemia, compared to PD patients, are from increased clearance of substances essential for the formation or maintenance of erythrocytes. This includes the water-soluble B vitamins (pyridoxine [B ] cobalamin [B ]), folate, copper, and 6 , 12 carnitine. Vitamin B and folate are both required for DNA synthesis of erythropoiesis, and a 12 deficiency of either would cause a macrocytic anemia. Vitamin B is required for heme synthesis, in 6 addition to acting as a coenzyme for nutritional metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. Its deficiency can cause a microcytic anemia similar to iron deficiency. Copper is essential for iron transport and its severe deficiency can cause anemia (macro-, micro-, or normocytic), often with neutropenia, in addition to peripheral neuropathy. Supplementation with a dialysis-specific multivitamin will adequately replace the B vitamins, while folate and copper deficiency are uncommon in HD patients unless there is additional malnutrition. Carnitine, which has also been referred to as Vitamin B , is a small molecule that is primarily stored in T muscle tissue where it serves an essential role in mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids and the production of energy. Its deficiency has been associated with cardiomyopathy and, in HD patients, intradialytic hypotension. However, carnitine is also thought to stabilize the cellular membrane of erythrocytes and thus prevents anemia by prolonging red blood cell half-life, which is already reduced in patients with CKD. Carnitine is significantly cleared by HD, as levels may be reduced 75% with treatments. Therefore, carnitine deficiency may occur in HD patients, especially if they are anephric (as the kidney and liver can both produce carnitine) and have malnutrition. Carnitine deficiency is also associated with a very high dose of prescribed HD (more frequent or prolonged dialysis treatments) and a longer dialysis vintage. Standard administration of carnitine to anemic HD patients has been quite controversial and is not currently recommended, but a trial should be considered in patients “when all other causes…have been excluded” and they have documented low serum levels. In this vignette, the subject has a persistent anemia without evidence of malnutrition as the albumin level and normalized protein catabolic rate are normal. He has normal red blood cell indices of MCV and RDW, making vitamin B deficiency a very unlikely cause of anemia. Additionally, he has only had 12 a short vintage of standardly dosed (3 times weekly) HD, making it unlikely that he developed carnitine deficiency. However, in the absence of other attributable causes of anemia and given his anephric status, checking free and total serum carnitine levels would be appropriate, as would be treating low levels if discovered. Other possible contributors to anemia in CKD include uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism and the use of medications with bone marrow suppressive effects. Hyperparathyroidism has long been shown to cause suppression of erythropoiesis. It was originally thought that hyperparathyroidism contributed to bone marrow fibrosis, but elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) may also have a negative effect on natural EPO production and erythroid progenitor cell maturation. Lower EPO requirements and improved hemoglobin levels have been associated with treatment of hyperparathyroidism by the use of vitamin D analogs as well as by parathyroidectomy, with decreased bone marrow fibrosis seen with improved PTH control. In this vignette, the patient appears to have a persistent anemia, preexisting before his conversion to HD. His PTH level is elevated along with an elevated serum phosphorus level, so he has hyperparathyroidism. Treatment of his hyperparathyroidism with paricalcitol is likely to help ameliorate his anemia. PREP Pearls  Patients undergoing hemodialysis have increased risk of anemia stemming from greater iron (blood) loss in the dialysis filter and tubing, higher propensity for inflammation especially if dialyzing via a catheter, and greater dialytic removal of elements essential to erythropoiesis.  Iron deficiency, either “absolute” or “functional”, is the most common cause of erythropoiesis- stimulating agent hyporesponsiveness in patients with chronic kidney disease and should be addressed first.  Vitamin deficiencies are uncommon in dialysis patients, unless they also have poor nutritional intake or non-adherence to recommended (water-soluble) vitamin supplementation American Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)  Recognize the etiologic principles and management of the anemia in dialysis patients Suggested Readings  Badve SV, Beller EM, Cass A, et al.

      "reduce proteinuria Answer A For the patient described in the vignette, the therapeutic intervention that may slow the progression of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) is to maintain blood pressure close to the 50th percentile. Neither maintaining blood pressure just below the 95th percentile nor reducing dietary intake of protein to below the recommended daily allowance will slow CKD progression. In the Effect of Strict Blood Pressure Control and ACE Inhibition on the Progression of CRF in Pediatric Patients (ESCAPE) trial, proteinuria decreased by 50% initially after successful control of blood pressure but gradually reappeared. Despite that, the intense blood pressure regimen resulted in significant slowing of CKD progression. The degree of proteinuria in this patient is mild; therefore, reduction of proteinuria is not the most likely means to slow CKD progression. Progression of CKD in children and adolescents has not been well studied. The Chronic Kidney Diseases in Children (CKiD) cohort assessed risk factors for progression in 496 children and adolescents with CKD. Risks factors, including urinary protein-creatinine ratio greater than 2, hypoalbuminemia, elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia, male sex, and anemia, influenced times to composite event of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decrease significantly by 79%, 69%, 38%, 40%, 38%, and 45%, respectively, in patients with nonglomerular diseases. Risk factors, including urinary protein-creatinine ratio greater than 2, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated blood pressure, influenced progression by 94%, 71%, and 67%, respectively, in patients with glomerular diseases. These results were then cross-validated internally. This large, prospective cohort study provides evidence that in pediatric patients with CKD, there are a number of well-defined and potentially modifiable factors that significantly and predictably shorten the decrease in GFR. Continued evaluation of this cohort should make it possible to further refine our understanding of progression of CKD in children and inform the further intervention trials. Some studies have suggested that dietary protein restriction may help slow progression in CKD. A prospective trial in children with CKD was performed to assess the efficacy of dietary protein restriction on growth and CKD progression. Three groups of children with different disease categories were randomized to dietary protein restriction or normal diet. Protein intake was reduced to 0.8 to 1.1 g/kg daily adjusted for age, within the lowest World Health Organization (WHO) requirements. Calorie intake was recommended to be at least 70% of the WHO requirements. Creatinine clearance was used to monitor renal function every 2 months. Dietary diaries and urine urea were measured to monitor adherence. Growth and CKD progression were not affected by dietary protein restriction. The study found that dietary protein restriction did not affect CKD progression in children with CKD. Secondary analysis revealed that systolic blood pressure and proteinuria were significant risk factors for CKD progression. Although blood pressure is known to be a significant risk factor for CKD progression, optimal level of blood pressure control is not known. The ESCAPE trial aimed to define blood pressure targets to slow CKD progression in children. Ramipril (6 mg/m2 of body surface area per day) was prescribed to 385 children with CKD and hypertension. Their 24-hour blood pressures were monitored and adjusted to one group with mean arterial pressures in the 50th to 95th percentile (conventional) or below the 50th percentile (strict control). The follow-up was 5 years. CKD progression was the primary end point and was defined as the time to either end-stage disease or decrease in GFR of 50%. The 24-hour blood pressure, proteinuria, and GFR were the secondary end points. After 5 years, strict control had a significant beneficial effect on CKD progression. Proteinuria decreased by 50% initially after successful control of blood pressure but gradually reappeared. There was no difference in the withdrawal rate from the study or adverse effects among the 2 groups of patients.
