      "there is a1 in 2 chance that her next child will have nephrotic syndrome The child in the vignette has infantile nephrotic syndrome associated with a WT7 mutation in exon 9. Most commonly, mutations in exons 8 or 9 of W77 are associated with Denys-Drash syndrome. Denys-Drash syndrome consists of nephropathy, genital abnormalities (male pseudohermaphroditism in classic cases), and increased risk for Wilms tumor. W77 mutations may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but may also occur de novo. Due to gonadal dysgenesis, men with these mutations are typically infertile, but incomplete penetrance may occur. Thus, the preferred response would be to assess if the parents are carriers of the W77 mutation. Without knowing if the parents are carriers, the likelihood of the next child having the nephrotic syndrome cannot be predicted. Maternal serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) measurement at 15 to 18 weeks’ gestation has been effectively used to screen for nephrotic syndrome http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/january?req=201908240933489958... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 5 caused by NPHS7 mutations in the Finnish population, but similar studies have not been published for Denys-Drash syndrome. In addition, genetic testing of Finnish mothers for maternal WPHS7 carrier risk has been reported as an alternative screening approach. Congenital nephrotic syndrome presents in the first 3 months after birth. Infantile nephrotic syndrome presents from 4 months to 12 months of age. It is associated with prematurity, low birthweight, and enlarged placental size (>25% of birthweight) as well as dysmorphic features in some cases (small, snub nose). Bilateral enlarged echogenic kidneys may be seen on prenatal or postnatal ultrasonography. The histopathology varies, with Finnish-type congenital nephrotic syndrome typically manifesting as microcystic dilations of the proximal tubule, with immature and sclerosed glomeruli. An alternative histopathologic entity, diffuse mesangial sclerosis, may also be identified in congenital or infantile nephrotic syndrome, particularly with certain genetic mutations. Genetic studies have increased our knowledge of the frequency of various mutations in congenital and infantile nephrotic syndrome. Although more than 40 genes are associated with nephrotic syndrome, mutations in 4 genes (NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1, and LAMB2) are most likely to be identified in infants with congenital nephrotic syndrome (between 66% and 85% in some cohorts) and in up to 40% of those with infantile nephrotic syndrome (Table). PLCE7 mutations are present in a small percentage of patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome but up to approximately 8% of those with infantile nephrotic syndrome. Mutations in components of the coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis pathway (COQ2, COQ6, PDSS2, and ADCK4) may also present as congenital or infantile nephrotic syndrome. Elevated maternal serum AFP (22.5 times the median) at 15 to 19 weeks’ gestation has been used for prenatal screening for congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type. Finnish-type congenital nephrosis (CNS) had a prevalence of up to 1 in 2,600 in Finland (now decreased due to screening). Ninety percent of cases are associated with either MPHS7 Fin-major (frameshift and a stop codon in exon 2 leading to truncated protein) or Fin-minor (nonsense mutation in exon 26, also leads to a truncated protein) WPHS7 mutations. Increased maternal serum AFP is thought to result from fetal urinary protein leakage in utero, leading to elevated amniotic and maternal http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/january?req=201908240933489958... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 serum AFP. In women with elevated serum AFP, amniocentesis was performed to assess amniotic fluid AFP. An elevated amniotic fluid AFP greater than 5 times the median (in the absence of neurologic or other abnormality on ultrasonography) was considered likely CNS, with those with levels between 2.5 and 5 times the median considered at high risk for CNS. However, later studies indicate that heterozygous carriers can also have transient elevated maternal serum and amniotic AFP, and thus genetic approaches for screening are being used more often. Several approaches are being used for prenatal testing of genetic disorders, including fluorescence in situ hybridization and comparative genome hybridization. However, for monogenic disorders such as congenital nephrotic syndrome, gene sequencing is required. Prenatal genetic testing can be performed on in vitro-fertilized embryos before implantation (preimplantation genetic screening). For genetic testing during pregnancy, sequencing typically requires an invasive procedure of amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS).The discovery of circulating cell-free fetal DNA in maternal serum has allowed for noninvasive diagnosis of some monogenic disorders and may be more common in the future. There are several important differences between CVS and amniocentesis. CVS is typically performed at 11 to 12 weeks of gestation whereas amniocentesis is performed at 15 to 18 weeks of gestation. In CVS, a catheter or needle is used to sample placental cells derived from the fetus. The procedure is performed either transcervically or transabdominally, depending on the location of the placenta. Typically, the cells can be directly used for DNA sequencing, but cultures of these cells can also be performed. In amniocentesis, approximately 15 mL of amniotic fluid is removed under ultrasound guidance. To detect monogenic disorders, cultures of the fetal cells shed in the amniotic fluid may need to be performed (often for 2 weeks) before DNA sequencing, and contamination of cultures with maternal cells can lead to difficulties in diagnosis. Both methods have risks: CVS increases the risk of limb deformities (1 in 3,000 to 1 in 1,000) and is associated with approximately 1% risk of miscarriage. Amniocentesis also carries a miscarriage risk, estimated to be 0.25% to 0.5%. Overall, CVS gives better material and earlier opportunity to make a monogenic diagnosis but may be higher risk. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/january?req=201908240933489958... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 PREP Pearls * NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1, LAMB2 and PLCE7 mutations are the most common defects associated with congenital/infantile nephrotic syndrome.

      "whole body computed tomography The patient in the vignette has bone pain, severe hypophosphatemia, excessive urinary phosphate loss, and osteopenia. Normal growth and development and absence of a family history of bone disease suggest that this is an acquired disorder. The differential diagnosis of hypophosphatemia includes disorders of vitamin D metabolism, parathyroid hormone, and inherited and acquired defects in renal tubular phosphate reabsorption. This patient has normal serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D3 and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, which does not support a diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency-induced osteomalacia. Hereditary hypophosphatemia (HHP) can be divided into X-linked, autosomal dominant, and recessive categories. These patients usually present during infancy and early childhood, especially after weight bearing has begun, with symptoms and signs of rickets. X-linked and autosomal-dominant forms of HHP are caused by mutations in genes encoding proteases (PHEX and DMP-7) that degrade phosphatonins (ie, FGF-23), whereas autosomal-recessive HHP results from an intrinsic mutation in FGF-23 that renders it resistant to degradation. Accordingly, HHP is characterized by an elevated circulating level of FGF-23, which inhibits proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption and also inhibits 1-alpha-hydroxylase http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/january?req=201908240934226359... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 activity. Although the patient in the vignette manifests many (if not all) of the biochemical abnormalities of HHP, her normal growth and absence of a family history of metabolic bone disease do not support this diagnosis. When an older child has recent onset of the clinical, radiologic, and biochemical findings that mimic HHP, one must look for an acquired cause of elevated circulating levels of FGF-23, usually a benign mesenchymal tumor of bone such as hemangiopericytoma. In tumor-induced osteomalacia, also called oncogenic osteomalacia, the tumor tissue releases excessive amounts of FGF-23, which results in excessive urinary phosphate losses and hypophosphatemia, accompanied by inappropriately low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, but normal serum PTH and calcium levels. FGF-23-releasing tumors tend to express high levels of somatostatin receptors; hence, the best imaging study to detect these tumors is 111-indium octreotide scintigraphy combined with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), which is the recommended next step for the patient in the vignette. In questionable cases or if PET/CT scans show multiple tumors, selective venous sampling and measurement of FGF-23 will be helpful in determining the site of FGF-23-producing tumor(s). Resection of the tumor usually results in normalization of FGF-23 levels and urinary phosphate excretion within days to weeks and resolution of the bone disease. Treatment with phosphate supplement, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and subcutaneous octreotide (somatostatin receptor agonist) lessens the severity of the bone disease and hypophosphatemia until the responsible tumor has been localized and resected. FGF-23 monoclonal antibody preparation is currently under development, and its role in the treatment of tumor-induced osteomalacia in the future needs to be explored. PREP Pearls + New-onset bone disease and osteopenia of unknown cause in the presence of hypophosphatemia and phosphaturia in an older child should prompt investigation of tumor-induced osteomalacia. + The use of octreotide (somatostatin receptor agonist) is beneficial in reducing circulating FGF-23 levels and urinary phosphate loss. + Indium scintigraphy combined with single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography is a useful diagnostic tool to localize the tumor(s) responsible for tumor-induced osteomalacia. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/january?req=201908240934226359... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 4 ABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area + Recognize the biochemical and clinical features and the natural history of tumor-induced osteomalacia + Know the appropriate therapy for tumor-induced osteomalacia Suggested Readings Chong WH, Andreopoulou P, Chen CC, et al.

The fibrotic changes caused by chronic CNI http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/january?req=201908240934575572.... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 3 overexposure can be diffuse or striped in distribution, with striped fibrosis considered pathognomonic for CNI-related ischemic damage to watershed areas of the transplant. Chronic antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) can also lead to IFTA but would be expected to feature transplant glomerulopathy with double contours in glomerular basement membranes. Moreover, more fluctuating CNI trough levels are commonly seen in patients who develop chronic AMR (as are circulating donor-specific antibodies, which are now routinely screened for by many programs). Lastly, special stains beyond light microscopy often detect C4d deposition along the peritubular capillaries in AMR. Special stains for BK virus are also helpful in the diagnosis of BK nephropathy, but the absence of viral inclusions and tubulitis on light microscopy as well as the negative blood screening results for BK virus make BK nephropathy unlikely in the vignette, even though IFTA can certainly be seen in prolonged cases of this condition. The term chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) has historically been used as a catch-all phrase for chronic histologic changes (including IFTA) in kidney transplants. At present, however, chronic allograft nephropathy is no longer considered specific enough to allow meaningful interpretations of histologic findings and subsequent specific management decisions and should thus be avoided. In the vignette, the light microscopic findings support a specific adjustment in the patient's immunosuppressive regimen away from generous CNI exposure to a reduction in immunosuppression or a change to a different form of immunosuppression. A similar adjustment might be required had there been evidence of BK nephropathy, whereas findings of chronic AMR may have warranted more aggressive immunosuppression.

Hypertension is the main modifiable risk factor that contributes to the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among patients with end-stage kidney disease. Therefore, proper screening, recognition, evaluation, and treatment of elevated blood pressure is of paramount importance for these at-risk children. In children receiving chronic dialysis, hypertension may be caused by various factors, with the most common being sodium and volume overload. Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis remove excess fluid and sodium, with http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/january?req=201908240936107747... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 6 prescriptions aimed at achieving the patient's estimated dry weight. Once they achieve dry weight and euvolemia, dialysis-dependent patients can have normal blood pressure without the assistance of an antihypertensive medication. Essential to maintaining euvolemia, however, is strict adherence to sodium and fluid restriction. In fact, the biggest driver of increased fluid intake is thirst related to sodium intake, so patients need to be counseled on how to limit sodium intake per guidelines (Table ). When successful, the effect on blood pressure can be substantial. One study of 218 adults receiving hemodialysis demonstrated a reduction in blood pressure from 150/89 mm Hg to 121/75 mm Hg over a follow-up period of 47+ 34 months with sodium and volume restriction. Only 9 of the enrolled patients needed an antihypertensive medication to achieve normotension. Many patients find it difficult to adhere to the dietary restrictions and will have a significant amount of interdialytic weight gain. When this weight gain is excessive (ie, >2-3 kg between hemodialysis sessions), it may not be possible to achieve one’s estimated dry weight with the routine 3- to 4-hour thrice-weekly dialysis. As such, volume can “stack” and lead to greater blood pressure measurements over time. In addition to sodium retention and volume overload, other potential causes of hypertension among children receiving dialysis include renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system activation, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, endothelial dysfunction, hyperparathyroidism, and medication use (erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and calcineurin inhibitors). Because of the predominant role of sodium and fluid excess on blood pressure among children, the timing and method of blood pressure measurement is important when screening for hypertension. Predialysis blood pressure measurement in the hemodialysis unit may not provide a reliable estimate of a child's interdialytic blood pressure due to multiple factors. These include white coat phenomenon, limited time for rest with multiple measurements obtained via manual auscultation at the start of hemodialysis, anxiety related to impending needle placement/dialysis session, and the fact that the child is at his or her maximal fluid-overloaded state. Comparison of pre- and postdialysis blood pressures are also not http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/january?req=201908240936107747... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 6 ideal. These measurements only capture 1 moment in time, at the extremes of sodium and volume status. The difference in blood pressure between the 2 measurements will also depend on the amount of fluid that can be removed during dialysis. These peridialysis measurements over- and underestimate blood pressure between dialysis sessions. When compared to 44-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), prehemodialysis systolic blood pressure measurements in adults were between 42 mm Hg higher and 25 mm Hg lower. The difference was just as striking for posthemodialysis systolic blood pressure: measurements were between 33 mm Hg higher and 36 mm Hg lower than that obtained via ABPM. In addition to these limitations of pre- and postdialysis blood pressure measurements, equilibration occurs after the dialysis session is complete and many individuals resume their usual diets, which often provide more sodium than recommended. A study of adults demonstrated that for every 10 hours after hemodialysis, blood pressure increased by 4 mm Hg. Furthermore, even when dry weight is ultimately achieved and maintained, it can take several months for the blood pressure to normalize (ie, “lag phenomenon’). Intradialytic blood pressure measurements are also obtained in addition to the pre- and postdialysis blood pressure measurements to monitor for cardiovascular response and tolerance of the dialysis procedure. The average intradialytic blood pressure obtained during a midweek dialysis session has been used to screen for hypertension. While providing superior sensitivity and specificity than the pre- and post-blood pressure measurements in diagnosing interdialytic hypertension, this method should not be relied upon as the sole method to diagnose hypertension for many of the same reasons as described before. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, specifically 44-hour ABPM done midweek during the interdialytic period should be the gold standard for diagnosing hypertension in a patient receiving chronic dialysis. These measurements correlate the best with target organ damage and cardiovascular events and will often show a linear increase in blood pressure as an individual's fluid and sodium intake increases. Additional advantages of http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/january?req=201908240936107747... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 6 ABPM include identifying white coat hypertension, nocturnal hypertension, masked hypertension, and nondipping status, all of which have important prognostic implications. When ABPM is not available or feasible, self-recorded home blood pressure measurements can be helpful in the management of hypertension in the patient receiving dialysis. These measurements, when done properly (with proper positioning, with an appropriate-sized cuff, after 5 minutes of rest and done at least 2 times 1-2 minutes apart), are most closely associated with 44-hour ABPM measurements. These measurements also have greater reproducibility and are more predictive of target organ damage and cardiovascular events than peridialytic blood pressure measurements. Home blood pressure measurements, when obtained via ABPM or seated resting measurements, are also superior when performed under optimal measurement conditions: they are not obtained proximal to venipuncture, there are no medical professionals present to induce the white coat effect, and these measurements can be obtained before the occurrence of maximal fluid overload. When home blood pressure measurements are used to manage hypertension, they should be obtained and recorded in the following manner: + Hemodialysis patients: Morning and evening blood pressure should be measured and recorded on 6 nondialysis days over a 2-week period. + Peritoneal dialysis patients: Seven consecutive daily morning and evening blood pressure measurements should be recorded. Once hypertension is diagnosed, treatment should be tailored to the etiology of blood pressure elevation. Because most hypertension is related to fluid and sodium overload, maximizing the dialysis prescription and intensifying dietary counseling to achieve dry weight is essential for treatment. Dry weight has been defined as the lowest postdialysis weight achievable without signs or symptoms of hypo- or hypervolemia. In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, other tools are available to help determine and achieve an individual's dry weight. These tools include http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/january?req=201908240936107747... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 5 of 6 bioimpedance plethysmography, lung ultrasonography, relative plasma volume monitoring, measurement of the inferior vena cava diameter, and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration. Using a combination of these tools and clinical judgement, the individual's target dry weight should be challenged slowly over time (over days to weeks). Occasionally, the dialysis prescription may need to be altered during this time to achieve dry weight. With hemodialysis, longer dialysis sessions and a lower dialysate sodium concentration may be required. With peritoneal dialysis, an adaptive prescription (shorter, smaller fills in the beginning followed by longer, larger fills) may be used, if available, for maximal sodium and fluid removal. Once dry weight is achieved, if the patient remains hypertensive, other etiologies should be explored. The medication list should be reviewed for medications known to cause hypertension and for those with hidden sodium content (eg, each 1 g of kayexalate powder contains 1 g of sodium). Hyperparathyroidism should be corrected, and obstructive apnea screening should be considered. Thus, for the patient in the vignette, the best method to screen for hypertension is via 44-hour ABPM. Peridialytic blood pressure measurements have many limitations and do not correlate with target organ damage, whereas ABPM does. Self-recorded home blood pressure measurements may be used to manage hypertension when ABPM is not available. PREP Pearls + Hypertension in a patient receiving chronic dialysis should preferably be diagnosed based on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. + Self-recorded home morning and evening blood pressure measurements obtained over 2 weeks on nondialysis days for those patients receiving hemodialysis or over 7 consecutive days for those receiving peritoneal dialysis is helpful in the management of hypertension. + Sodium and volume overload is by far the most common cause of hypertension among children receiving chronic dialysis. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/january?req=201908240936107747... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 6 of 6 + If hypertension persists once sodium and volume status is optimized, one should review medications and comorbidities for additional etiologies.

      "the single nephron glomerular filtration rate in the left kidney is expected to be higher than normal A solitary kidney in children usually is congenital but can also be acquired. Congenital causes include agenesis, severe hypodysplasia, and multicystic dysplastic kidney, as described in the vignette. Acquired causes that lead to http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/january?q-page=6&req=2019082409... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 3 nephrectomy include tumor, thrombosis, and trauma. Regardless of the cause, the contralateral unaffected kidney undergoes an adaptive process termed compensatory hypertrophy. This process entails essentially a functional increase in glomerular filtration in the remaining nephrons and leads to increased glomerular pressure and filtration, also termedhyperfiltration. As a result, the kidney undergoing compensatory hypertrophy will increase in size and should have a renal length more than 2 standard deviations above the mean for age. This process is why living donors can safely donate a single kidney and not experience a true reduction in renal function of 50%. Overall, most people with a solitary kidney will experience an excellent long-term course. A debate exists as to whether hyperfiltration in the setting of compensatory hypertrophy may be detrimental to the kidney over time. The adverse outcome would be manifested by hypertension and proteinuria; thus, these patients should receive periodic monitoring throughout life. In this vignette, we would expect that the left kidney will undergo compensatory hypertrophy. At the single nephron level, glomerular pressure and flow increase. Thus, the single nephron glomerular filtration rate increases. Wilson et al demonstrated a clear correlation between glomerular filtration rate and renal length. Although some animal models demonstrate nephrogenesis after birth, no evidence exists that any nephrogenesis occurs in full-term infants after birth. Finally, most studies demonstrate that compensatory hypertrophy occurs in 50% to 80% of all patients with solitary kidney, regardless of the etiology. The absence of compensatory hypertrophy reflects either hypoplasia or dysplasia in the unaffected kidney, or possibly acquired scarring after urinary tract infection. Alaygut et al showed that congenital causes of solitary kidneys have a larger degree of compensatory hypertrophy than acquired causes. Thus, the likelihood that the child in this vignette will have dysplasia or hypoplasia in the contralateral kidney and a lack of compensatory hypertrophy is very low, certainly less than 90%. PREP Pearls * Compensatory hypertrophy is secondary to hyperfiltration and not nephrogenesis. * Glomerular filtration rate is positively correlated to renal length. + Most children with congenital causes of solitary kidney will have compensatory hypertrophy in the normal-appearing kidney. http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/january?q-page=6&req=2019082409... 8/24/2019 January | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 3 ABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area + Understand the clinical concept of compensatory renal hypertrophy Suggested Readings Alaygut D, Soylu A, Kasap B, Turkmen M, Cakmakci H, Kavukcu S.

      "family history The patient in the vignette was born premature and small for gestational age. Studies have demonstrated associations between low birthweight and the subsequent development of hypertension. In both developed and developing countries, an inverse relationship has been described between http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/february?req=201908241005019641... 8/24/2019 February | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 4 birthweight and blood pressure in adulthood. This relationship exists for both cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. For example, infants born with birthweights of about 3 kg have a 10-times higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome in adulthood compared with those born at 4.3 kg. Other studies have shown for every 1-kg increase in birthweight, there is a 20% reduction in cardiovascular disease and 2-mm lower blood pressure in adulthood. In one study, low birthweight was associated with a 3-fold higher odds ratio for systolic hypertension in adulthood. Studies in adolescents have been less convincing. One of the key factors in this association is thought to be nephron number. Birthweight is one of the primary determinants of nephron number. Kidneys typically have between 500,000 and 2 million nephrons. Studies have shown that a 1-kg increase of birthweight is associated with approximately an additional 250,000 nephrons. The heredity of hypertension is well known. In twin studies, concordance of blood pressure between monozygotic and dizygotic twins is significantly different, with r? of approximately 0.36 vs 0.09, respectively. The presence of hypertension in both parents gives an odds ratio of approximately 2.5 for their children to develop hypertension, after adjusting for body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, physical activity, and cigarette smoking. If parents have early onset hypertension, before age 55 years, the odds ratio can increase to over 6. The genetic basis for hypertension has been intensely studied. Genome-wide association studies in multiple populations have shown several loci associated with the development of hypertension. This is distinct and different from monogenic causes of hypertension, such as Liddle syndrome, which comprise fewer than 1% of cases of adult hypertension. The loci found in genome-wide association studies individually contribute a miniscule amount to blood pressure variation. At this time, clinical genetic analysis of these loci is not available. Increases in BMI and obesity in the pediatric and adult population have led to increases in blood pressure. A recent meta-analysis shows that children with overweight had an increase of 4.5 mm Hg, and children with obesity had http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/february?req=201908241005019641... 8/24/2019 February | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 a7.5-mm Hg increase above the systolic blood pressure of normal-weight peers. The long-term potential impact of these blood pressure increases can be appreciated by the fact that a 10-mm increase in adult blood pressure results in approximately 30% to 40% increase in stroke and ischemic heart disease. However, the patient in the vignette has a normal BMI (overweight is defined as a BMI > 85th percentile). In the evaluation for hypertension, drug testing should be used selectively. The main focus would be for recreational drugs (eg, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine) or performance-enhancing drugs (eg, anabolic steroids, erythropoietin) that can raise blood pressure. There is nothing in the vignette suggesting abuse of illicit drugs or anabolic steroids. PREP Pearls + As compared to normal-weight peers, children with overweight have an average increase in systolic blood pressure of 4.5 mm Hg, and children with obesity have an average increase of 7.5 mm Hg. + Infants with birthweights of 3 kg or less have a 10-times higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome in adulthood compared with those born with birthweights of more than 4.3 kg. + A10-mm increase in adult blood pressure results in approximately 30% to 40% increase in stroke and ischemic heart disease.

      "she has severe menorrhagia from right ovarian cysts that are now inflamed and she needs hormone therapy Although all 4 diagnoses listed as response choices are plausible, the history and clinical features described in the vignette strongly indicate allograft intolerance as the most likely diagnosis. With that diagnosis, a strong consideration would be given to allograft nephrectomy. However, surgical removal of an acutely inflamed and friable allograft is not advisable partly because of difficulty in separation of surgical tissue planes and achieving hemostasis. Therefore, most transplant surgeons prefer to wait and first give a http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/february?q-page=2&req=201908240... 8/24/2019 February | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 4 short course of high-dose oral steroids to reduce the inflammation within and around the failed allograft, before proceeding to a semielective nephrectomy. Hence, steroids are the preferred treatment rather than immediate and nonelective nephrectomy. With kidney transplantation now being a viable option for more than 50 years, but median allograft survival being only 10 to 14 years and a growing waitlist for available kidneys, the chance that a patient will return to dialysis after a failed allograft is high. Increasing numbers of patients receiving dialysis now have a history of a prior failed renal allograft. In a patient for whom long-term dialysis is initiated after a failed renal allograft, the management remains vexing, with scant high-quality data available. Most of what we know is derived from large national registry studies from the United States or Canada, with potential biases and confounders. Thus, no guidelines exist for several important but unanswered questions, such as: 1) Which form of dialysis is better? 2) When should dialysis be initiated as the allograft fails? 3) How should immunosuppression be weaned, if at all? and 4) Should an allograft nephrectomy be performed pre-emptively? From the large registry studies, what we do know are the following: graft intolerance will occur in 30% to 50% of patients with failed allografts. However, we cannot predict at the time of graft failure who will develop intolerance. The likelihood of a nephrectomy is 2-fold higher after early graft loss (within the first year after kidney transplantation) than after late graft loss (> 1-2 years after kidney transplantation) in adults and more than 4-fold higher in children. Allograft nephrectomy mortality can be as high as 30% if performed in an emergent situation. The 90-day event rate for complications after allograft nephrectomy is death (4.7%), sepsis (6.2%), and myocardial infarction (1.1%). Paradoxically, an increased 12-month mortality rate (hazard ratio 1.13) is seen after allograft nephrectomy after early graft loss, compared with a slight protective effect (hazard ratio 0.89) if allograft nephrectomy is performed after late graft loss. These results are likely confounded by patients who experience early graft loss because they are sicker. Another unusual result from these studies is that panel reactive antibody (PRA) levels eventually declined after allograft nephrectomy if graft loss occurred early, whereas the PRA levels remained elevated at the same levels after allograft nephrectomy if the graft loss was late. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/february?q-page=2&req=201908240... 8/24/2019 February | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 If the failed allograft is inflamed or is causing clear intolerance, then removal is recommended. Preemptive removal is much more controversial. The advantages and disadvantages of preemptive allograft removal are listed in the Table. The clinical features of allograft intolerance include enlarged or tender allograft, fever, malaise, or gross hematuria. Secondary features that should alert the physician to think of allograft intolerance include an anemia that is resistant to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. The anemia is likely because of a chronic inflammatory state induced by the failed renal allograft, detectable with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels. The tapering of immunosuppression, after an allograft fails and the patient initiates chronic dialysis, is another area of controversy. Continuing immunosuppression at the same levels is not considered desirable, because the patient is then exposed to continuing high risks of infection and malignancy. Some studies suggest that rapid tapering of immunosuppression after nephrectomy is associated with a sudden rise in PRA. Other studies suggest that the PRA rises with the weaning of immunosuppression upon dialysis initiation, irrespective of whether an allograft nephrectomy was performed or not. We do not have good data on what to taper and how to taper the immunosuppression. In summary, allograft nephrectomy is necessary in some situations but we do not currently know how to prevent it or how to identify the best candidates for preemptive allograft nephrectomy. PREP Pearls + Allograft nephrectomy is needed in 30% to 50% of patients with a failed renal allograft. + Allograft nephrectomy is more difficult when the allograft is acutely inflamed, so high-dose oral steroids are often administered to first reduce the inflammation. + Allograft nephrectomy has both advantages and disadvantages.

Glomerular cysts per se are not pathognomonic of a specific congenital or acquired renal disease; accordingly, it is important to distinguish between the terms g/omerulocystic kidney(GCK) and GCKD. A GCK is defined by the presence of more than 5% cystic glomeruli. Glomerulocystic kidney disease is an inherited/familial subtype of GCK caused by defined genetic mutations. The following is a diagnostic classification of disease entities presenting with glomerular cysts: * Type |: Autosomal dominant or recessive polycystic kidney disease, which is familial and nonsyndromic and affects both kidneys * Type Il: Familial/nereditary GCKD caused by mutations in HNF1B/7CF2 or UMOD (uromodulin). The HNF7B/7CF2 mutations cause familial hypoplastic GCKD with or without diabetes. The UMOD mutations are associated with GCKD and hyperuricemia. Type Ill: Syndromic GCK, which can be unilateral or segmental and is seen in malformation syndromes such as trisomy 9, 13, or 18 * Type IV: Obstructive GCK with or without dysplasia; may be unilateral or bilateral * Type V: Sporadic GCK with no familial pattern that is nonsyndromic and caused by ischemia (usually unilateral) or is drug induced (bilateral). Renal biopsy, although not necessary for diagnosis, shows tubulointerstitial changes with dilated Bowman capsule and atrophied glomerulus. Treatment of GCKD is mostly supportive, and depending on its type, patients may need management of fluid and electrolytes, hypertension, diabetes, hyperuricemia, and progressive chronic kidney disease, including dialysis and renal transplantation. Unlike the glomerular cysts, large cysts involving predominantly the collecting ducts are observed in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. Tubular cysts with cartilage metaplasia are observed in renal dysplasia, and hyperplastic nephrogenic rests with large cysts are observed in cystic Wilms tumor.

Effective blood pressure treatment can delay the progression of CKD. Therefore, it is important to further evaluate the blood pressure elevations measured at home. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/february?req=201908241007141493... 8/24/2019 February | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 3 Patients with CKD have an increased incidence of masked hypertension, in which blood pressures are normal in office settings, but elevated in ambulatory settings. Masked hypertension is associated with target organ damage (eg, left ventricular hypertrophy) as well as faster progression of CKD. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can be used to diagnose masked or nocturnal hypertension, as well as other forms of blood pressure variability, including white coat hypertension. Notably, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring results correlate more strongly with target organ damage and left ventricular mass measurements than with office and/or casual home blood pressure measurements. Therefore, given that the patient in the vignette with CKD has elevated home blood pressure measurements, the most appropriate next step in management would be to arrange for 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. This will assess for masked hypertension as a potential cause for his normal office blood pressure. Blood pressure monitoring in additional ambulatory settings, such as with a school nurse, may be an adjunct to office- and home-based casual blood pressure measurements. However, like these other casual and intermittent blood pressure measurements, they do not correlate as strongly with important outcomes as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Recent guidelines question the reliability of school-based blood pressure measurements. The patient in the vignette with CKD stage 2 and FSGS should receive a more definitive evaluation for masked hypertension. Therefore, merely monitoring blood pressure with a school nurse alone is not adequate in lieu of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, but it may be done in conjunction with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Increasing the patient's dose of lisinopril to 20 mg daily may eventually be indicated. If masked hypertension were confirmed with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, this would be an excellent treatment approach. However, such a dose change may not be needed, especially given his well-controlled proteinuria. Therefore, further evaluation with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be pursued prior to making a dose adjustment. Continuing his current regimen is not the best next course of management either. His home blood pressure elevations might suggest that he has masked http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/february?req=201908241007141493... 8/24/2019 February | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 3 hypertension. Therefore, to treat his CKD and FSGS most effectively, further evaluation and additional monitoring should be performed to improve his blood pressure control, if applicable. PREP Pearls + Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can assist in the evaluation of intermittent blood pressure elevations and discrepancies between office and ambulatory measurements. + Masked hypertension is defined as confirmed blood pressure elevation on an ambulatory basis despite normal office blood pressure measurements. + Patients with chronic kidney disease have an increased incidence of masked hypertension. + Masked hypertension is associated with increased prevalence of target organ damage and increase in left ventricular mass.

His arterial blood gas maps to metabolic acidosis on the acid-base nomogram. His anion gap (139 - (98+ 15) = 26 mEQ/L is elevated. The normal anion gap is 8 to 12 mEQ/L. There are a number of mnemonic devices for remembering the causes of high anion gap acidosis. As described in Mehta, et al, one of the most popular is GOLDMARK. G—Glycols (propylene, diethylene, or ethylene glycol) O—Oxoproline (metabolite of acetaminophen overdose) L—L-Lactate (usual lactic acid produced by tissues) D—D-Lactate (lactic acid produced by gut bacteria) M—Methanol (or other alcohol) A—Aspirin R—Renal failure K—Ketones (starvation, diabetes, alcoholic) Missing in this list are the organic academias resulting from inborn errors of metabolism (methylmalonic and propionic acidemia), but these conditions usually present with ketosis. In the setting of an elevated anion gap, evaluating whether a plasma osmolar gap is present can be helpful. Calculated osmolality is calculated using the equation 2(Na+K) + glucose/18 + urea nitrogen/2.8. Sodium and potassium are expressed as milliequivalent per liter and glucose and urea nitrogen as milligrams per deciliter. In the patient in the vignette, the calculated osmolality is 2(135+5.9) + 140/18 + 70/2.8 = 314.6 mOsm/kg. The osmolar gap is the difference between the calculated and measured osmolality. In this case, the osmolar gap is 355 - 314.6 = 40.4 mOsm/kg. Normal osmolar gap is 10 mOsm/kg. A number of clinical scenarios can cause a moderately elevated osmolar gap (< 20 mOsm/kg) such as renal failure, ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, and lactic acidosis. An osmolar gap of more than 20 mOsm/kg usually indicates a toxic alcohol poisoning (methanol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or ethylene glycol). This is important because there are antidotes to slow the metabolism of these toxic alcohols. Fomepizole, a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase can be used. Alternatively, ethanol can be used but is a less effective inhibitor. Dialysis may be indicated in cases of severe acid-base disorders, severe toxic levels, or end organ dysfunction. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/february?req=201908241007512402... 8/24/2019 February | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 6 In this vignette, the grandmother brought a cough remedy contaminated with diethylene glycol from her native country. There have been over a dozen outbreaks of poisoning of children due to the manufacture of medicine with diethylene glycol carrier (acetaminophen syrup from Haiti, cough medicine from India, and silver sulfadiazine from Spain). In the United States in 1937, sulfanilamide elixir was prepared with diethylene glycol, which led to the deaths of more than 100 people. In response, the US Congress passed the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that required manufacturers to show that a drug was safe before it could be marketed. Interestingly, early after toxic alcohol ingestion, the osmolar gap will be increased (because of the presence of toxic alcohols), but the anion gap will be minimally elevated. As the toxic alcohol is metabolized, the osmolar gap narrows and the anion gap increases. In 1 series of adult patients receiving continuous lorazepam infusion with propylene glycol carrier, the average anion gap was 16 mEq/L with an osmolar gap of 48 mOsm/kg. Reye syndrome is an acute encephalopathy with liver failure. Liver enzymes are usually markedly elevated with coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, acute kidney injury, and metabolic acidosis. A grossly elevated osmolar gap would not be expected unless fulminant liver failure and lactic acidosis develops. Ibuprofen overdose can present with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain in part related to cyclooxygenase inhibition and subsequent effects on gastrointestinal mucosal. Other symptoms may include central nervous system effects (headache, tinnitus, and drowsiness). Renal blood flow is also affected and acute kidney injury may occur. In large overdoses, symptoms become more severe (seizures, coma, hypotension, hypothermia) and may include metabolic acidosis (no significant osmolar gap expected). Patients with chronic renal failure are expected to have metabolic acidosis (because of lack of renal ammoniagenesis and build-up of acids) leading to a slightly elevated anion gap. In addition, some accumulation of osmotically active substances may also occur, leading to a mildly increased osmolar gap. In this case, there is no suggestion of chronic renal failure and the anion and osmolar gap are too severe to be explained by chronic renal failure. As opposed to the high anion gap acidosis with multiple causes (anions), a normal anion gap acidosis is caused by a relative excess of chloride compared with bicarbonate. This can be because of excessive chloride administration with normal saline, hydrochloric acid intoxication, and even chlorine gas intoxication. A relative http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/february?req=201908241007512402... 8/24/2019 February | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 5 of 6 excess of chloride could also occur because of the loss of bicarbonate through the gastrointestinal tract due to diarrhea, fistulas, urinary diversion with intestinal components, and cholestyramine. There can also be renal loss of bicarbonate due to proximal or distal renal tubular acidosis or hypoaldosteronism. A popular mnemonic for the potential causes is USED CARP U—Ureteroenterostomy S—Small bowel fistula E—Excess chloride D—Diarrhea C—Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors A—Adrenal insufficiency R—Renal tubular acidosis P—Pancreatic fistula PREP Pearls + Evaluating a metabolic acidosis begins with determining the anion gap. + Ina high gap metabolic acidosis, the presence of a high osmolar gap (> 20 mOsm/kg) can indicate a toxic alcohol poisoning. + In normal gap acidosis, there is a relative excess of chloride due to excess chloride intake or loss of bicarbonate via the gastrointestinal tract or kidneys.

Both genetic and environmental factors can contribute to abnormal renal development. + Renal aplasia occurs when the ureteric bud fails to reach the metanephric mesenchyme (Figure). * Renal dysplasia results from abnormal metanephric differentiation. + Renal hypoplasia occurs when ureteric branching is impaired, leading to abnormally small kidneys with normal morphology and reduced nephron number. Renal dysplasia may occur in as many as 1 in 1,000 births. Renal dysplasia may manifest as multicystic dysplastic kidneys (MCDK) and also as cystic dysplasia. Multicystic dysplastic kidneys are nonfunctional with only cystic tissue (no normal nephrons) and an atretic ureter, whereas cystic dysplasia may have areas of functional nephrons. Multicystic dysplastic kidneys are typically unilateral (bilateral MCDK, like bilateral renal agenesis, may lead to fetal or infant death). Focal and segmental forms of renal dysplasia or renal hypoplasia have also been described. Renal dysplasia and hypoplasia are diagnosed on prenatal ultrasonography or postnatal imaging performed for urinary tract infection, hypertension, or other reasons. Hypoplastic kidneys are small whereas dysplastic kidney size is variable; the 2 differ histologically (Figure). * Renal hypoplasia is likely if renal size is 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and if no scarring is evident on technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Ultrasonography shows MCDK as multiple hypoechoic cysts with minimal parenchyma around the cysts. Occasionally an obstructed kidney can resemble the appearance of MCDK on ultrasonography. Cystic dysplastic kidneys will often have a few cysts visible on ultrasonography. An isotope renal scan helps distinguish between cystic dysplasia and MCDK. Typically MCDK exhibits no function (no perfusion) while cystic dysplastic kidneys will exhibit some (usually decreased) function. http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/february?req=201908241008235818 8/24/2019 February | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 Bilateral cystic renal dysplasia (especially if there are other kidney/urinary tract anomalies) may be associated with electrolyte abnormalities (eg, polyuria, salt or water wasting, hyperkalemia, renal tubular acidosis). Hydration needs to be maintained in polyuric patients, and they are more prone to dehydration due to illness. Salt and water supplementation may improve growth in those with salt and water wasting. Alkali treatment and potassium restriction may be needed for those with renal tubular acidosis and hyperkalemia, respectively. In some cases, unilateral renal dysplasia may be associated with hypertension or have associated reflux with recurrent febrile urinary tract infections. This rarely may be an indication for nephrectomy. For unilateral dysplasia, many nephrologists monitor the contralateral kidney with serial ultrasonography for compensatory renal hypertrophy. Renal dysplasia and hypoplasia may be associated with other renal or urinary tract abnormalities, including vesicoureteral reflux and urinary tract obstruction. In some cases, voiding cystourethrogram or Mag3 renal scanning may be indicated as well as consultation with a pediatric urologist. In addition, both dysplasia and hypoplasia may occur as a component of genetic syndromes (eg, branchio-oto-renal syndrome). Genetic evaluation to facilitate detection of extrarenal manifestations (eg, eye, ear) may be helpful. Prognosis in renal dysplasia and hypoplasia depends on whether it is bilateral, unilateral, or associated with other abnormalities. Patients with unilateral renal dysplasia/hypoplasia may develop hypertension. As indicated before, bilateral renal dysplasia (bilateral MCDK) can result in Potter syndrome with impaired pulmonary development in the fetus, leading to fetal or neonatal death. Patients with bilateral cystic dysplasia (with some functioning tissue) may have chronic kidney disease. Follow-up often includes monitoring the patient's renal function, blood pressure, and for proteinuria. Sometimes these patients may have normal glomerular filtration rate in infancy and/or early childhood, but over time their renal function declines, as their somatic growth exceeds the capacity of the limited number of functional nephrons. Similarly, in those with bilateral hypoplasia the renal function may initially be normal, but falls behind as the child grows with no proportionate growth in renal size, ultimately causing ESKD.

      "struvite The presence of crystals in the urine can be secondary to a number of different factors and specific to the type of crystal formed. In general, higher urinary concentration will promote urinary crystallization as well as underlying pathologies that are associated with increased urinary concentration of crystal components. The spectrum of pH will promote various crystals. To remember the pH that promotes crystal formation, one can use the following mnemonic: Can U Order a Stone Panel? http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/march?req=201908241027027204&... 8/24/2019 March | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 4 The numbers on the scale refer to the pH and capital letters in the mnemonic correspond to the following crystals: Can (cystine) U (uric acid) Order (oxalate) Stone (struvite) Panel (phosphate) Low pH favors cystine and uric acid crystal formation. Urinary pH does not seem to influence calcium oxalate crystal formation, thus it is set as the neutral point on the scale. However, low urine pH is associated with hypocitraturia, which favors calcium oxalate crystal formation. High pH favors struvite and calcium phosphate crystallization. High urine pH is also associated with increased urine citrate levels, which lowers the risk of calcium oxalate crystallization. Finally, the concentration/quantity of inhibitors of crystallization also influences crystal formation. Factors that promote each type of urinary crystal formation are reviewed in detail below. Cystine crystals are usually found exclusively in patients with cystinuria. A number of gene defects have been found associated with cystinuria, and all ultimately result in increased urinary cystine levels. An acidic urinary pH promotes urinary cystine crystallization. Thus, treatment, in addition to hydration, should be aimed at alkalinizing the urine. Because cystine is a homodimer of 2 cysteine molecules linked with a disulfide bond, thiol- containing medications such as tiopronin and penicillamine can reduce this disulfide bond and reduce urinary cystine levels to limit crystallization. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/march?req=201908241027027204&... 8/24/2019 March | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 Uric acid crystals form when soluble urate and hydrogen ions combine to form insoluble uric acid. A high urine concentration of uric acid and low urinary pH promote urinary uric acid crystallization because both positively influence the reaction, leading to the formation of uric acid. Calcium oxalate crystal formation is largely dependent on the supersaturation of calcium oxalate. A number of different factors can lead to increased calcium and/or oxalate concentrations in the urine. These factors can include systemic increases in serum calcium or oxalate levels and subsequent increased filtered loads of calcium and/or oxalate. Alternatively, abnormal tubular reabsorption of calcium or oxalate can result in increases in urinary concentration. Finally, increased urine sodium results in increased urine calcium excretion, thus other metabolic factors may physiologically increase calcium oxalate levels in the urine. Urinary citrate acts as a natural calcium oxalate crystal inhibitor, so hypocitraturia can result in increased calcium oxalate crystallization. Little evidence exists to suggest that urinary PH affects calcium oxalate crystallization. Struvite crystals (also known as “magnesium ammonium phosphate crystals”) are formed by urease-producing organisms. Typically Proteus species produce an enzyme, urease, that breaks down urinary urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. Ammonia then combines with a hydrogen ion from water to create ammonium ions and hydroxide, leading to urinary alkalinization. Crystal formation is directly linked to the presence of the urease-producing organism. The presence of an infected stone or upper urinary tract infection with such organisms will promote struvite crystal formation. Metabolic factors and urinary chemistries are not contributing factors to crystal formation. Calcium phosphate crystal formation is very similar to calcium oxalate crystal formation, with 2 important differences. First, an alkaline urine promotes calcium phosphate crystallization. Second, and perhaps obviously, high urine calcium phosphate supersaturation leads to calcium phosphate crystallization. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/march?req=201908241027027204&... 8/24/2019 March | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 4 In this patient with low urinary pH, all of the answer choices except cystine crystals are either pH independent (calcium oxalate) or associated with alkaline urine (calcium phosphate and struvite).

Renal injuries are classified based on CT appearance as defined by the revised American Association for Surgery of Trauma classification scheme (Table). http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/march?req=201908241027465358&... 8/24/2019 March | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 4 For stable children with mild blunt abdominal trauma and less than 50 red blood cells per high-power field, some guidelines allow for ultrasonography rather than CT scan. Children have an increased number of risk factors for renal injuries after abdominal trauma compared with adults. The kidneys are relatively larger, may extend further below the rib cage, and may be more mobile. In addition, the ribs are more flexible, children tend to have less surrounding perirenal fat, and younger children may still have renal lobulations, which may predispose the kidneys to fracture. This patient has cross-fused ectopia which may predispose him to injury. Other predisposing conditions for renal injury may include hydronephrosis, cystic kidney disease, renal tumors, or ectopic kidneys. Most renal trauma in children is related to blunt forces. This is different in adults who often have penetrating wounds from stabbing or shootings. In many children with blunt renal injuries, other organs are affected. The most common injuries are thoracic injury, followed by injuries of the head, extremities, pelvis, and spine. Symptoms of renal injury include abdominal tenderness or distention, bruising of the lateral abdomen, palpable mass, fractured ribs, or gross hematuria. Hemodynamic instability or shock in the pediatric patient is a very late manifestation of renal injury. Patients can have severe renal trauma without hematuria. Patients with grade 4 or grade 5 injuries can have normal urinalysis. In a recent study, 17% of the grade 4 injuries had normal urinalysis findings. In another study, 24% of the patients with renal artery occlusions had normal urinalysis findings. Most pediatric renal injury is managed conservatively without operative procedures. With significant renal trauma the nephrectomy rate is typically below 3%. The long-term sequelae of renal trauma includes hypertension. This is thought to be mediated by increased activity of the renin angiotensin system due to areas of tissue with compromised blood supply, though the evidence is mostly http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/march?req=201908241027465358&... 8/24/2019 March | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 theoretical. In a recent, large, single-center series from Salt Lake City, of 62 children admitted with high-grade (III-IV) renal injuries, 4 were hypertensive at discharge (6.5%). Of these patients, 38 were followed for an average of 4 years. None of the patients who were normotensive at the time of discharge developed hypertension. Two of 4 hypertensive patients discontinued their antihypertensive medication. For the patient in this vignette, CT would be required before returning to participation. His cross-fused ectopia itself would not prevent him from participating especially if additional shielding was provided. Whether he could continue to participate would be dependent on the degree of renal injury by CT scan, and whether he has recurrent renal injury. Depending on CT scan results, a consultation with a pediatric urologist is warranted. Monitoring for gross hematuria, persistent microscopic hematuria, or hypertension would be important.

The differential diagnosis for this combination might include acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease; however, her serum creatinine concentration is normal, and together with normal urinalysis with microscopy findings, normal renal ultrasound findings, and no historical exposures suggestive of kidney disease, alternative and less common etiologies need to be considered. Given the family history of early-onset hypertension, a hereditary renal tubular mechanism leading to sodium retention and impaired potassium excretion (urine potassium <30 mEq/L) could be the etiology. This is further supported by the patient's low plasma renin activity. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2, also known as “Gordon syndrome,” is a hereditary disorder that affects the distal convoluted tubule sodium-chloride cotransporter and collecting duct potassium channels. It may be caused by loss-of-function mutation of the WNK kinase 4, gain-of-function mutation of the WNK kinase 1, or mutations in KLHL3 and CUL3 genes that encode regulators of the WNK kinases, leading to overexpression of the sodium- chloride cotransporter and underexpression of collecting duct potassium channels. These abnormalities lead to enhanced sodium chloride reabsorption and impaired potassium excretion. The enhanced sodium retention leads to elevated blood pressure and suppression of renin, and an “inappropriately” low-normal aldosterone level, given the degree of hyperkalemia. In addition to the impaired potassium secretion, collecting duct acid secretion is often mildly impaired, consistent with a type 4 renal tubular acidosis. The sodium retention also leads to a compensatory decrease in sodium reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule and ascending limb of the loop of Henle, both leading to decreased calcium reabsorption from those nephron segments, resulting in hypercalciuria. Treatment of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 would include a low sodium and low potassium diet, but the mainstay of therapy for this condition is a thiazide diuretic. Such distal convoluted tubule diuretics directly target the pathophysiology of the condition, the overexpressed sodium chloride cotransporter. Through inhibition of sodium chloride reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule, the increased delivery of sodium chloride to the collecting duct will also enhance collecting duct potassium excretion, http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/march?req=201908241028352244&... 8/24/2019 March | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 3 assisting with the other aspect of this condition’s pathophysiology. A loop diuretic may assist in treating this patient's hypertension and hyperkalemia, but it will not target the pathophysiology directly and will aggravate the hypercalciuria already present in pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2. Mineralocorticoid supplementation might assist with the hyperkalemia and increase collecting duct potassium secretion, but it would worsen this patient's elevated blood pressure. PREP Pearls + In patients with hyperkalemia and hypertension with normal renal function and findings otherwise, consider hereditary renal tubular dysfunction as the etiology. + Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 is caused by overexpression of the sodium chloride cotransporter of the distal convoluted tubule, resulting in sodium retention and hypertension, and decreased expression of the potassium channels of the collecting duct, leading to hyperkalemia. + Thiazide diuretics provide the most targeted and effective treatment for pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2.

On T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI - shown in Figure), the lesion is hypointense, which suggests fibrotic elements. On T1 imaging (not shown), the same lesion was hyperintense relative to the rest of the field, confirming that fat is also present within the lesion. Fat-suppressed T1 http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/march?req=201908241029126939&... 8/24/2019 March | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 4 images revealed marked signal drop-out, indicating the predominance of fat or adipose tissue. Overall, this pattern and this location are diagnostic of the lesion being a renal angiomyolipoma (AML). Angiomyolipomas are benign sporadic mesenchymal origin tumors comprising dysmorphic blood vessels, smooth muscle spindle cells, and mature adipose tissue. AMLs derive from perivascular epithelioid cells, and therefore fall within the family called perivascular epithelioid cell(PECOMA) tumors. Malignancy is rare and is suggested by a size greater than 7 cm, tumor necrosis, or epithelioid carcinoma-like pattern on histology. Renal AMLs occur uncommonly in the general population, with published rates of 0.22% in women and 0.1% in men, and tend to occur in people in the fourth and fifth decades of life. About 20% of AMLs are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In the presence of TSC, renal AMLs can be seen in 55% to 90% of patients. TSC itself is an autosomal dominant or sporadic mutation genetic disease, with a prevalence of 1 in 12,000. TSC is associated with “tubers” in many other organs, including the brain, such that neurologic problems are common. The genes known to be affected in TSC are TSC1 (encoding hamartin) located on chromosome 9q34 and TSC2 (encoding tuberin), located on 16p13.3. AMLs are also seen in 30% to 50% of patients with an even more rare condition called sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. With increased use of imaging in modern times, 80% of AMLs are now discovered incidentally. In older series, any of the classic symptom triad of flank pain, palpable mass, and hematuria were noted in 11% to 41% of patients. Pain and hematuria are still common, seen in 50% and 22% in recent cohorts. Sporadic AMLs tend to be unilateral, single, and smaller (1-4 cm size) than TSC-AMLs, which are more likely to be bilateral, multifocal, and larger (3.5-19.3 cm size). The diagnosis of AML is made mostly with CT or MRI. The presence of fat within a lesion arising from the kidney is the key diagnostic finding. Rarely, fat-poor AMLs can present a diagnostic challenge that can be addressed with specialized MRI techniques. Renal ultrasonography will also show a http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/march?req=201908241029126939&... 8/24/2019 March | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 hyperechoic lesion because of the fat presence, but diagnostic reliability of ultrasonography is not as high as CT or MRI. However, once diagnosed, ultrasonography can be used to follow the lesion. Most sporadic AMLs can be managed conservatively, because they tend to be smaller and grow at a slower rate than TSC-AMLs. The criteria for intervention in sporadic AMLs include symptomatic lesions greater than 4 cm, suspected malignancy, or presence in women of childbearing age. Options for treatment of sporadic AMLs are selective arterial embolization, cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, partial nephrectomy, or radical nephrectomy. In patients with TSC, a growing body of literature has documented efficacy of the mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) inhibitors sirolimus or everolimus in reducing the size of the lesion(s). In particular, everolimus carries a Food and Drug Administration-approved indication for TSC-AML, based on results from the randomized EXIST-2 trial. These drugs can cause stomatitis, hyperlipidemia, and nasopharyngitis. The 12-year-old girl in the vignette presented with pain and has a single AML on CT and MRI. The size of the AML is not mentioned but the lesion appears small. Of the management options listed, a nephrostomy tube (eg, for hydronephrosis from an obstructing stone) or chemotherapy (eg for Wilms tumor) are not supported by the imaging characteristics. Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor, not an mTOR inhibitor, and is not indicated for this situation.

The most likely of the differential diagnoses would be postinfectious GN or lupus nephritis (Table). For either of these, the histologic findings would likely include focal or global proliferative GN (for proliferative GN appearance, see Figure 1). Thus, endothelial and mesangial proliferation is the preferred response. Collagen sclerosis across the middle of 2 glomeruli would be a finding consistent with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which is not associated with changes in serum complement. Thin glomerular capillary loops with 3 mesangial cells per capillary loop would be a finding of a normal glomerulus. Thickened and prominent capillary loops with 3 mesangial cells per capillary loop (normal, NOT increased cellularity) would be a finding in membranous nephropathy. Given the mild proteinuria (subnephrotic) and evidence of GN (hypertension, hematuria), a finding of isolated membranous nephropathy is less likely than a http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/march?req=201908241022228524&... 8/24/2019 March | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 proliferative lesion in this patient. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) would also be a possible diagnosis for this patient. Typically MPGN is characterized by enlarged mesangium with capillary wall thickening with double contours, which was not one of the options. Activation of either the classic or alternative complement system can result in hypocomplementemia (Figure 2). + In lupus nephritis, immune complex binding of C1q leads to cleavage of C4 and C2 and activates the classic complement pathway. Classic complement pathway activation typically results in consumption of both complement components C3 and C4. The focal or global proliferative lesions seen with class 3 or 4 lupus nephritis are driven by classic complement activation and are associated with low C3 and C4. It can take 2 months or longer for serum complement levels to normalize during treatment of lupus nephritis. Of the 2, C3 levels may be more reliable indicators of lupus nephritis activity. In postinfectious GN, antibody-antigen complexes activate the classic complement pathways. In the acute phase, C3 is typically low, whereas C4 may be normal or low. The classic histologic finding is a diffuse proliferative GN with neutrophils. ‘Membranoproliferative’ is a descriptive term for the histologic finding of enlarged mesangium with capillary wall thickening with double contours. Membranoproliferative GNs can be secondary to immune-complex mediated disease (classic complement activation), in which case C3 and C4 are often both decreased. These may occur secondary to infections such as hepatitis B or C. Membranoproliferative GN lesions can also be seen with C3 glomerulopathies, where alternative complement is activated. In addition to MPGN-like lesions, histologic findings of mesangial proliferation with expanded mesangium and mesangial hypercellularity may occur in C3 glomerulopathy. Under the new classification system, “C3 glomerulopathies” include cases with findings of MPGN type 1, 2, or 3 on histology and electron microscopy (including those previously classified as dense deposit disease) where immunofluorescence is positive predominantly for C3. Low C3 with normal C4 is typical for C3 glomerulopathy. The alternative complement pathway is activated by a constant “tick over” of C3 cleavage to C3b on the surface of endothelial and other cells. In healthy people, alternative complement activation is inhibited by multiple mechanisms, including factors H and | (Figure 2). C3 nephritic factor, an antibody that binds and stabilizes the activated C3 convertase (C3bBb), contributes to persistent alternative complement activation in many cases of C3 glomerulopathy. Other defects in the regulation of the alternative complement pathway (such as factor H deficiency) may also lead to C3 http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/march?req=201908241022228524&... 8/24/2019 March | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 glomerulopathy. Alternative complement activation most often leads to consumption of complement component C3, with normal C4. Low C3 and/or C4 can also occur because of decreased synthesis of these components. C4 is encoded by 2 loci, and “null” variants (where C4 is not expressed) are common; partial C4 deficiency may predispose patients to autoimmune diseases, including lupus. Other conditions have been associated with hypocomplementemia but do not typically involve renal disease. These include burns, cardiopulmonary bypass, drug reactions and hypersensitivities, hemodialysis with cellulose (cuprophane) dialysis membranes (no longer used), hepatic failure, infections (malaria hemolytic crisis, viral infections), malignancies and chemotherapy (eg, Hodgkin lymphoma treatment), malnutrition, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, porphyria, rheumatoid arthritis, serum sickness, thromboembolism, thyroid disease (Graves), severe sepsis.

In general, there are 3 classes of amino acid transporters specific for neutral, acidic, and basic amino acids. + The neutral amino acids leucine, isoleucine, alanine, tryptophan, serine, phenylalanine, glutamine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are transported by SLC6A19 expressed in the brush border membrane of proximal tubule. Mutations in this transporter cause Hartnup disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that presents clinically with neurologic deficit, cerebellar ataxia, and failure to thrive. * The acidic amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, are transported in the proximal tubule in an electrogenic manner by the high-affinity SLC1A1 transporter. Mutations in SLC1A1 cause dicarboxylic aminoaciduria and intellectual disability. * The basic amino acids, lysine and arginine, share the same transporter as cystine called rBAT encoded by the SLC3A7 gene expressed predominantly in the $3 segment of the proximal tubule. Mutations in SLC3A7 cause type 1 cystinuria as well as dibasic aminoaciduria. Brush border membrane vesicle studies in various animal species have shown that SLC6A79, SLCIA7, and SLC3A7 gene expression is developmentally regulated, and lower in premature than newborn animals with further upregulation postnatally into adulthood. Thus, term neonates have generalized (physiologic) aminoaciduria that is more pronounced in premature infants. The neonate in the vignette has generalized aminoaciduria and glucosuria, likely due to prematurity and relatively lower expression of the proximal tubular glucose and amino acid transporters. Therefore, reevaluation of urinary amino acid profile in 4 to 8 weeks is recommended. In Hartnup disease and cystinosis, the initial urinary amino acid profiles reflect the class of amino acid transporters affected and are thus more restricted. Protein supplementation is likely to aggravate the existing metabolic acidosis by presenting additional metabolic load and is therefore not recommended. The metabolic acidosis in this infant is unlikely to be the result of amino acid transport defects and warrants further investigation. In addition to amino acid transporters, the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule expresses at least 5 organic acid transporters (OATs). These OATs serve to transport poorly filtered highly protein-bound substrates such as autacoids (eg, prostaglandins), drugs (penicillins, probenecid, nonsteroidal http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/march?req=20 190824 1030087420 8/24/2019 March | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 anti-inflammatory drugs, among others), uric acid, and para-aminohippurate (PAH) from the blood (basolateral side) into the proximal tubule cell for eventual secretion into the urinary space via the luminal multidrug resistance protein family. Because PAH is completely cleared from the blood and secreted into the filtrate, PAH clearance is used to estimate renal plasma flow. Studies in humans have demonstrated that PAH clearance reaches adult values by age 2 years. Ontogeny studies have shown that OAT1 and OAT2 are the major developmentally regulated OATs in mammalian proximal tubules.

The child in the vignette has stage II hypertension and a solitary kidney, without any other abnormalities noted on evaluation. Individuals with a solitary kidney are at increased risk for the development of hypertension. Westland et al demonstrated in a meta-analysis that 16% of individuals with congenital unilateral renal agenesis ultimately developed hypertension. There are several possible causes for this increased risk of hypertension in those with a single functioning kidney. One potential explanation is that individuals with 1 kidney have 50% fewer nephrons than those with 2 functioning kidneys. This diminished nephron endowment leads to an increase in single nephron glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The increased glomerular blood flow and pressure that allows for this increase in GFR leads to compensatory hypertrophy, with overall GFR increasing to approximately 70% of what one might expect with 2 functional kidneys. However, over time this hyperfiltration can lead to glomerular scarring and loss, elevating the risk for hypertension and progressive chronic kidney disease. Another postulated mechanism by which a solitary kidney is thought to lead to hypertension is related to disordered sodium homeostasis. This is best explained by the Goldblatt kidney experimental models of renovascular hypertension. In the 1-clip 2-kidney Goldblatt hypertension model, there are 2 functioning kidneys, 1 of which has decreased perfusion and is ischemic. This ischemic kidney excretes high levels of renin, leading to systemic hypertension. In response to this increase in blood pressure, the urinary excretion of sodium in the contralateral, nonischemic kidney is increased via pressure natriuresis, resulting in sodium homeostasis. This is in contrast to the 1-clip 1-kidney Goldblatt hypertension model, where there is a solitary kidney. In this model, with a unilateral ischemic kidney, renin is elevated and systemic hypertension results. However, there is no opportunity for pressure natriuresis to occur; sodium retention and intravascular volume expansion results, further increasing blood pressure. In both of these models, the efferent arteriole is vasoconstricted in the ischemic kidney to maintain glomerular blood flow and GFR. It follows that when the efferent arteriole is dilated, as occurs with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/april?req=201908241056555948&st... 8/24/2019 April | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 angiotensin Il receptor blockade, GFR in that kidney will decrease. In the case of the solitary kidney (1-clip 1-kidney model), this can lead to substantial increases in serum creatinine and potassium. Although the 1-clip 1-kidney model closely resembles unilateral renovascular hypertension, not all hypertension with an associated solitary kidney will have a dramatic decrease in GFR with initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). In fact, treatment of hypertension with an agent that will also decrease glomerular capillary hypertension is preferred in individuals with solitary functioning kidneys because of the added benefit of renal protection afforded by the prevention of glomerular injury and progressive renal dysfunction. For this reason, ACEi and ARBs are often preferred. By preferentially dilating the efferent arteriole, the glomerular capillary pressure is decreased and GFR declines, decreasing hyperfiltration and the associated injury that can occur. This can be observed clinically as a decline in proteinuria. Occasionally, particularly with solitary kidneys and with renal artery stenosis, GFR declines significantly after initiation of ACEi or ARB, leading to a significant increase in serum creatinine and serum potassium. For this reason, close laboratory monitoring is essential after initiating or increasing the dose of one of these agents. Some children with a solitary kidney and substantial hypertension may have a small, remnant kidney not easily visualized on routine ultrasonography. This should be considered when hypertension is difficult to control, and alternate imaging should be pursued. In this scenario, when there is a small remnant kidney with less than 10% function, nephrectomy may be warranted for improvement in blood pressure control. In the vignette, antihypertensive therapy is warranted because of the degree of blood pressure elevation and presence of a solitary kidney. Of the available choices, lisinopril would be most appropriate as an initial agent because of its ability to target the underlying etiology and also provide renal protection. Lisinopril (and other ACEi and ARBs) would require laboratory monitoring in this child to screen for the development of hyperkalemia and increased serum creatinine. Cough (ACEi) and angioedema (ACEi and ARB) are other known side effects and should be discussed with the family before http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/april?req=201908241056555948&st... 8/24/2019 April | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 initiation, as should their teratogenic potential when treating a female patient. ACEi and ARBs are contraindicated in aortic stenosis and pregnancy, and require dose adjustment in renal insufficiency. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that is generally very well tolerated. It may cause tachycardia and peripheral edema but otherwise does not require intensive laboratory monitoring after medication initiation. Clonidine is an a-adrenergic agonist that lowers blood pressure by decreasing central sympathetic outflow. Common side effects include somnolence and dry mouth but there are no laboratory abnormalities that require monitoring. Labetalol is an a and B blocker. This class of medications may have a negative impact on athletic performance and its effect on heart rate can be dose-limiting. They are also contraindicated in patients with asthma, heart failure, heart block, and pulmonary edema, and should be avoided in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Several side effects have been described, including hyperkalemia, hepatotoxicity, bronchospasm, heart failure, hypo- or hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. Importantly, abrupt discontinuation of this class of medication and of clonidine can lead to rebound hypertension. The child in the vignette has a solitary kidney. Of the available agents, treatment with lisinopril would require the most laboratory monitoring after initiation compared with the other antihypertensive choices provided. PREP Pearls + Individuals with a solitary kidney are at increased risk for hypertension and progressive chronic kidney disease. + Antihypertensive therapy that targets glomerular capillary hypertension (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) are preferred for their efficacy and ability to provide renal protection.

      "Figure D. The boy in the vignette meets many criteria to be at high risk for an acute cellular or antibody-mediated rejection of his kidney transplant. He has a rising serum creatinine concentration that does not correct after hydration, is not associated with urinary tract obstruction, and is associated with a low tacrolimus level and self-admitted missed doses. The features on kidney transplant biopsy that diagnose acute cellular rejection and other conditions were first defined by a group of pathologists at a meeting in Banff, Canada, in 1991, and have since been revised several times. The most recent full version of kidney transplant rejection criteria was published in 2007 (Table 1), with an update to the antibody- mediated component in 2013 (Table 2). Acute cellular rejection is a process characterized by a recognition of foreign antigens by antigen-presenting cells and T cells, then leading to infiltration of the allograft by macrophages and lymphocytes. This infiltration occurs most commonly in renal interstitium, into the basolateral aspects of the renal tubular epithelium, and in more severe cases, into the arterial wall. These lesions are therefore labelled as “i, t, and v.” Glomerular inflammation is rare in cellular rejection and is considered a sign of antibody-mediated rejection, though some overlap may occur. The letters are also associated with a subsequent number such as 1 or 2, indicating less than 25% or more than 25% of the parenchymal area affected. In the Banff schema, category IV is acute cellular-mediated rejection. This category is further stratified into grades |, Il, or Ill based on the presence of necrosis (grade III), arteritis (grade II), or limited to tubulitis/interstitial inflammation (grade I). Grades | and II can be substratified http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/april?req=201908241057563598&st... 8/24/2019 April | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 4 into A or B depending on the amount of parenchymal area affected. It should be noted that the diagnosis of acute cellular rejection does not exclude the possibility of concomitant antibody-mediated rejection. Figure A, the preferred response choice, shows significant numbers of lymphocytes (cells with dark blue dense nuclei) infiltrating into renal tubules through the tubular basement membrane (tubulitis), with accompanying interstitial inflammation. Figure B shows thickened capillary wall loops in the periphery of the glomerular tuft, which would suggest a transplant glomerulopathy, a form of chronic antibody-mediated rejection. Figure C shows some viral inclusion bodies in the deeper renal medulla, typical of BK virus nephropathy. Figure D shows nodular glomerulosclerosis, a finding most often seen in advanced diabetic nephropathy (the classic Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules).

Part of this syndrome is the development of nephrotic syndrome during infancy or childhood (usually about 3 months). Disorganized glomeruli with abnormalities of basement membrane are typically identified by kidney biopsy. This is likely the cause of the increased echogenicity. Overall, a large number of processes can cause increased echogenicity and/or cystic changes in the renal parenchyma on ultrasonography (Table). These may be associated with small, normal-sized, or large kidneys. In adults, the kidneys should be less echogenic than the liver, spleen, or pancreas. In newborns and during the first 6 months of age, the kidney cortex may have echogenicity that is about the same or greater than the liver or spleen. On ultrasonography, it should be recognized that echogenicity relates to the physical property of the kidneys or tissue. Echogenicity is seen when there are tissues or substances with differences in acoustic reflectance (ability to reflect ultrasound waves). Bones, fat, and tendons are typically hyperechoic. In chronic kidney disease, a relative or absolute increase in collagen content may contribute to the increased echogenicity usually seen. Other processes that lead to scarring or collagen deposition, such as pyelonephritis, are not well detected on ultrasonography. In autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, the microscopic cysts lead to increased echogenicity along with large kidneys. In the case described in the vignette, the multiple congenital abnormalities along with the development of nephrotic syndrome makes autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease unlikely. Similarly, renal vein thrombosis may cause enlarged echogenic kidneys, which may subsequently become small echogenic kidneys due to scarring. Typically, Doppler examination would reveal abnormalities in renal vein blood flow, and many children have gross hematuria. The dysmorphic findings would not be expected. Glomerulocystic kidney disease appears on ultrasonography as enlarged echogenic kidneys with small subcortical cysts.

In addition, 20% of individuals with nephronophthisis develop extrarenal manifestations related to ciliary dysfunction, which includes visual, http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/april?req=201908241058410624&st... 8/24/2019 April | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 4 skeletal and cardiac defects, hepatic fibrosis, and neurologic abnormalities. There are several forms of nephronophthisis - infantile, juvenile, and adolescent - which are associated with the development of ESRD at increasing ages (median age at ESRD: 1 year, 13 years, and 19 years for infantile, juvenile, and adolescent forms, respectively). Based on her clinical presentation and age at diagnosis, the child in the vignette has juvenile nephronophthisis, which typically progresses to ESRD by 13 years of age. Although many genes have been associated with nephronophthisis, histologically this condition is characterized by thickened renal tubular basement membranes, renal tubular atrophy, sclerosing tubulointerstitial nephropathy, and corticomedullary cyst formation. These abnormalities lead to a diminished ability to maximally concentrate the urine and reabsorb sodium. As a result, children often develop polyuria, polydipsia, and secondary enuresis. They are often relatively volume depleted, which explains why most children are normotensive and why many can become dehydrated with decreased fluid and/or sodium intake. The chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis leads to the classic “bland urine” finding and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) that universally leads to ESRD. Nephronophthisis is divided into 3 broad categories (infantile, juvenile, adolescent) based on typical age at presentation and median age to progression to ESRD. Each of these clinical variants are associated with different gene mutations. The juvenile and adolescent variants are more common and can present with polyuria and polydipsia, often by 4 to 6 years of age in the juvenile variant and later for the adolescent variant. These forms present more typically, as mentioned before, and are associated with normal- sized to small kidneys. Acute kidney injury can occur if sodium and/or fluid intake is diminished because of the significant fixed urinary losses of fluid and sodium. Poor growth is common, particularly in the juvenile form, because of relative chronic hypovolemia, CKD, and subsequent metabolic acidosis. The most common extrarenal manifestation is tapetoretinal degeneration, a milder type of retinitis pigmentosa. The infantile form, on the other hand, is rare and has a different clinical course than the juvenile and adolescent variants. It typically presents prenatally or during early infancy with oligohydramnios, severe hypertension, and large, sometimes cystic kidneys. Renal abnormalities may be seen on fetal http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/april?req=201908241058410624&st... 8/24/2019 April | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 ultrasonography at 22 weeks. Extrarenal manifestations are much more common in the infantile form (80% of patients). This form is also histologically distinct from the juvenile and adolescent forms: cortical microcysts are present and there is an absence of medullary cysts/tubular basement membrane changes. There are no specific therapies targeting nephronophthisis. Care is typically supportive and focused on the management of CKD (fluid/electrolyte balance, maintaining normal growth, anemia treatment). As CKD progresses, hypertension and proteinuria can develop as a result of secondary glomerulosclerosis. Renal transplantation is the preferred form of renal replacement therapy in this disease. Transplantation is associated with excellent outcomes and studies suggest that outcomes in patients with nephronophthisis may be superior to those in the general pediatric ESRD population. In addition, there is no risk of disease recurrence after transplantation. Finally, there are several syndromes in which nephronophthisis is a clinical finding, and these syndromes are characterized by their varying extrarenal manifestations. These are detailed in the Table .

The elevated white blood cell count argues against a pancytopenia. The most likely renal biopsy pathology in such a patient is a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Acute tubular necrosis may accompany TMA but alone would not explain the HUS features. Lupus nephritis is possible and can present with associated thrombocytopenia and anemia, but the very young age of the patient and the nonbloody Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia co/i-negative diarrhea indicate atypical HUS. Furthermore, class IV rather than class V lupus nephritis would be expected to show such severe features. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) would also be less likely, and MPGN types 1 or 2 would be more common rather than type 3. Thrombotic microangiopathy is a pathologic description, which is clinically characterized by the triad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic nonimmune hemolytic anemia, and organ injury. If the injured organ is the kidney, then the clinical triad becomes HUS. The classification of TMAs has changed in the last 2 decades and continues to evolve. They are currently classified as inherited or acquired primary; secondary; or infection-associated TMAs (Figure 1). The primary TMA syndromes are described by evidence supporting a defined cause. Primary TMAs include hereditary or acquired causes. Mutations in ADAM7573, MMACHC (cobalamin 1c deficiency), or genes encoding complement proteins are among the hereditary causes. Antibodies to ADAM7573 or complement factor H, or drug- or Shiga toxin-induced TMAs are acquired primary causes. Thrombotic microangiopathy is also associated with various infections. In Shiga toxin HUS and pneumococcal HUS, distinct mechanisms result in TMA. In other infections, the processes are not defined, and in some cases, the infection may trigger manifestation of a primary TMA. Secondary TMAs occur in a spectrum of conditions such as bone marrow transplantation, calcineurin inhibitor use, pregnancy, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/april?req=201908241038512652&st... 8/24/2019 April | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 liver enzymes, low platelet count after pregnancy), malignancies, and malignant hypertension. In many cases, the pathogenic mechanisms are multifactorial or unknown. The clinical renal manifestations of TMAs include not only HUS but also acute kidney injury, hypertension, florid acute renal failure, and in untreated cases, leading to end-stage renal disease. The renal pathologic features of TMAs can be diverse and reflect the tissue responses to endothelial injury as described in Brocklebank V, et al doi: 10.2215/CJN.00620117. For all primary TMA syndromes, the renal vascular pathologic abnormalities observed are the same, characterized by renal arteriole occlusion with endotheliosis as well as lumen and vessel-wall fibrin. Extrarenal manifestations reported in TMAs cover many different body systems. They include: 1) neurologic involvement, including seizures and altered consciousness; 2) cerebral artery thrombosis or stenosis; 3) extracerebral artery stenosis; 4) gastrointestinal involvement (including diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain); 5) cardiac involvement/myocardial infarction; 6) pancreatitis; 7) gangrene of skin or fingers/toes; 8) ocular involvement; 9) hepatitis; and 10) pulmonary involvement. A diagnostic algorithm for the investigation and management of TMAs is shown in Figure 2 - Reprinted with permission from Brocklebank V, Wood KM, Kavanagh D.Thrombotic Microangiopathy and the Kidney. C/in/ Am Soc Nephrol. 2018 Feb 7;13(2):304. Once TMA is suspected based on the clinical HUS features, an ADAMTS level greater than 10% will rule out thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Stool testing should be performed for Shiga toxin or £ co/iand documented as negative before a diagnosis of atypical HUS is made. It is also worthwhile to draw and save blood samples from the patient before initiating therapy and transfusions. In children, eculizumab is usually the next initial therapy, whereas in adults, plasma exchange might be the initial therapy.

      "she will need to initiate renal replacement therapy by 4 years of age The child in the vignette has renal hypoplasia, as evidenced by her failure to thrive, elevated serum creatinine concentration, dilute urine without sediment, and small echogenic kidneys with loss of corticomedullary differentiation. Her history of oligohydramnios and low birthweight, and maternal history of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, also support this diagnosis. The diagnosis of renal hypoplasia is made based on history and imaging, and when bilateral, will often progress to end-stage renal disease later in childhood/early adolescence due to compensatory hypertrophy of the reduced number of nephrons and ultimate focal segmental glomerulosclerosis from glomerular hyperfiltration. Tissue specimen is not absolutely required for diagnosis. Renal hypoplasia is thought to occur via an arrest of the metanephric renal blastema between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation. This disruption in renal development occurs because of either a genetic or a perfusion defect. As a http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/april?req=201908241035381242&st... 8/24/2019 April | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 result, the fetus ends up with a significantly reduced number of nephrons (1/5 to 1/4 of normal). It is for this reason that the presence of small kidneys, often more than 2 standard deviations below average for age, is a characteristic finding of renal hypoplasia. When native kidneys of children with renal hypoplasia are removed during renal transplantation and examined, in addition to diminished number of nephrons, they demonstrate hypertrophic glomeruli (2x normal) with focal sclerosis and hyalinosis, hypertrophic tubules (4x normal length, 15x normal volume) and tubular atrophy, thickening of Bowman capsule and epithelial foot processes, and interstitial fibrosis. It is postulated that intrauterine growth restriction, maternal hyperglycemia, and maternal vitamin A deficiency contribute to the development of renal hypoplasia. The diagnosis of renal hypoplasia may be suggested in the neonatal period by the presence of pneumothoraces, feeding problems, metabolic acidosis, elevated serum creatinine, and increased sodium losses in the urine. When presenting in the first year after birth, affected children may have failure to thrive with associated poor intake and vomiting. After 1 year of age, failure to thrive, polyuria, polydipsia, proteinuria, and anemia may be presenting complaints/findings. Although reflux nephropathy is on the differential for children who present with failure to thrive and elevated creatinine, this child's lack of history of febrile illnesses, hospitalizations, hydronephrosis, and proteinuria make this diagnosis unlikely. Further, without hydronephrosis, clinically significant reflux is unlikely; antibiotic prophylaxis is therefore not indicated. Many children with bilateral renal hypoplasia will progress to end-stage renal disease. This usually occurs in late childhood/adolescence due to hyperfiltration leading to compensatory intraglomerular hypertension and hypertrophy. Over time, this results in secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Medical management with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can therefore be helpful in slowing renal progression to end-stage disease, particularly in those patients who also have proteinuria. The usual clinical course of children with renal hypoplasia includes the achievement of maximal glomerular filtration rate between 1 and 6 years of age, which remains stable until puberty. Close to or at the beginning of puberty, children/adolescents may experience a decline in renal function, which may http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/april?req=20 1908241035381242&st.... 8/24/2019 April | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 ultimately progress to end-stage renal disease. This progression may occur more quickly in children with concurrent diagnoses of solitary kidney and/or hydronephrosis and among those with proteinuria and/or recurrent urinary tract infections. Notably, affected children with oligohydramnios diagnosed prenatally tend to have the poorest outcome. Management is often supportive and focused on efforts to delay progression of kidney disease with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, early treatment of urinary tract infections, avoidance of nephrotoxins, maintenance of adequate hydration and electrolyte balance, and treatment of growth failure with recombinant human growth hormone as needed. For children with unilateral hypoplasia, management also includes serial renal ultrasonography to monitor the contralateral kidney growth, which often will develop compensatory hypertrophy. Once end-stage renal disease is manifest, the preferred form of renal replacement therapy is renal transplantation. PREP Pearls + Renal hypoplasia is characterized by small kidneys (>2 standard deviations below average for age) that can be echogenic with a loss of corticomedullary differentiation on ultrasonography. * Children with bilateral renal hypoplasia will progress to end-stage renal disease by late childhood/adolescence due to glomerular hypertrophy and hyperfiltration, which leads to secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. + Management of renal hypoplasia is often supportive and focused on efforts to delay progression to end-stage kidney disease.

      "stop indomethacin Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia resulting from the failure of the kidney to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin. Under physiologic conditions, vasopressin released by the posterior pituitary gland binds to the V2 receptor on the basal membrane of collecting duct cells, with consequent increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and insertion of aquaporin 2 water channels into the luminal membrane of principal cells, thereby increasing the urine osmolality and activating the thirst mechanism. Congenital NDI is rare and can occur in approximately 8.8 to 58 per 1 million male births, and often presents in the first year after birth. Clinical presentation includes polyuria, polydipsia, poor oral intake, irritability, and failure to thrive. Two different mutations have been reported: AVP receptor 2 gene (AVPR2 which encodes the vasopressin V2 receptor, inherited as X-linked recessive, and defects in the vasopressin-sensitive water channel aquaporin 2 gene (AQP2, inherited either as autosomal recessive or (rarely) autosomal dominant. Acquired NDI is more common, less severe, and associated with downregulation of AQP2. Etiologies include prolonged lithium treatment, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, infections, autoimmune disease, urinary http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/may?req=201908241 120506454 8/24/2019 May | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 tract obstruction, antibiotics, antifungal (amphotericin), antineoplastic, and antiviral agents. Lithium is the most common cause of acquired NDI. The mechanism includes (1) inhibition of glycogen synthase 3 beta, (2) increase in cyclooxygenase 2, and (3) reduction in adenylyl cyclase, CAMP production, and AQP2 phosphorylation leading to polyuria and NDI. There are no functional abnormalities in AQP2. The primary goal for the management of NDI is to provide access to water as long as the thirst mechanism is intact. The caloric intake is significantly reduced in infants and young children, because of intolerance to a large volume of both water and formula needed for growth. Because there is no cure for NDI, the current therapy includes amelioration of symptoms using a combination of medications. A recent study showed that to manage NDI, pediatric nephrologists prescribed thiazides (93%), amiloride (62%), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, 55%). Gastrointestinal and renal side effects are the most common reasons for not giving NSAIDs (43%). Thiazide inhibits the sodium chloride cotransporter SLC12A3 in the distal convoluted tubule, inducing mild hypovolemia, activation of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, and increase in proximal tubule sodium and water reabsorption. Hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia are known side effects of thiazides. Amiloride inhibits sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, and is often used in conjunction with thiazides to prevent hypokalemia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin improve urinary concentration by decreasing the delivery of solute to the distal tubule and reducing free water clearance. In the vignette, the patient has hypercalcemia with normokalemia and acceptable sodium levels, so decreasing thiazide dose is the best strategy for this child. Lowering amiloride may lead to hypokalemia. His increased water intake augments sodium correction without compromising weight gain. Serum creatinine is acceptable for age without gastrointestinal symptoms so indomethacin can be continued. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/may?req=20 1908241 120506454 8/24/2019 May | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 Acetazolamide is used in the treatment of lithium-induced NDI that is unresponsive to thiazide and amiloride. Studies have demonstrated that acetazolamide decreases cellular lithium content, and attenuates the following: lithium-induced downregulation of AQP2, expression of urinary prostaglandin E, and sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3. Ancillary therapy for NDI includes reduction in osmolar load by sodium restriction and reduction in protein intake. Because of polyuria, evaluation by imaging for hydronephrosis and hydroureter should be performed. Other medications under current investigation for NDI include: (1) sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor used to treat pulmonary hypertension, which increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate and apical membrane accumulation of AQP2; (2) metformin, which enhances adenosine monophosphate kinase, AQP2, and UT-A1 protein, resulting in higher urine osmolality; and (3) simvastatin, which increases expression of AQP2 by downregulating Rho GTPases and inhibits AQP2 endocytosis. AVPR2 selective antagonists (vaptans) and AVPR2 nonpeptide antagonists that circumvent the defective AVPR2 signaling and enhance AQP2 expression in the apical membrane are being evaluated.

The National Cooperative Dialysis Study established the concept of Kt/V urea—a unitless number of the volume of urea cleared ina dialysis session relative to the volume of distribution of urea in the body. Studies showed that clinical outcomes of patients receiving dialysis could be predicted when the dialysis dose was expressed as the product of dialyzer urea clearance (K) and treatment time (t), divided by the urea distribution volume (V). Urea is preferred as a marker of dialysis dose because it is the principal ap.org/script/may?req=201908241118249264&sta... 8/24/2019 http://2019.prepnephrology.cours May | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 3 constituent of nitrogenous waste and abundant in renal failure, can be easily measured, has a wide and even distribution in total body water, and a low molecular mass with good dialyzability. Dialyzer urea clearance (K) is a function of the dialyzer, mass transfer coefficient (KoA), blood flow, and dialysate flow. The efficiency of a dialyzer in removing urea, creatinine, phosphate, and vitamin B,2 is usually provided by the manufacturers in package inserts. It is important to note that the in vitro KoA values (reported in milliliters per minute) are higher than those achieved during dialysis because of limitations of blood and dialysate flow rates. At low blood flow rates (<200 mL/min), dialyzer clearance is limited by blood flow and increasing or adjusting dialysate rate or KoA does not change dialyzer urea clearance. At high blood flow rates (>400 mL/min), increasing KoA and dialysate rates will increase urea clearance. However, as blood flow rate approaches dialysate flow rate, urea clearance reaches a plateau. Therefore, it is suggested that dialysate flow rates should be 1.5 to 2 times the blood flow rate to maximize solute clearance by diffusion. Dialysate flow rate increases that are more than 2 times the blood flow rate or more than 800 mL/min do not increase urea clearance because blood flow is the limiting factor. Therefore, at current settings, the Kt/V in this patient can be improved by increasing dialyzer clearance or switching to a high-flux dialyzer. High-flux dialyzers have larger pores, allowing better middle molecule clearance, and achieve higher ultrafiltration at lower transmembrane pressures. Studies have reported improved survival benefits and their routine use is recommended by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Adequacy Workgroup. According to the KDOQI guidelines, hemodialysis prescription should aim at achieving a target single pool Kt/V of 1.4 per dialysis session for patients treated thrice weekly, with a minimum delivered single pool Kt/V of 1.2. In this patient, the prescribed Kt/V based on the current settings, with a decreased time of 3.5 hours, will be 1.2.

PREP Pearls Delivered Kt/V is less than the prescribed Kt/V, because of limitations of blood and dialysate flow rates in patients owing to access, size, and associated comorbidities. + At low blood flow rates (<200 mL/min), dialyser clearance is limited by blood flow and increasing or adjusting dialysate rate or KOA does not change dialyser urea clearance. * As blood flow rate approaches dialysate flow rate, urea clearance reaches a plateau. Therefore, it is suggested that dialysate flow rates should be 1.5 to 2 times the blood flow rate to maximize clearance of solutes by diffusion.

A diagnosis of SLE requires the presence of at least 4 of 11 diagnostic criteria (Table) either simultaneously or serially. In http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/may?req=201908241116167699&sta... 8/24/2019 May | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 3 the patient in the vignette, thrombocytopenia would confirm the diagnosis because the patient already has 3 other diagnostic criteria, including a malar rash, a photosensitive rash, and signs of nephritis. Systemic lupus erythematosus has a broad clinical spectrum, making initial diagnosis challenging, especially if the presenting symptoms are in isolation or nonspecific. Not all patients will initially present with all 4 diagnostic criteria, also resulting in diagnostic delay. Up to 20% of cases of SLE are seen in childhood and it is more common in girls than in boys, as well as in Asian, African-American, and Hispanic populations compared with white patients. Teenagers with SLE often have fever, Raynaud phenomenon, abdominal complaints, and/or a positive family history, but these are not among the diagnostic criteria for SLE. Hematologic, mucocutaneous, renal, and arthritis-related clinical presentations are also common in childhood SLE. Renal manifestations vary from mild asymptomatic microscopic hematuria to severe acute kidney injury, nephrotic syndrome, and hypertension. Acute and/or chronic interstitial nephritis with renal tubular dysfunction can also develop. There are varied opinions on whether all patients newly diagnosed with SLE require a renal biopsy. Given the presence of hematuria and 3+ proteinuria in the patient in the vignette, a biopsy is clearly indicated to classify her lupus nephritis and determine her treatment regimen and prognosis. However, because of the renal findings seen on urine testing, the biopsy will not add to the official diagnostic criteria. Even so, for a patient with nonspecific symptoms or without all 4 diagnostic criteria, a renal biopsy with findings classic for lupus nephritis may be highly suggestive and warrant management and treatment accordingly. As noted earlier, the biopsy is critically important in the patient in this vignette because severe cases of lupus nephritis can present with only mild to no outward symptoms other than asymptomatic microscopic hematuria and proteinuria. If lupus nephritis is left untreated or not responsive to treatment, it can lead to progressive chronic kidney disease, including end-stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours . 8/24/2019 ap.org/script/may?req=201908241116167699&s May | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 3 PREP Pearls + Systemic lupus erythematosus has a broad spectrum of initial presenting symptoms which may develop simultaneously or serially. + Renal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus may be mild to severe and include isolated asymptomatic microscopic hematuria to acute kidney injury, nephrotic syndrome, and hypertension, as well as acute and/or chronic interstitial nephritis with renal tubular dysfunction. * Renal biopsy is critically important because the severity of lupus nephritis does not correlate with the degree of hematuria and proteinuria. + If renal manifestations go undiagnosed or untreated, it may lead to progressive chronic kidney disease including end-stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy.

As indicated by the name, pulmonary renal syndrome involves concomitant pulmonary disease with glomerular disease. Specific pulmonary renal syndrome involves alveolar hemorrhage and manifests as hemoptysis, lung hemorrhage, infiltrates, or nodules. This contrasts with “nonspecific” pulmonary renal syndromes; these refer to the broad spectrum of lung diseases that may occur together with glomerular disease, including infections, thromboembolism, and pulmonary edema. In children, specific pulmonary renal syndrome is rare but may occur with lupus nephritis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis and anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis (Goodpasture syndrome). Anti-GBM nephritis is very rare in children; however, Goodpasture syndrome is the most common cause of pulmonary renal syndrome in adults. The pulmonary and renal manifestations of Goodpasture syndrome are caused by autoantibodies that bind type IV collagen in the pulmonary and glomerular basement membranes, making this the preferred response. Double-stranded DNA antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis. Lupus nephritis is likely the most common overall cause of pulmonary renal syndrome in children but is less likely in this patient with normal complements and negative antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Phospholipase A2 antibodies are the cause of primary membranous nephropathy, which typically presents with nephrotic syndrome and not pulmonary renal syndrome. Antibodies to streptolysin O are associated with postinfectious glomerulonephritis, which typically presents with acute nephritis but not pulmonary renal syndrome. After lupus, ANCA-associated vasculitis is likely the next most common cause of pulmonary renal syndrome in children. Antibodies to neutrophils (ANCAs) are associated with pauci-immune vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener) and microscopic polyangiitis. Both can have pulmonary manifestations, but respiratory tract involvement is more common in GPA. Goodpasture syndrome typically refers to dual pulmonary and renal manifestations, whereas anti-GBM disease may involve renal manifestations alone. The most common anti-GBM autoantibody is |gG against the http://2019.prepnephrology.cours . 8/24/2019 ap.org/script/may?req=20 1908241 122462707&s May | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 noncollagenous (NC1) domain of the type IV collagen a-3 chain. Host and environmental factors may protect or predispose patients to developing anti- GBM antibodies: host factors include polymorphisms in human leukocyte antigen major histocompatibility class Il complex gene DRB7, while predisposing environmental exposures include cigarette smoke or hydrocarbons. Anti-GBM disease can also occur in conjunction with other diseases, such as ANCA-associated vasculitis. Basement membranes are composed of collagens, laminins, nidogens, and heparin sulfate proteoglycans. Collagen chains form heterotrimers into 3 main types of type IV collagen—a1a1a2,a3a4a5,anda5a5a6. Of these, a 3a 4a 5 is present in glomerular and alveolar basement membranes; thus, anti-GBM antibodies deposit in these 2 locations. Deposition along the basement membranes of both alveolar and glomeruli triggers an inflammatory response with antibody-mediated complement activation. Treatment of pulmonary renal syndrome typically includes 1) plasmapheresis with therapeutic plasma exchange to remove the anti-GBM antibodies; and 2) immunosuppression to prevent antibody formation and decrease the inflammatory response. For immunosuppressives, corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide are most common. Goodpasture treatment may have serious potential adverse effects and complications (Table).

      "3% saline, 220 mL over 2 hours The patient in the vignette has acute hyponatremia likely related to excessive fluid intake in the setting of chronic kidney disease. He has had seizures and persistent neurologic findings that are concerning. In this case, administration of hypertonic saline is indicated to prevent further seizures. Administration of 3% saline, 514 mmol/L, will raise the serum sodium approximately 1 mEq/L (1 mmol/L) for every 1 mL/kg of 3% saline given. Bringing the serum sodium up to 125 mEq/L (125 mmol/L) quickly would require approximately 220 mL of 3% saline (55 kg x 4 mEq/L). Rapid partial correction of hyponatremia is indicated when there are signs of seizures or cerebral edema. Symptoms associated with hyponatremia, such as headache, nausea, and confusion, are often nonspecific. The condition may progress to seizures and respiratory arrest along with death caused by cerebral edema if left untreated. The initial correction may be as high as 5 or 6 mEq/L (5-6 mmol/L) in the first couple of hours. After initial treatment, it is necessary to determine the cause of hyponatremia to plan for its correction. The first step in evaluating hyponatremia is to assess volume status of the patient and the renal sodium excretion. The patient in the vignette is euvolemic with water intoxication and would be expected to have a low fractional excretion of sodium (<0.5%). A patient with euvolemia and high fractional excretion of sodium could have the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), glucocorticoid deficiency, hypothyroidism, or some drugs (eg, vincristine, carbamazepine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/may?req=201908241110472067&sta... 8/24/2019 May | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 Patients who are deemed hypovolemic and who have a low fractional excretion of sodium (<0.5%) likely have extrarenal loss of sodium more than water, as occurs with vomiting, third space losses due to burns, trauma, or surgery, diarrhea, or excessive sweating. Hypovolemic patients with high fractional excretion of sodium may have renal loss of sodium because of diuretics, salt-losing nephropathy, or mineralocorticoid deficiency. Patients who are hypovolemic and have a high fractional excretion of sodium usually have acute or chronic renal failure. For the boy in the vignette, the renal insufficiency may make his fractional excretion of sodium higher than that anticipated with water intoxication. Hypervolemic patients with low fractional excretion of sodium have edema because of nephrotic syndrome, heart failure, or cirrhosis. In addition, the plasma osmolality should be assessed because of potential 1) pseudohyponatremia with normal plasma osmolality caused by hyperlipidemia or hyperparaproteinemia, or 2) translocational hyponatremia with high plasma osmolarity because of the presence of glucose, mannitol, glycine, or contrast in patients with progressive chronic kidney disease. For patients who do not have neurologic manifestations or who have been initially treated, it is important to plan a slow correction of hyponatremia. There are no randomized trials of the optimal speed of correction but recent guidelines have suggested a slower replacement than traditionally recommended, especially for those with chronic and more severe (<120 mEq/L [120 mmol/L]) hyponatremia. Recent American and European adult guidelines suggest a limit of 10 mEq/L (10 mmol/L) for the first-day correction with a daily correction limit of 8 mEq/L (8 mmol/L) thereafter. Some patients are at high risk for complications (those with malnutrition, hypoxia, hypokalemia, liver disease, and sodium concentration <105 mEq/L [105 mmol/L]) and may require even slower correction. Overly aggressive correction of hyponatremia can result in demyelination of parts of the central nervous system including the pontine area. This complication is typically not manifest in the first 48 hours after correction . 8/24/2019 http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/may?req=201908241110472067&s May | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 but occurs 2 to 7 days after overly rapid correction. Symptoms include problems with speaking, ataxia, paralysis, facial muscle control deficits (pseudobulbar palsy), and behavioral issues. The sodium deficit in a hyponatremic patient can be calculated by taking the difference between the current and desired sodium level and multiplying that by the total body water. The total body water is calculated by taking the weight in kilograms and multiplying by 0.6 in children. In infants, the constant is higher (0.75) because of the higher body water content. If the patient in the vignette did not have neurologic symptoms and did not require the initial 3% hypertonic saline, his first day correction could be 10 mEq/L. His body water is 55 kg x 0.6 = 33 L. Thus he could be treated with 330 mEq of sodium over the first day. During correction, maintenance requirements of sodium and water should be conservative and any hypokalemia should also be addressed. As noted before, with neurologic complications of hyponatremia, partial initial correction is indicated. The use of furosemide would usually be restricted to those with fluid overload and a low urinary sodium such as seen with congestive heart failure, liver disease, or nephrotic syndrome. Fluid restriction would be indicated for patients with fluid overload especially those with acute or chronic kidney disease, and for patients with euvolemia with SIADH. The administration of 200 mL/hour of normal saline would lead to correction of hyponatremia but would be inadequate in the setting of neurologic complications. PREP Pearls + Neurologic symptoms in hyponatremia should prompt rapid partial correction with hypertonic saline. + Complete correction should be achieved over several days to prevent complications. + Sequelae of overly rapid correction may not manifest for 2 to 7 days.

It is characterized by the development of numerous autoantibodies to nuclear antigens including double-stranded DNA. Kidney involvement (eg, lupus nephritis) is seen in almost half of all patients with lupus and carries a high risk of eventually leading to end-stage kidney disease and even death. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/june?req=20 1908241 126344118&sta... 8/24/2019 June | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 3 Systemic lupus erythematosus is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors. The importance of estrogen in disease is underscored by the finding that lupus is 9 times more common in postpubertal female than male patients. Consistent with this, in prepubertal individuals, females outnumber males by only a 4:3 ratio. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on SLE have identified genes that can increase the risk of developing systemic disease. However, SLE has a polygenic basis. The candidate genes identified with GWAS are all related to innate and adaptive immunity and underline the importance in a breakdown in self- tolerance as key to the pathogenesis of SLE. For example, HLA-DR alleles can increase the risk of SLE, and these genes are involved in the presentation of antigens within the class Il major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The /TGAM gene encodes for the CD11b-integrin on phagocytic cells that is involved in binding to complement C3. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within this gene can increase the risk of developing SLE and underscores the role that complement plays in clearing immune complexes. Along a similar vein, SNP within the Fc-gamma receptor also increases the risk of SLE via impairment in the recognition and clearance of immune complexes. Environmental factors clearly play a role in the development of lupus based on the observation that exposure to sunlight can trigger flares. Similarly, exposure to procainamide or hydralazine can lead to drug-induced lupus. Recent research into epigenetics has provided a common mechanism in which DNA hypomethylation in T cells leads to gene activation in T cells, which in genetically susceptible individuals, leads to a breakdown in self-tolerance and promotes autoimmunity. For the woman in the vignette, genetic testing is the best option because identification of HLA-DR alleles or SNPs in CD11b or the Fc-gamma receptors could point to her genetic susceptibility to lupus. However, it should be noted that because of the polygenic nature of SLE, genetic testing cannot offer a precise risk similar to that available for monogenic diseases with an autosomal dominant or recessive basis. Based on the female predominance of disease, any male child would be less likely to develop lupus. Whites are less likely to develop SLE than are blacks, and are likely to have different risks of passing on the disease to their offspring. . 8/24/2019 http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/june?req=20 1908241 126344118&s June | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 3 High-risk alleles of APOL7 are often found in individuals of African descent.

      "partially compensated metabolic acidosis from diarrhea and incomplete respiratory response Acid-base control is critical for normal homeostatic functions in the body. Acids are continuously produced by metabolism, and the body must constantly neutralize these acids. Within blood, acid exists in many forms, one of which is dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2), while the predominant base in blood is bicarbonate (HCO3-). Acid-base control is broadly achieved through 3 mechanisms: * Immediate but low magnitude buffering of acid by blood and bone buffers, without net excretion + Fast but higher magnitude respiratory compensation involving hyperventilation and higher washout of blood CO2 to eliminate acid + Aslow and high magnitude sustained response from the kidneys The kidneys can both retain base and excrete acid. In general, base reabsorption occurs first proximally, before acid excretion into the renal tubular lumen distally. Otherwise, logically, the secreted H* would combine with filtered HCO3- in the lumen, form H2CO3, and break down into CO2 and H20. The CO? is freely diffusible across cell membranes and would be reabsorbed, leading to a net increase in acid in blood and loss of the filtered http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/june?req=20 1908241 143008826&sta... 8/24/2019 June | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 HCO3-. Reabsorption of the filtered HCO3- proximally is also consistent with the general reabsorptive nature of the proximal nephron segments (glucose, phosphorus, amino acids). Although not a principle, understanding the serum anion gap is also helpful. This gap is an artifact of our measurements. Blood is electroneutral, and all blood cations must equal all blood anions. However, we concentrate on the major cations (Na+, K+) and major anions (Cl-, CO2) in our laboratory measures, ignoring the many unmeasured anions such as sulfates and albumin, thereby leading to a positive serum anion gap, which is typically calculated as: Na+ - (Cl- + C02) Even after understanding these principles, classifying the type of acid-base disorder in a clinical scenario can often be confusing to medical professionals. However, classifying an acid-base disorder is easiest if done in an ordered stepwise fashion. The infant in this vignette has a low blood pH of 7.20 (normal, 7.35-7.45), indicating a systemic acidemia. Acidosis can be metabolic, respiratory, or mixed metabolic and respiratory. Sometimes the patient's history can point to the etiology of the acidosis. A patient with only diarrhea and no evidence of respiratory dysfunction (eg, hypoventilation, alveolar inflammation) is more likely to have a metabolic acidosis. If both respiratory and metabolic derangements are present, the challenge is to figure out which derangement is primary and whether or not there is compensation by the other system. This infant in this vignette has a 3-day history of diarrhea, which is long enough to cause dehydration, suggesting that at least one component of the acidosis is metabolic. The diarrhea is the only symptom, suggesting that metabolic acidosis is a primary event. However, the infant also has a history of severe prematurity, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and intraventricular hemorrhage. The key to assessing whether the infant has a respiratory compensation (complete or partial) lies in the respiratory rate and pCO2. An appropriate response to a metabolic acidosis would be hyperventilation to wash out the pCO2 to a lower level (normal, 35-40 mm Hg). However, this infant has a respiratory rate of only 22 breaths/min and a pCO2 of 45 mm Hg, which is in the opposite direction from what you would expect, indicating an impaired respiratory compensation mechanism. Therefore, this infant is not experiencing pure metabolic acidosis from diarrhea with appropriate respiratory . 8/24/2019 http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/june?req=20 1908241 143008826&s June | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 compensation, because a complete compensation would lead to a normal pH and low pCO2. The infant is also not experiencing partially compensated metabolic acidosis from diarrhea and incomplete respiratory response, because a partial response, although still associated with a low pH, would also show a low pCO2. The explanation of combined metabolic acidosis from diarrhea and distal renal tubular acidosis would be associated with a systemic acidosis. However, it includes the component of distal renal tubular acidosis, which would likely then show a normal serum anion gap (< 12) and hyperchloremia (serum Cl > 110 mEq/L) and an inappropriately higher than expected urine pH. This infant has an elevated serum anion gap of 29 and an appropriately highly acidic urine pH of 5.5. Diarrhea can cause a normal anion gap acidosis and, when associated with dehydration, also can lead to tissue lactic acidosis from poor perfusion, which can then cause a high anion gap acidosis. Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis from diarrhea with central hypoxic brain damage is thus the explanation that is most consistent with this vignette. The infant has a past medical history to suggest a central respiratory drive impairment, with superimposed acute diarrhea as the metabolic component. The infant has a systemic acidosis, a low serum HCO3- value, and an elevated pCO2, suggesting both metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Renal acidification responses are appropriate. Nomograms (as shown in the Figure) can be useful in identifying the type of acid-base derangement, provided that the components of the nomogram are well understood. The key points listed below the nomogram allow for a better understanding of its use. PREP Pearls + Abedside estimate of appropriate respiratory compensation can be made by equating the last 2 digits of the pH to the expected pCO2 level. For example, in this patient with a pH of 7.20, the expected compensated pCO2 would be 20 mm Hg. * Complex patients often have a mixed disorder. + Figuring out a specific patient's acid-base derangement is best done in ordered stepwise fashion. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours . 8/24/2019 ap.org/script/june?req=20 1908241 143008826&s June | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 5 of 5 ABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area + Understand the concept of mixed acid-base disorders Suggested Readings Bianchetti MG, Bettinelli A.

A ureterocele is a cystic dilation of the terminal ureter. Ureteroceles are classified based on their location, either intravesical or ectopic. Intravesical ureteroceles exist entirely within the bladder, whereas ectopic ureteroceles extend beyond the bladder neck into the urethra. Usually, ureteroceles can be diagnosed with ultrasonography. Bladder ultrasonography will identify a well-defined cystic structure in the bladder. The management and complications associated with ureteroceles are specific to the location of the ureterocele. Because of a high incidence of associated abnormalities in patients with ureterocele, additional investigation is required to identify associated abnormalities. Duplex systems are common in http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/june?req=20 1908241 133182720&s . 8/24/2019 June | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 3 ureterocele even on the contralateral side in the case of unilateral ureterocele. When a duplex system is present, approximately 80% of ureteroceles are associated with the ureter of the upper pole, and these ureteroceles are more commonly ectopic. Vesicoureteral reflux, especially when a duplex system is present, occurs in up to 50% of ipsilateral systems and 25% of contralateral systems. In patients with urinary tract infections or ultrasonography findings suggestive of duplex systems or hydroureter, a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) should be obtained. Especially in ectopic ureteroceles, the distal system and bladder outlet can be obstructed. In these patients, radionuclide renography should be considered to assess drainage of the systems and renal function of associated renal segments in the case of duplex systems to help guide surgical management. Furthermore, these patients are at risk for urinary tract infection especially when vesicoureteral reflux and/or obstruction are present. Most cases of ureterocele require additional intervention. Until obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux can be ruled out, patients should receive antibiotic prophylaxis. Surgical intervention is usually needed to correct/decompress the ureterocele. The surgical approach used depends on the location, age, and presence of duplex systems. The surgical treatment ranges from simple endoscopic puncture or incision to open reconstructive surgery. A meta- analysis on children undergoing endoscopic management identified independent risk factors for additional surgical intervention. Ectopic ureteroceles, duplex systems, and vesicoureteral reflux had a higher rate of reoperation compared with single systems and intravesical ureteroceles. If a duplex system is present with a poorly functioning associated renal pole, heminephrectomy can also be considered for definitive treatment. Because the 2 month old in the vignette has had a urinary tract infection, one must strongly consider antibiotic prophylaxis during additional workup. Nothing in the vignette or clinical entity of ureteroceles denotes that antibiotic prophylaxis is contraindicated. Although some ureteroceles will resolve and can be monitored as outlined by Pohl, the patient with a urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux most likely needs intervention. Thus, reassurance is probably not the best option at this point. Ureteroceles are not associated with malignant transformation, nor does the cystic structure resemble a malignancy. Therefore, referral to oncology is not necessary.

      "serum creatinine is concerning for traumatic acute kidney injury",
      "vital signs are concerning for renal parenchymal bleeding Renal injury is a significant concern in children who are involved in motor vehicle accidents, and in those who experience falls or sports-related injuries. Such blunt trauma can be from a direct blow to the kidney or from a crush injury against paravertebral muscles, avulsion injuries that include the ureteropelvic junction or the renal vasculature, or from arterial dissection because of rapid deceleration. Children are at greater risk for renal injury than adults experiencing the same mechanism of injury because the kidneys take up a larger proportion of the abdominal cavity in children than in adults. In addition, the ribs confer less protection in children: pediatric kidneys extend further beyond the rib cage than do adult kidneys; pediatric ribs are more flexible and as a result provide less rigid protection than mature adult ribs. Less developed pediatric abdominal and trunk muscles also provide less direct protection and rigid support than seen in adults, and retroperitoneal and peritoneal fat that serves to buffer the kidney is much less available in children than in adults. In addition, persistent fetal lobulations that are common in younger children may present natural cleavage planes that are susceptible to trauma forces. In addition to these features, congenital malformations of the kidney and urinary tract are more likely to sustain trauma when exposed to blunt forces than kidneys without malformations. For example, a hydronephrotic kidney is more likely to rupture and have extravasation into both the extraperitoneal and intraperitoneal space than a normal kidney in response to the same exposure. Penetrating renal injury, as seen with firearms and stab wounds, are also a concern in the pediatric age group. However, blunt renal trauma is more common than penetrating injuries. Renal injury should be suspected when the patient or family describes a rapid deceleration injury, a direct blow to the back or flank, or a penetrating injury in proximity to the kidney. Patients and families may also report gross hematuria or bleeding from the vagina or urinary . 8/24/2019 http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/june?req=20 1908241 143366795&s June | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 meatus. Other history, physical examination findings, and laboratory findings that should raise suspicion for renal trauma or support concern for renal trauma are listed in Table 1. Of these findings, hematuria is the most common and concerning finding for renal trauma (blunt>penetrating). In fact, less than 3% of renal injuries present without gross or microscopic hematuria. The one exception to this are renal injuries that result in complete disruptions to the ureteropelvic junction or injury to the renal pedicle. These uncommon renal injuries, which can occur with rapid deceleration, often do NOT have associated hematuria. When hematuria is present, it is generally caused by parenchymal or renal vessel injury; injury to the collecting system does not typically cause appreciable hematuria. Further, although the degree of hematuria (gross or microscopic) does not predict the severity of kidney injury, screening for its presence is an essential part of the evaluation of any child with suspected renal injury. Because intravenous fluids can dilute the urine, urine screening for hematuria should be conducted early in the patient assessment. Finally, although hematuria is seen in most cases of renal trauma, it is important to note that clean urine alone does not rule out the possibility of renal injury. Children who present with any of the following clinical scenarios should undergo renal imaging to stage the degree of renal trauma (Table 2) because this will help determine management: History of penetrating trauma to the abdomen, flank, or lower chest with entry/exit wounds suggesting a path that includes the kidney. History of blunt trauma to the abdomen + gross hematuria. History of blunt trauma to the abdomen + microscopic hematuria + hemodynamic instability History/physical examination findings associated with high likelihood of renal injury, including multiple abdominal injuries, direct blow to the back and/or flank, and displaced rib fractures, regardless of presence of hematuria. Elevated creatinine concentration found on initial evaluation of someone who has sustained renal injury is most often reflective of underlying chronic kidney disease and not acute kidney injury. The contralateral uninjured kidney is able to maintain normal renal function in the face of significant trauma. The exception to this rule is when a solitary kidney or both kidneys sustain severe injury. . 8/24/2019 http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/june?req=20 1908241 143366795&s June | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 In adults, hypotension is a reliable marker for more severe renal injury. In children, however, this is less reliable as a predictor because children are better able to support blood pressure when faced with hypovolemia, as can occur with significant bleeding. Because of this, hypotension is not a criterion for imaging and evaluation for renal injury. The child in the vignette was involved in a rapid deceleration injury, which is a risk factor for renal injury. Despite being restrained in an appropriate safety seat, she is at greater risk for renal injury because of her history of hydronephrosis. Her vital signs are unremarkable, and her elevated creatinine concentration is likely related to chronic kidney disease or volume depletion. Therefore, of the clinical data available, her microscopic hematuria is most concerning for occult renal trauma and warrants imaging. PREP Pearls * Children who experience blunt and/or penetrating trauma to the abdomen, flank, or chest should have a urinalysis to screen for hematuria. + Younger children and those with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract are more susceptible to renal trauma when exposed to blunt and/or penetrating injury. * Lack of hematuria, normotension, and normal creatinine do NOT rule out renal injury in at-risk children; the mechanism of injury and other physical examination and laboratory findings should also be taken into account.

Primary nocturnal enuresis occurs when the aforementioned factors are not aligned and in balance. For example, if antidiuretic hormone secretion does not increase in sleep, urine does not get concentrated and the urinary bladder may fill up too early. Which type of sleep pattern is associated with nocturnal enuresis is still debatable. Some researchers believe that enuresis is associated with “deep sleep” related to a high arousal threshold, though it is not proven and largely subjective. Others correlate it with disturbed or “light sleep” with reduced ability to wake up for voiding. Enuresis is inherited in most cases, but the correlation between genotype and enuretic phenotype is not straightforward and no specific genes are consistently implicated. Several therapeutic options exist. Desmopressin is an arginine vasopressin analog that has only urinary concentrating activity, without the vasopressor actions. Oxybutynin and hyoscyamine are anticholinergic agents that relax the urinary bladder, reduce overactivity, and allow it to hold more urine volume. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that induces arousal from sleep. Enuresis alarms have a moisture detector in the underwear, which triggers an audible alarm at the initiation of voiding. This prompts the child to wake up before fully voiding and go to the bathroom to urinate. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) reduces bladder overactivity and strengthens sphincter control mechanisms. The boy in the vignette has classic isolated PNE. He also has monosymptomatic (monoepisodic) enuresis, wetting just once each night. In this situation, an enuresis alarm or desmopressin is the preferred agent. This child has already failed the enuresis alarm, hence desmopressin is the best choice from the options presented. Together, the monosymptomatic type, with absence of daytime wetting and a normal urine volume on the voiding diary, all suggest that a small bladder capacity seems unlikely. Hence bladder-relaxing agents, anticholinergic agents like oxybutynin or hyoscyamine, would not be the preferred initial agent. Imipramine can be http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/june?req=20 1908241 144045077 8/24/2019 June | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 effective in PNE, but has associated neurologic side effects (insomnia, anxiety, personality changes); therefore it is no longer a first-line pharmacologic agent for enuresis. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is used in adult incontinence and is being studied in PNE. But a recent double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed no benefit of reduced bedwetting with TENS, compared with placebo, in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis without nocturnal polyuria. Neither nocturnal urine production nor bladder capacity was changed during and after this mode of treatment. The response choices listed do not include any combination therapies. In a recent meta-analysis of 18 RCTs including 1,649 subjects, combinations of desmopressin and anticholinergic agents showed higher complete response rates than with either desmopressin or alarm alone. Desmopressin combined with alarm therapy had higher success rates than use of an alarm alone. Desmopressin plus anticholinergics and desmopressin plus alarm therapy were equally good with regard to complete response rate and success rate. Desmopressin plus alarm therapy performed the best for mean number of wet nights per week. The lowest relapse rate was seen with alarm therapy.

      "VDR, encoding for vitamin D receptor Rickets is caused by deficiencies of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus leading to delay of mineralization, widening of the growth plate, and skeletal abnormalities. Nutritional rickets is the most common form of rickets worldwide. Mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in vitamin D activation and function and phosphorus metabolism have been described. Calcium and phosphorus are regulated by vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF23), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) through their actions on the intestine, kidney, and bone. Vitamin D is a biologically inactive prohormone that exists as ergocalciferol (D2) in fungi and yeast or cholecalciferol (D3) produced by near UV irradiation from 7-dehydrocholesterol in human skin (270-314 nm). Vitamin D is hydroxylated at the 25 position (calcidiol) in the liver by hepatic 25-hydroxylase encoded by CYP2R7. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) undergoes 1a-hydroxylation in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25] (OH]2D) by 10-hydroxylase encoded by CYP27B7 and tightly regulated by http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/june?req=20 1908241 142070700 8/24/2019 June | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 PTH, calcium, phosphorus, FGF23, and 1,25(OH)2D. Inactivation of 1,25(OH) 2D and 25(OH)D occurs in the kidney and intestine by hydroxylation at the 24 position by 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase (24-hydroxylase) encoded by CYP24A7. 1,25(OH)2D acts through vitamin D receptor (VDR), forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor, then binds to vitamin D response element (VDRE) leading to initiation of many processes, including increase in intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption by upregulating intestinal transport NPT2B (NaPi-IIb). The boy in the vignette has clinical, radiographic, and biochemical findings of rickets. Low 25(OH)D with normal 1,25(O0H)2D is more compatible with deficiency of 25-hydroxylase (type 1B vitamin D-dependent rickets) because of a genetic mutation of CYP2R7. CYP27B7 mutation is associated with normal 25(OH)D and low 1,25(OH)2D, and VDR mutation has low 25(0H)D with elevated 1,25(OH)2D, whereas CYP24A7 encodes 24-hydroxylase responsible for inactivating vitamin D metabolites. Rickets can be classified according to abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, or vitamin D. Vitamin D Related 1. Vitamin D-dependent rickets: Type IA: Autosomal recessive (AR), 10-hydroxylase deficiency (OMIM #264700), impaired hydroxylation of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, because of renal disease or mutations in CYP2787. Usually presents before age 2 years with skeletal abnormalities, hypotonia, growth, and dental problems. Laboratory findings include hyperphosphatasia, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, low 1,25(OH)2D, and normal to high 25(OH)D. Type 1B: AR, hepatic 25-hydroxylase deficiency (OMIM #600081) leading to impaired hydroxylation of vitamin D because of inactivating mutations of CYP2R7. Biochemical features include hyperphosphatasia, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, low 25(OH)D levels, low to normal 1,25 http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/june?req=20 1908241 142070700 8/24/2019 June | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 (OH)2D levels. Type 2A: AR, VDR mutations (OMIM #277440) including the DNA-binding domain or ligand-binding domain, prevents binding of VDR to DNA which can lead to partial or total 1,25(OH)2D resistance. Clinical presentation includes seizures from hypocalcemia, tooth enamel problems, respiratory issues, alopecia. Normal 25(OH)D with elevated 1,25(0H)2D levels. Type 2B: End-organ resistance to vitamin D due to overexpression of VDRE- binding ribonucleoprotein (OMIM #600785). Biochemical abnormalities include hypo- or normocalcemia, normal serum phosphorus, elevated alkaline phosphatase, secondary hyperparathyroidism. Normal 25(OH)D with elevated 1,25(OH)2D levels. Possible type 3: Accelerated inactivation of vitamin D because of mutations in CYP34A. 2. Insufficient vitamin D intake: Epidermal UV radiation, intestinal malabsorption (obstructive jaundice). 3. Increased degradation of vitamin D: Medications (phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and rifampin). Calcium Related Deficiency could be dietary or related to gastrointestinal disorders causing calcium malabsorption.

      "during training, he should weigh himself before and after workouts to estimate his water needs during the race Participating in an endurance sports event during the summer places an individual at risk for dehydration as the body produces sweat to maintain normal body temperature. Studies of healthy male volunteers have showed that following heat-acclimation, the sodium concentration of sweat is between 30 and 50 mEq/L (30-50 mmol/L), depending on the rate at which sweat is being produced. Most commercial electrolyte sports drinks only contain a small amount of sodium (10-20 mEq/L [10-20 mmol/L]), which is not enough to prevent hyponatremia. During exercise, an individual is at risk of developing hyponatremia when water or sports drinks are used to replace sweat. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/july?req=201908241209532453&sta... 8/24/2019 July | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 3 In a study of approximately 750 participants in the 2002 Boston Marathon, 13% developed serum sodium concentrations of less than 136 mmol/L. Three runners were found to have developed severe hyponatremia with serum sodium concentrations less than 120 mEq/L (120 mmol/L). In multivariate analysis, the development of hyponatremia was most strongly associated with longer race times and an increase in weight at the end of the race by at least 3 kg compared to prerace weight. There was no association between the development of hyponatremia and the use of electrolyte-containing sports drinks compared with water. The patient in the vignette has a normal functioning solitary kidney, and therefore no special precautions are needed. Given the variation with which individuals produce sweat, the best advice for the teenage marathon participant is to weigh himself during training and find a fluid intake that does not produce a significant change in overall body weight. There is no advantage to drinking commercial electrolyte sports drinks over water. Encouraging him to drink fluids at every aid station independent of thirst is likely to lead to excessive weight gain during the race and increase his risk of developing hyponatremia.

Ammonia is the predominant urinary buffer in patients with chronic metabolic acidosis and aldosterone plays an important role in ammoniagenesis. In the collecting duct, aldosterone stimulates reabsorption of sodium, generating lumen-negative voltage gradient, which drives the secretion of potassium by principal cells and hydrogen by a-intercalated cells. Aldosterone stimulates the Na+/K+-ATPase, ENaC, ROMK, and H-ATPase transporters for these actions. Ammonia produced in proximal tubules from glutamine reaches the renal medulla through NKCC transporter in the loop of Henle and then is secreted in the urine in the distal nephron. Protons secreted by a-intercalated cells are important in urinary buffering, leading to protonation of NH3 to NH4+. Acquired or inherited disorders leading to interruption of the actions of aldosterone because of decreased production or receptor insensitivity will lead to electrolyte abnormalities consistent with type IV renal tubular acidosis (RTA), as seen in this patient. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/july?req=201908241210299641 &sta... 8/24/2019 July | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 Transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) estimating distal tubular fluid potassium concentration was proposed as a surrogate for estimating the adequacy of aldosterone secretion in patients with hyperkalemia. However, in view of questionable validity of the underlying assumptions in TTKG calculation, it is not recommended for evaluating patients with hyperkalemia. Serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity (PRA) are helpful in understanding the pathophysiology and thereby identifying the etiology of type IV RTA (Figure). Based on the high PRA and inappropriately low serum aldosterone level in this patient, lisinopril is the most likely cause of hyperkalemia. The other response choices listed can also cause type IV RTA or metabolic acidosis (diarrhea) but will be associated with different PRA and aldosterone profiles. Decreased PRA and serum aldosterone levels are most frequently noticed in patients with type IV RTA. However, for this patient, plasma aldosterone is inappropriately low for the level of hyperkalemia while PRA is elevated. Drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin blockers, heparin, and ketoconazole, which inhibit the synthesis of aldosterone downstream from renin, lead to type IV RTA associated with increased PRA and low serum aldosterone levels. Both the PRA and serum aldosterone level are low in pseudohypoaldosteronism type Il (Gordon syndrome), mild to moderate renal failure, glomerulonephritis (associated with volume overload), diabetes mellitus, and HIV infection. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, and calcineurin inhibitors can also cause type IV RTA associated with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. In type IV RTA associated with elevated PRA and serum aldosterone level (voltage-dependent hyperkalemia), resistance to aldosterone is the underlying mechanism for hypoaldosteronism. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene) and antibiotics (high-dose trimethoprim, pentamidine) inhibit the epithelial sodium channel in the collecting tubule, leading to aldosterone resistance. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by aldosterone resistance. Acquired or congenital defects in sodium http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/july?req=201908241210299641 &sta... 8/24/2019 July | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 reabsorption by principal cells in the distal tubule such as obstructive uropathy can result in hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and voltage- dependent hyperkalemic RTA. The underlying etiology directs the treatment for type IV RTA. If feasible, cessation or replacement of the offending drug results in resolution of the associated electrolyte abnormalities. In patients with hypoaldosteronism resulting from low plasma aldosterone-associated primary adrenal disease, mineralocorticoid replacement with fludrocortisone (0.2-1.0 mg/day) is indicated. In adrenal disease associated with cortisol/glucocorticoid deficiency, steroid therapy is also needed. In patients with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, fludrocortisone is usually contraindicated in view of the associated volume overload and renal dysfunction leading to worsening volume status and hyperkalemia. In such patients, hyperkalemia could be managed by dietary restriction, loop diuretics, or cation exchange resins. Metabolic acidosis in type IV RTA is usually mild and can be corrected with sodium bicarbonate therapy (1.5-2.0 mEq/kg per day).

      "24-hour urine collection for calcium and creatinine The girl in the vignette presents with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. Her family history, review of systems, and laboratory evaluation is remarkable for microscopic hematuria and a low C4 complement. She has no elevated inflammatory markers or complaints. She would best be served by a follow-up evaluation with urinalysis and blood pressure measurement in 6 months. This is based on the literature surrounding asymptomatic microscopic hematuria and an understanding of variations in complement proteins. In patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, the C3 complement may be checked. Low C3 glomerular disease would commonly be the result of a postinfectious glomerulonephritis, subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) -associated glomerulonephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-associated glomerulonephritis. In postinfectious glomerulonephritis, the C3 typically normalizes in more than 90% of patients by 12 weeks. Typically, other symptoms are seen associated with SBE that cause glomerular disease. Thus, the main use of C3 in this setting is to screen for the possibility of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis or SLE. Total deficiency of C3 is associated with recurrent severe infections early in life with encapsulated organisms such as pneumococcus or Haemophilus influenzae. People with 1 active gene copy are clinically well, with C3 levels approximately half normal. A mildly depressed C4 is an expected finding in 1% to 3% of the white population. The C4 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 in the HLA class 3 region. The copy numbers vary, with people typically having between 1 and 8 copies. In addition, there are 2 variants, C4A and C4B, which differ in 4 amino acids, with differing activities in purified assays but not in ex vivo assays. Functionally this leads to a gene dosage effect on C4 activity. http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/july?req=201908241211146361&sta... 8/24/2019 July | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 Because of the variability in C4 levels, which is not associated with clinical disease, many clinicians do not check C4 levels when evaluating for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. The risk of SLE appears to be somewhat elevated in patients with very low copy numbers of active C4 gene. Much of this clusters around those with functional levels below 50% of normal. Thus, the child in the vignette who has close to normal levels would have minimal risk elevation. In very rare patients, a complete deficiency of active C4 gene product is noted. These patients have a high propensity (>75%) for glomerular diseases such as SLE and a high risk of infectious complications, especially after renal transplantation. C1, C2, and C4 are important in the early stages of the classic pathway of complement activation, and C4 and C2 are involved in the early stages of the Lectin-binding pathway of complement activation (Figure). The classic pathway can be assessed with the CH50 assay, which requires all components of the classic pathway (C1-C9). Typically, components have to be reduced well below 50% before affecting this functional assay. An exception is C2, which is of rate-limiting importance, and C2 heterozygotes may have mildly low levels. C2 deficiency is found in approximately 1 in 20,000 white patients. There are 2 common deletions that lead to nonsense mutations in the C2 gene (and inactive protein). The C2 gene is present in the HLA class III region, and these deletions are associated with different HLA classes. In addition, a second missense mutation accounts for about 10% of C2 deficiency that leads to a protein that is made but not secreted. About 10% of patients with C2 deficiency will develop SLE. This may tend to be of earlier onset but less severity than typically seen. C1 is a another component of the classic pathway. There are 3 components (C1q, Cir, and C1s) of the C1 complex. Deficiency of any 1 component may lead to SLE or SLE-like disease process. Deficiency of C1q is the most common cause of C1 deficiency, but is rare (<80 cases of homozygous deficiency in the literature) and the C1q protein is coded for by 3 different http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/july?req=201908241211146361&sta... 8/24/2019 July | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 genes, C1gA, C1qB, and C1qC. Individuals with homozygous deficiency in C1q may have an SLE or SLE-like disease process in more than 80% of cases and infectious complications are common (bacterial). Patients with the rarer C1r and C1s deficiency may have glomerular disease or an SLE-like disease process. Interestingly, they typically have elevated levels of C2, C3, and C4. A renal biopsy would not be indicated for the child in the vignette because the probability of finding treatable disease is minimal. Although hypercalciuria is associated with microscopic hematuria, her screening test result was negative and she had no family history of kidney stones. Thus, a 24-hour urine test is likely of little benefit. Assessment of antinuclear antibody (ANA) by the Hep-2 assay in children has a high rate of false positivity (defined as a positive test without any other evidence of SLE). In the face of no symptoms, no inflammatory marker elevations, a negative family history, and a normal C3, the probability of a positive ANA Hep- 2 assay being associated with the disease findings and confirmed by a tissue ANA assay or being associated with a positive anti -double-stranded DNA is very low.

      "renal blood flow will be maintained through efferent arteriole dilation The kidneys autoregulate renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate to maintain their crucial functions relatively constantly across a wide spectrum of mean arterial pressures. This can be achieved via 2 mechanisms, myogenic mechanism and tubuloglomerular feedback. The myogenic mechanism works through vasodilators, nitric oxide and prostaglandin 2 (PGI2, or prostacyclin), and a potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin. Nitric oxide and PGI2 synthesis is stimulated by shear force, whereas endothelin is released in response to stretch. When blood pressure decreases within the physiologic ranges of autoregulation, the blood vessel diameter decreases, resulting in an increase of shear stress on the 8/24/2019 http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/july?req=20 1908241 159415878 &sta... July | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 3 endothelium. Nitric oxide and PGI2 are stimulated, resulting in vasodilation. At the level of the afferent arteriole of the glomerulus, this helps to acutely preserve renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate during times of hypovolemia or lower blood pressure. Conversely, with an acute increase in blood pressure, this stretch would cause an increase in blood vessel diameter. This stimulates the release of endothelin, which contracts the smooth muscle and returns vessel diameter to normal. In the renal circulation at the afferent arteriole, therefore, this minimizes an increase of renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate in the setting of an acute increase in blood pressure. Tubuloglomerular feedback also maintains renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in a stable range during times of acute blood pressure changes. For example, for the patient in the vignette, the acute decrease in blood pressure would lead to a decreased delivery of solute, particularly chloride, to the juxtaglomerular apparatus as monitored by the macula densa. This leads to vasodilation at the afferent arteriole (also part of the juxtaglomerular apparatus) to preserve and maintain renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate at a relatively constant rate. Concurrently, other responses will take effect to preserve perfusion to vital organs. This includes vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation, stimulation of renin by the juxtaglomerular apparatus, and stimulation of antidiuretic hormone. Hemodynamic and hydrostatic changes affecting the Starling forces, and regulation of renal tubular transporters will stimulate sodium and water reabsorption at the proximal convoluted tubule and along the nephron to maintain circulating volume, organ perfusion, and blood pressure at acceptable levels. Therefore, for the girl in the vignette, autoregulation by dilation of the afferent arteriole will try to maintain her glomerular filtration rate in a relatively steady state. This will be true as well for her renal blood flow, because autoregulatory mechanisms work primarily through the afferent, not the efferent, arteriole. Renal clearance of sodium will be decreased in this situation, rather than increased, and conversely, antidiuretic hormone will be stimulated, not suppressed.

The serum calcium is generous and 25-vitamin D is within the acceptable range. The pretransplant 1,25-vitamin D level was low. The patient is currently complaining of muscle weakness, which is a symptom of hypophosphatemia. In this scenario, the best choice would be to give phosphate supplements, along with calcitriol and cinacalcet. Calcitriol will increase gastrointestinal absorption of phosphate and calcium. In addition, calcitriol will also aid in suppressing parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Because the pretransplant PTH levels were significantly elevated and will take months to 1 year to normalize, addition of cinacalcet will help in the correction of secondary hyperparathyroidism and also prevent hypercalcemia from calcitriol. Because 25-vitamin D levels are within the normal range, addition of cholecalciferol will not help in the correction of hypophosphatemia. Increasing dietary intake of organic phosphate, although useful, is not sufficient on its own, without phosphate supplements. Dysregulated phosphate homeostasis is commonly seen in the late stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). As the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases, phosphate excretion decreases, which causes an increase in serum phosphorus levels. To avoid hyperphosphatemia, FGF23 levels increase and elevated FGF23 levels have been shown to be early biomarkers of chronic kidney disease. FGF23 levels are elevated when the GFR is less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 even when PTH and serum phosphorus levels are within the normal range. FGF23 promotes phosphaturia and decreases circulating levels of 1,25-vitamin D, the active form of vitamin D. 1,25-Vitamin D promotes phosphate absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Lower levels of 1,25-vitamin D in CKD will thus decrease phosphate absorption. As CKD advances, secondary hyperparathyroidism becomes evident. One of the major stimuli for elevated FGF23 and PTH levels is hyperphosphatemia. Lower 1,25-vitamin D levels contribute to secondary hyperparathyroidism. In the early stages of CKD, the changes in mineral metabolism markers aim at maximizing phosphaturia while decreasing phosphate absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. However, in advanced stages of CKD, secondary hyperparathyroidism and elevated FGF23 levels are unable to maintain serum phosphorus levels in the normal range, and patients develop hyperphosphatemia. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/july2req=201908241211492455 8/24/2019 July | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 6 When a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with secondary hyperparathyroidism, and elevated FGF23 levels receives a functioning kidney transplant, the transplanted kidney is now able to excrete phosphate in the presence of the phosphaturic hormones (FGF23 and PTH). This is one of the key reasons for hypophosphatemia after kidney transplantation. Hypophosphatemia is commonly (~90%) seen in patients in the early post -kidney transplantation period (3 months). Glucocorticoids have been shown to be phosphaturic, but likely play a small role in causing hypophosphatemia in kidney transplant recipients. Other immunosuppressive medications like cyclosporine and rapamycin have been shown to cause hypophosphatemia in animal models but their contribution to hypophosphatemia in patients with renal transplants is unclear. Of interest, patients receiving the same immunosuppressive medications for non-kidney transplantation causes do not demonstrate hypophosphatemia. Levels of FGF23 decrease rapidly after transplantation and are comparable with levels in patients with CKD of similar GFR 1 year after receiving the transplant. Serum PTH levels also decrease after transplantation, but the degree of decrease is slower than that of FGF23 and the levels at 1 year after transplantation remain higher than patients with CKD with comparable GFRs. 1,25-Vitamin D levels increase by 3 months after transplantation and are comparable with their CKD counterparts. Fractional excretion of phosphorus also is comparable with their CKD counterparts at 1 year after transplantation, whereas at 3 months, it is slightly higher. In general, hypophosphatemia after transplantation improves and normalizes by 1 year after transplantation. Symptoms of severe hypophosphatemia include muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, respiratory failure, and impaired myocardial function. To avoid complications, treatment of post-transplantation hypophosphatemia is important. Oral phosphate supplements and increased dietary intake of organic sources of phosphate (meat and dairy products) are important in the management of hypophosphatemia. Potential complications of phosphate supplements are diarrhea and worsening of secondary hyperparathyroidism. In addition, high doses of phosphate http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/july2req=201908241211492455 8/24/2019 July | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 5 of 6 supplements can cause nephrocalcinosis, and therefore, the dose of phosphate supplements should be judiciously monitored, along with serum phosphorus levels. Persistent post-transplant hyperparathyroidism causes hypophosphatemia and can have detrimental effects on the bone. Thus, addition of calcitriol and cinacalcet are useful in these patients to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, one has to be watchful of hypercalcemia associated with calcitriol and hypocalcemia associated with cinacalcet. Cinacalcet is usually is used for shorter duration and renal function should be closely monitored during treatment. Kidney Diseases Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend at least weekly measurement of phosphorus and calcium in the immediate post-transplant period. After the immediate post-transplantation period, frequency of measurement of calcium, phosphorus, and PTH levels should be determined by the degree of abnormality of these markers and the need for phosphate supplements, calcitriol, and cinacalcet.

Renal ultrasonography revealed bilateral nephromegaly and increased echogenicity in the absence of cysts. Liver ultrasonography showed an enlarged echogenic liver. The constellation of findings described in the vignette, combined with a negative family history of cystic kidney disease, is highly suggestive of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). However, other causes of bilateral nephromegaly should be considered. Neonates with ARPKD fall into 3 clinical categories: those with severe renal involvement but mild liver involvement, those with mild renal disease and severe liver involvement (ie, hepatic fibrosis and dilated biliary ducts—Caroli disease), and those with moderate involvement of both kidney and liver. Affected neonates with severe neonatal onset may suffer from Potter facies, pulmonary hypoplasia, and club feet. These patients have a 30% mortality incidence. Initiation of renal replacement therapy should therefore be decided on an individual basis depending primarily on pulmonary maturity. The presence or absence of oligohydramnios per se is not predictive of the severity of renal or pulmonary involvement. The initial neonatal period may be accompanied by oliguria, especially in patients with respiratory distress. Once lung function has improved, the patients are at risk for hypernatremia because of defects in urinary concentrating capacity and polyuria. Neonates with ARPKD are commonly hypertensive as well. Although ARPKD was once known as a genetically homogeneous disease secondary to PKHD7 mutations, an identical phenotype can occur as a result of mutations in the DZIP1L gene, which have been reported in 7 children from 4 unrelated consanguineous families. Glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD) caused by mutations in the HVF7b gene may present initially with bilaterally enlarged and echogenic kidneys with or without liver involvement. However, this is an autosomal dominant disorder and a positive family history of maturity-onset diabetes of the young and renal disease is frequently present. http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/july?req=20 190824 1209096046 8/24/2019 July | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) may present in the neonatal period; however, these neonates usually manifest ultrasonographically visible renal cysts and a positive family history in the parents or grandparents. Liver or pancreatic cysts are also more suggestive of ADPKD. Nephronophthisis is a heterogeneous autosomal recessive ciliopathy leading to cystic kidney disease with extrarenal manifestations, and usually presents later in infancy/childhood with chronic kidney disease, polyuria, disproportionate anemia, normal or enlarged kidneys, and cysts in the corticomedullary junction. In cases where the family history is not informative or the clinical presentation is atypical, genetic testing may be required for accurate diagnosis.

These features are highly indicative of neoplasia and a referral to pediatric urology is the preferred next step. A renal cyst biopsy is not indicated because of the risk of spreading malignant cells. Given the relatively high risk of malignancy, it is not advisable to wait 1 year for repeat ultrasonography. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/august?req=20 190824 1233537014&... 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 3 Although gross hematuria and/or unilateral or bilateral flank pain are usually the most common presenting complaints, the presence of ACKD should be suspected when 4 or more cysts are detected in a patient without a history of congenital cystic kidney disease. The most serious complication of ACKD is renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In a study of 6,561 adult kidney transplant recipients, RCC was more prevalent in patients with ACKD (19%) than in patients without ACKD (0.5%). If the renal cysts are complex, as in this patient (abnormal nodular or thick walls, thick septae, echoic content), the prevalence of RCC increases to more than 50%. Native kidneys can develop ACKD after many years of dialysis and even after renal transplantation. Interestingly, the type of immunosuppression used has no effect on the prevalence of RCC. Studies performed in children with ACKD revealed that the incidence of RCC ranges between 0% and 8%; however, these studies suffer from short-term follow-up and small number of patients. Mattoo et al reported the occurrence of RCC in 2 of 24 children and young adults (8%) who were receiving maintenance dialysis and were followed for up to 10 years. Both patients had ACKD. Clearly, prospective studies are needed to address the true prevalence of ACKD and RCC in children. It should be noted that RCC in adult patients with end-stage renal disease who are receiving dialysis tends to be less invasive, smaller, less symptomatic, and diagnosed earlier than the rest of the RCC population. There are also reports of regression of ACKD in patients after successful renal transplantation. Although studies related to the prognosis of childhood ACKD-associated RCC are very limited, all 5 children and young adults diagnosed with RCC reported in the literature have had long-term tumor-free survival after surgery.

      "uric acid Under normal physiologic circumstances, the skin produces vitamin D3 or is ingested in the diet. Vitamin D is then converted to 25(OH)vitamin D (known as calcidiol) by the liver. This also represents the storage form of vitamin D. Renal tubular cells convert this to 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D (calcitriol) via the enzyme 1a-hydroxylase. Calcitriol has a number of biological actions. First, calcitriol stimulates intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorous. Calcitriol also increases renal calcium reabsorption. At the level of the parathyroid gland, calcitriol suppresses parathyroid hormone secretion. Finally, calcitriol acts on both osteoblasts and osteoclasts and leads to bone resorption via osteoclastic activity. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/august?req=201908241216518243&... 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 3 The patient in the vignette has sarcoidosis and a kidney stone. Granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis are associated with hypercalcemia, which can in turn, lead to hypercalciuria and increased stone risk. The mechanism of hypercalcemia is associated with vitamin D metabolism and physiology. Activated pulmonary monocytes/macrophages in granulomas produce 1a-hydroxylase. Serum levels of calcitriol then increase above normal levels. Patients then experience increased serum calcium levels secondary to all the mechanisms of action of calcitriol listed before. Patients with granulomatous diseases with hypercalcemia often experience symptoms of hypercalcemia such as bone pain, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, constipation), and neurologic manifestations. In the kidney, nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis can occur from chronic hypercalcemia. This can lead to concentrating defects and subsequent complications from polyuria. It is not known whether chronic volume contraction leads to nephrolithiasis risk as seen in patients with chronically concentrated urine who have increased stone risk. Although malignancy and granulomatous diseases can lead to endogenous vitamin D toxicity through the mechanisms listed before, some patients can develop similar symptoms from exogenous vitamin D overdosing. This can occur through excessive use of medications such as ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol. Rare congenital disorders can lead to excessive production of both calcidiol and calcitriol. In summary, the differential diagnoses listed above need to be considered in patients who exhibit signs of hypervitaminosis D. Patients with granulomatous disease are at risk for hypervitaminosis D and subsequent kidney stones from hypercalcemia. Because monocyte/macrophages have increased 1a-hydroxylase activity, patients have elevated serum levels of 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D. The enzyme activity is downstream of 25(OH) vitamin D production, thus levels of calcidiol should not be elevated. The elevated levels of calcitriol and hypercalcemia should lead to appropriately suppressed, not elevated, levels of parathyroid hormones. Finally, patients with granulomatous disease do not have an increased risk for uric acid stones. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/august?req=201908241216518243&... 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 3 PREP Pearls + In granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, activated pulmonary monocytes/macrophages produce 1a-hydroxylase and can lead to hypervitaminosis D. + Hypercalcemia is linked to nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis and should be explored in patients with these conditions.

In children, the onus of following the complex treatment regimen falls on the primary caregiver(s). These formidable responsibilities put strain on a family’s resources, which in turn, directly affects the care a patient receives. http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/august?req=201908241219413871&... 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 2 of 4 The term “noncompliance,” defined as the extent to which a patient's behavior is in accordance with physicians’ recommendation and advice, should not be used for characterizing a patient. The usage of this term emphasizes an authoritarian relationship between physicians and patients and underscores a passive role for patients in the treatment process. Recently, terms like “adherence,” “ alliance,” and “concordance” are recommended to characterize patient behavior in response to recommendations of the medical team. These terms underscore a mutually accepting physician-patient relationship with active participation by patients (caregivers) and point toward the multiple complex processes underlying the patient or their caregiver's approach to decisions patient cooperation,” “therapeutic regarding medical care. Average nonadherence rate has been reported to be 40% (range 17%-40%) in pediatric patients receiving dialysis. Various patient, family, and illness characteristics have been associated with adherence in pediatric patients receiving dialysis. Family characteristics such as single-caregiver households and low socioeconomic status, as described for the patient in the vignette, have been associated with increased risk for nonadherence. In these families, there is increased risk for lack of parental supervision in following recommendations for diet, fluid, and medication regimens and access to food consistent with the necessary dietary restrictions. Patient and caregivers’ psychological adjustment to the diagnosis of a lifelong illness is an important determinant of adherence. Stress, depression, anxiety, and other extreme reactions to the diagnosis and various treatment requirements have been associated with poor adherence. In the pediatric population, older age, longer duration of dialysis, recurrent hospitalizations, and coexisting morbidities have also been associated with increased risk for medical nonadherence. Increased autonomy, expectation of greater responsibility of personal medical requirements, and challenges of transition to adult care are factors linked with poor adherence in older children and adolescents. A single study (n=22) reported higher rates of adherence to hemodialysis (HD) compared with peritoneal dialysis (PD), but the differences were not statistically significant. Although this could be partially related to medications received at the time of HD treatments, it is important to note that currently there is no gold standard to evaluate http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/august?req=201908241219413871&... 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 nonadherence. Therefore, future studies with larger number of patients are needed for establishing the influence of dialysis modality (HD vs PD) on patient adherence. Currently, PD is, and should continue to be, the preferred initial dialysis modality in children with end-stage renal disease, whenever possible. Age, dialysis duration, frequency of hospitalization, and dialysis modality are not risk factors for nonadherence in this patient. Physiologic, behavioral, and subjective assessments provide treating physicians estimates of nonadherence because there is no single standard to reliably evaluate nonadherence in different patients. Physiologic parameters providing clues to adherence include laboratory evaluation, interdialytic fluid gains, and patient growth with treatment. Although these are objective measures, there are no acceptable cutoffs to distinguish adherence from nonadherence. Furthermore, variables such as residual renal function, medications, dialysis adequacy, and caregiver-maintained home records influence the results of these objective measures. Behavioral measures include attendance at clinic appointments and time spent in undergoing dialysis. Although these are not influenced by other variables, similar to physiologic measures, there are no acceptable cutoffs for adherence versus nonadherence. Assessment of the patient's inventory and use of dialysis supplies (time consuming and resource intensive), and treatments provided by a review of caregiver-maintained home records and/or records from an electronic smart media card stored in the home machine provide the medical team information about home PD therapy. Another newly available system allows health care providers to securely view their patients’ home dialysis-related data that are automatically collected and uploaded to a computerized platform. This provides not only an objective and accurate measure of adherence but also information regarding the need for adjusting the dialysis prescription, which can be done remotely by the medical team without a clinic visit. Subjective measures include reports by the patient, caregivers, and medical team (dialysis nurses, coordinators, social workers, dietician, and physician). Subjective measures provide a comprehensive assessment of adherence; however, in addition to recall and reporting bias, they are also influenced by the rapport among the patient, caregiver, and the medical team. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/august?req=201908241219413871&... 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 4 PREP Pearls + Family characteristics such as single-caregiver households and low socioeconomic status have been associated with increased risk for nonadherence. + Teenage, longer duration of dialysis, recurrent hospitalizations, and coexisting morbidities have also been associated with increased risk for medical nonadherence. + Physiologic, behavioral, and subjective assessments provide estimates of nonadherence because currently there is no reliable single standard.

This relatively more severe form of PTLD requires aggressive management strategies to save the patient's life. Such strategies can include major reduction (even discontinuation) of his immunosuppressive regimen, initiation of anti-B cell antibodies such as rituximab, and even early chemotherapy, particularly in PTLD of the central nervous system. The risk of immunosuppressive agent discontinuation is the development of rebound acute rejection in the allograft. In many cases, such acute rejections do not occur early after PTLD development/treatment, perhaps because the patient is already overimmunosuppressed and because the chemotherapy may also suppress the immune system. However, such a statement is not absolute; acute rejection can occur in the early treatment phase of PTLD. We cannot currently predict at the time of PTLD diagnosis as to who will or will not develop acute rejection during PTLD treatment. There are not many situations in which treatment of acute rejection in the face of allograft dysfunction is withheld. The presence of a life-threatening cancer is one such situation. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is by far the predominant cancer in children with a kidney transplant. Saving the patient's life takes precedence over saving the allograft, with dialysis as the fallback option for renal replacement therapy. For the patient in the vignette, treating the acute rejection with polyclonal antithymocyte globulin risks making the PTLD worse and would not be recommended. Plasmapheresis might be indicated in pure antibody-mediated or mixed acute rejection. Here the rejection is cellular mediated only by pathology. Plasmapheresis may also remove some of the needed PTLD medications, and for these 2 reasons, would not be appropriate in this context. Performing an allograft nephrectomy might be indicated if the allograft had shown evidence of intragraft PTLD, but that is not the case here. It is not needed for a grade 2A acute rejection. Many clinical situations do not fall into such absolute distinctions as presented in the vignette. Therapeutic options for acute rejection that may be reasonable to use because of dual benefit could include intravenous http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/august?req=201908241223101220&... 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 4 immune globulin, which can treat acute rejection and also contain Epstein- Barr virus (EBV)-directed antibodies, or rituximab, which lyses EBV-infected pre-B cells and has some benefit in steroid-resistant acute rejection to diminish the B helper cell contribution. Steroid pulses are often part of the chemotherapy regimens for PTLD and an additional pulse might be used to partially treat the acute rejection. However, the patient will still remain at risk for allograft loss. Other possible situations in which allograft rejection therapy might be withheld or delayed are: * Other types of life-threatening cancers (eg, advanced skin cancer, native kidney cancer) or active systemic infection Interstitial inflammation when the inflammation is suspected to be from the BK virus Surveillance biopsies, where borderline or suspicious acute rejection might be present (controversial to treat in this situation) Kidneys with severe irreversible chronic changes on biopsy PREP Pearls + Saving the patient's life takes precedence over saving the kidney allograft. + Active life-threatening cancer or systemic infection are among the situations in which allograft rejection therapy might be withheld or delayed.

When urinary protein excretion is severe, exceeding 1,000 mg/m* or greater, or more than 40 mg/m per hour in adults and children, respectively, this is considered to be in the “nephrotic range.” Knowing that it is difficult to obtain a 24-hour urine collection, spot assessments of urinary protein and http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/august?req=20 190824 1235294047 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 creatinine reported as a ratio are often used instead. Abnormal protein excretion is signified by a urine protein-creatinine ratio of 0.2 (mg/mg) or greater in children older than 2 years (=0.5 in children 6-24 months of age), and nephrotic range proteinuria is signified by a ratio of 2.0 or greater. Often, proteinuria is initially detected via a urinary dipstick, which measures the concentration of albumin in the urine. Many exposures can lead to a false- positive urine dipstick test result for protein (concentrated urine, alkalotic urine, gross hematuria, cephalosporins, radiocontrast agents, tolbutamide, vasopressor agents). In addition, several scenarios can cause proteinuria when there is no occult renal disease (excessive exercise, fever, ambulation [particularly in adolescence], and dehydration). Because of this, when proteinuria is detected via dipstick, it is essential to quantify the amount (by a 24-hour urine collection or a spot urine protein-creatinine ratio) and to repeat the testing in ideal conditions. This will allow for confirmation of the presence of proteinuria and for an understanding of the amount of protein excreted daily. To do so, one should repeat the urine test when the child is afebrile and well hydrated, after a period of rest in very competitive athletes, and after at least 8 hours of lying flat (ie, first-morning urine). When obtaining a first- morning urine specimen, it is important to emphasize the need to void before going to bed and the need to void immediately on waking (avoiding a prolonged period of ambulation before providing the first-morning urine specimen). With this in mind, obtaining a first-morning urine specimen for a urine protein- creatinine ratio is the most appropriate first step when evaluating the adolescent in the vignette, in addition to microscopy. If this testing confirms the presence of proteinuria, then she should undergo an evaluation that includes laboratory testing (which might include a comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood cell counts, lipids, complement C3 and C4, antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA, hepatitis B and hepatitis C serologies, and HIV testing) and imaging (renal ultrasonography). Further testing can be determined based on the results of this initial testing. Although the other response choices may ultimately be performed to appropriately evaluate and treat this patient, because of the multiple potential causes of persistent proteinuria (Table), the first step should be to confirm the presence of proteinuria with a first-morning urine for protein-creatinine ratio. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/august?req=20 190824 1235294047 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 If the first-morning urine specimen is negative for protein, then the initial positive urine test may have been because of transient proteinuria (examples detailed before) or orthostatic proteinuria, which is particularly common during adolescence. Orthostatic proteinuria describes the phenomenon of increased urinary protein excretion when upright, with normal urinary protein excretion when recumbent. It is a common cause of proteinuria, explaining more than half of the cases of proteinuria in children. It is particularly common in adolescence. PREP Pearls + Urinary protein excretion is abnormal when it is more than 150 mg per 24 hours in adults, 4 mg/m2 per hour in children, or when the spot urine protein-creatinine ratio is greater than or equal to 0.2 in children older than 2 years (20.5 in children 6-24 months of age). + When proteinuria is detected by dipstick, it is essential to quantify the amount (by a 24-hour urine collection or a spot urine protein-creatinine ratio) and to repeat the testing in ideal conditions to rule out orthostatic proteinuria and transient, benign causes of proteinuria such as excessive exercise, fever, ambulation (particularly in adolescence), and dehydration.

      "Liddle syndrome The patient in the vignette has low renin hypertension and hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. In low renin hypertension, the plasma potassium and serum aldosterone levels help differentiate underlying causes (Monticone S, et al). Among the causes of low renin HTN, Liddle syndrome presents with hypertension, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with low renin and low aldosterone, making this the preferred response. Gordon syndrome can be caused by autosomal dominant WNK7 or WNK4 mutations, or autosomal recessive CUL3 or KLHL3 mutations—all of which lead to increased sodium chloride cotransporter sodium reabsorption. Like Liddle syndrome, Gordon syndrome presents with low renin and low aldosterone hypertension. However, unlike Liddle, Gordon syndrome presents with Ayperkalemic metabolic acidosis. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) can also present with hypertension, hypokalemia, low renin, and low aldosterone. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess is caused by impaired activity of 11B- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11B-HSD2). 11B-HSD2 converts active cortisol into inactive cortisone; the excess cortisol activates the mineralocorticoid receptor to cause the hypertension and electrolyte changes. Patients with AME have decreased (not normal, as in the vignette) http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/august?req=20 190824 1232037637 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 3 of 5 urinary free cortisone to cortisol ratios. Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism (PH) exhibit low renin hypertension but have elevated—not low—serum aldosterone. Renin can be measured in multiple ways. The traditional method is by means of plasma renin activity (PRA): PRA is a radioimmunoassay measuring angiotensin 1 generation as a function of time. Newly available alternatives include direct renin concentration (DRC) measured using chemiluminescence or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Low renin is defined as PRA less than 0.65 ng/mL per hour or a DRC less than 15 wU/mL. As stated herein, primary hyperaldosteronism presents with hypertension with low renin but high or normal serum aldosterone. Primary hyperaldosteronism is suggested by an aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) greater than 30 ( when aldosterone is measured in nanograms per deciliter and PRA in nanograms per milliliter per hour). If using DRC, PH is suggested by an ARR ratio of 3.7. Sporadic PH may be identified in up to 6% of adults with hypertension, but is less common in children. However, there are 4 familial forms of PH, which are all autosomal dominant and may have early onset: * Type 1 (also known as glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism) is caused by recombination between CYP77B87 and CYP717B2 genes; this leads to a chimeric enzyme that synthesizes aldosterone under the control of ACTH. Type 1 is associated with severe early-onset hypertension and high risk of stroke/cerebrovascular events at a young age (<40 years). * Type 2 is caused by CLCN2 (encoding chloride channel CIC-2) mutations; in the adrenal zona glomerulosa, this upregulates CYP7782 expression. * Type 3 is caused by KC/N5 mutations; affected patients present with PH at a very young age and have extremely severe hypertension often requiring bilateral adrenalectomy to control blood pressure. * Type 4 is caused by germline CACNA7H (encoding for a T-type calcium channel Cav3.2) mutations; This form is very rare. The patient in the vignette has hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis in addition to hypertension. The differential diagnosis for hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis includes several genetic diseases. These include: http://2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org/script/august?req=20 190824 1232037637 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 4 of 5 + Liddle syndrome (activating autosomal dominant mutations in SCNVN7A, SCNN1B, or SCNN7G (all encode components of the ENaC channel) + Bartter syndrome (including autosomal recessive mutations in SLC72A7 [encodes NaKCC2 cotransporter], KC/N7 [encodes ROMK channel], CLCNKB [encodes ClcKb channel], and BSND [encodes Barttin]) + Bartter-like syndromes (activating calcium sensing receptor [CASR] mutations leading to hypocalcemia with Bartter-like syndrome; MAGED2 mutations are associated with X-linked polyhydramnios with a transient Bartter-like syndrome); * Gitelman syndrome (autosomal recessive mutations in SLC72A3, that encodes for the sodium chloride cotransporter). Of these, only Liddle syndrome is associated with hypertension; blood pressure will be low or normal in the other conditions. As indicated before, Liddle syndrome is caused by autosomal dominant activation of the ENaC channel (Figure). It can be caused by mutations in any of ENaC’s 3 homologous subunits, a, B, and y. Most Liddle syndrome mutations affect PY motifs in the C-terminus of the ENaC subunits, leading to impaired apical membrane internalization and degradation by a ubiquitin ligase NEDD-4, The activated ENaC channel drives sodium reabsorption. In exchange for sodium reabsorption, excessive hydrogen ion and potassium excretion is in excess, resulting in hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Increased sodium reabsorption suppresses renin and aldosterone. The preferred treatment for Liddle syndrome is a low sodium diet and direct ENaC inhibitors, including the potassium-sparing diuretics amiloride or triamterene. Potential complications of both include hyperkalemia. Of note, Liddle syndrome will NOT respond to spironolactone. The Table lists some of the typical characteristics of Liddle syndrome. PREP Pearls + Liddle syndrome presents with low renin hypertension and hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. + Liddle syndrome results from autosomal dominant genetic defects in ENaC subunits SCVN7A, SCNN7B, or SCNNIG. + Preferred treatment for Liddle syndrome is with direct ENaC antagonists. http://2019.prepnephrology.cours ap.org/script/august?req=20 190824 1232037637 8/24/2019 August | 2019.prepnephrology.courses.aap.org Page 5 of 5 ABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area + Know the clinical and laboratory features of Liddle syndrome + Know the treatment and the complications of treatment for Liddle syndrome Suggested Readings Monticone S, Losano |, Tetti M, Buffolo F, Veglio F, Mulatero P.

      "his risk of hypertension is related to the rate of rise of hemoglobin",
      "his risk of seizures is increased independent of his blood pressure The patient in the vignette has anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), a common condition. The important causes of anemia with CKD include iron deficiency and deficiency or hyporesponsiveness to endogenous erythropoietin. Before the availability of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in the 1980s, patients with CKD who had anemia were treated with frequent red blood cell transfusions. This therapy was fraught with complications such as antigen exposure/sensitization, bloodborne infections, iron overload, fluid overload, and hyperkalemia. The modern-day approach to addressing the anemia in a patient with CKD involves iron therapy and ESAs. One must consider the indications, challenges associated with administration, and potential complications associated with each of these therapeutic agents. The absolute cutoffs for defining iron deficiency differ between studies and guidelines. Generally, iron therapy should be given when transferrin saturation (TSAT) is less than 20% to 25% and ferritin is less than 100 ng/mL. Iron therapy can be considered in anemic patients with a TSAT less than 30%. lron therapy can be administered enterally or parenterally. For patients with CKD not receiving dialysis, the best route for iron replacement is not clear. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines do not suggest one route over another. Oral iron is convenient, safe, inexpensive, and has a limited side effect profile. The most common side effects of oral iron are gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, dark stools, and abdominal pain. Intravenous iron, although more effective, has a larger side effect profile that raises concerns for its use. Although different study results have conflicting conclusions, some studies have demonstrated that intravenous iron use is associated with an increased risk of anaphylaxis, bacterial bloodstream infections, and cardiovascular events secondary to atherosclerosis. Studies are further limited for comparison because of the different forms of intravenous iron including iron sucrose, iron dextran, and iron gluconate. A recent meta-analysis by Shepshelovich et al concluded that the hemoglobin response was better with intravenous iron but it did not decrease the need for ESA dosage increases or blood transfusions compared with oral iron. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents have revolutionized the treatment of CKD- associated anemia. Two ESAs that are available for use are erythropoietin and darbepoetin. Their efficacy and side effect profile are similar in children. For children who are not receiving hemodialysis, subcutaneous administration is needed for ESAs. As with any subcutaneous injection, this can be challenging in younger patients. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are otherwise well tolerated. In certain studies, patients reported more pain with darbepoetin than with erythropoietin. Complications in nondialysis patients with CKD-associated anemia taking ESAs are similar to those receiving dialysis who have anemia and are taking ESAs. In adults, multiple studies have demonstrated an increased incidence of adverse outcomes and death (myocardial infarction, stroke, etc) when targeting a hemoglobin concentration greater than 13 g/dL (130 g/L). Multiple studies have also demonstrated that targeting higher hemoglobin levels increases the risk of malignancy. Thus, most centers target hemoglobin levels of 10.0 to 11.5 g/dL (100- 115 g/L). Hypertension is another complication of ESAs, and evidence suggests that this is related to ESA dosing and the rapidity of hemoglobin level increase. By targeting lower hemoglobin levels and slowly increasing hemoglobin levels, the risk of hypertension can be significantly lowered as was shown in the CREATE Trial. Multiple meta-analyses have supported this notion. Historically ESAs were thought to be associated with a higher risk of seizures, but evidence-based approaches do not correlate increased seizure risk in normotensive patients taking ESAs. For this vignette, the patient is going to initiate ESA therapy. The patient is iron sufficient with TSAT of 33% (100/300 x 100). Patients receiving dialysis who are taking ESAs have a higher risk of thrombosis compared with patients with CKD who are not receiving dialysis. Evidence supports that higher target hemoglobin levels are associated with higher incidence of death and cardiovascular events. As discussed before, the risk of seizures does not seem to be associated with the higher hemoglobin levels, but are more associated with hypertensive events. Blood pressure should be monitored even in those patients with lower hemoglobin levels when starting an ESA. The risk of hypertension can be dramatically reduced by not starting ESA at a high dose. PREP Pearls + At higher target hemoglobin levels, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular events. * The risk of hypertension associated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents is independent of the hemoglobin level. + The risk of seizures with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents is more closely associated with hypertensive encephalopathy rather than the medication itself.

      "progressive non-PIGN hypocomplementemic glomerular disease",
      "scale malfunction A markedly decreased C3 complement level in the setting of acute glomerulonephritis (hematuria, hypertension, edema) after an intercurrent illness strongly suggests postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN). Postinfectious glomerulonephritis often comes with red blood cell casts on urine microscopy and an elevation of serum creatinine, but so do many other types of acute glomerulonephritis. An elevated anti-streptolysin O titer merely indicates a history of streptococcal infection, whereas PIGN may also occur after other nonstreptococcal infections. This makes the use of the term “poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis” for PIGN inaccurate. Although low C3 complement levels in the appropriate clinical setting can be strongly indicative of PIGN, other glomerular diseases can also be accompanied by decreased C3 complement levels. Such primary hypocomplementemic glomerulonephritides include the spectrum of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, C3 glomerulonephritis, and renal involvement in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome as well as shunt nephritis, whereas secondary glomerular disease with decreased C3 and C4 levels is often seen in systemic lupus erythematosus with renal involvement (lupus nephritis). Postinfectious glomerulonephritis typically requires only supportive care with fluid and dietary sodium restriction. For those with fluid overload, a diuretic such as furosemide is helpful. Additional antihypertensive medication may be needed in patients with severe hypertension, particularly if the response to diuretic and fluid restriction is poor. Dialysis may be needed in severe cases with fluid overload and electrolyte anomalies. Usually PIGN resolves on its own and without specific treatment such as aggressive immunosuppression. In contrast, other hypocomplementemic conditions benefit from such immunosuppressive treatments that may include steroid regimens, cytotoxic and antiproliferative drugs such as cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil, or complement blockade. Antihypertensive and/or diuretic therapy for PIGN is usually only needed for a limited period because the underlying condition is self-limited and usually recovers spontaneously. Continuation of such therapy into the recovery phase of the disease can therefore lead to overtreatment and diuretic-induced dehydration and hypokalemia, both of which can manifest clinically with weakness as seen in the child in the vignette. Decreased appetite is very unlikely to cause this much weight loss in such a short period. The history and clinical course in this patient are not consistent with a progressive non-PIGN hypocomplementemic glomerular disease, Scale malfunction could explain the weight difference but not the weakness in the patient. PREP Pearls + The diagnostic hallmark of postinfectious glomerulonephritis is a decreased serum complement C3 level in the usual clinical context of acute glomerulonephritis after an infectious illness. + Treatment for postinfectious glomerulonephritis is usually supportive, and may include diuretic and/or antihypertensive therapy. + The prognosis of postinfectious glomerulonephritis is usually excellent, with the vast majority of affected patients usually recovering.

      "voiding cystourethrography The infant in the vignette has a unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK). The diagnosis is based on characteristic prenatal and postnatal renal ultrasonography findings of large noncommunicating renal cysts (Figure). More boys than girls are affected by MCDK and it is more common in the left kidney. The routine use of high-resolution fetal ultrasonography has led to prenatal identification in most MCDK cases. In a few cases, the newborn has a palpable abdominal mass. There has been a debate in the literature about whether voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) or nuclear scintigraphy should be performed in these infants. Meta-analysis of large cohorts of children born with MCDK has revealed that although contralateral renal abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) are found in 10% to 14% of patients, the vast majority with significant VUR will also manifest hydronephrosis. Also, studies have shown that VUR is low-grade (sgrade Ill) and resolves spontaneously. Accordingly, the consensus is that VCUG is indicated in the presence of contralateral hydronephrosis or a documented urinary tract infection. Although lack of blood flow on nuclear scintigraphy confirms the diagnosis of MCDK, it is not required for a diagnosis. If a renal flow scan must be performed, it is recommended to wait until 1 month of age when renal blood flow has “physiologically” increased. Longitudinal follow-up studies of infants with unilateral MCDK have shown that the incidence of malignancy (eg, Wilms tumor/nephroblastoma) is extremely low—in fact, some studies suggest that it is below the incidence in the general population —and therefore, prophylactic surgical resection of the MCDK is not recommended. Conservative clinical and radiologic follow-up for the infant with MCDK with periodic blood pressure, renal ultrasonography, and urinalysis is indicated for the following reasons: + Although the incidence of hypertension in MCDK disease 5 or 10 years after diagnosis is similar to that in the general population, few studies have found a slightly increased risk of blood pressure higher than the 95th percentile on follow-up. Although renal ultrasonography may indicate that the contralateral kidney is normal in appearance and is undergoing appropriate compensatory hypertrophy, monitoring for proteinuria is warranted, especially in infants with hypertension. Periodic renal ultrasonography is indicated in patients with MCDK; some authors have recommended ultrasonography at birth and at 2, 5, and 10 years of age to document the involution of the MCDK kidney (60% will involute by 3-5 years) and compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney. * Periodic measurements of serum creatinine may be considered because some studies have found that up to 30% of children with MCDK and compensatory contralateral hypertrophy have a mild degree of renal impairment (CKD stage 2). PREP Pearls + Renal ultrasonography is the main diagnostic imaging modality to detect and monitor the course of multicystic dysplastic kidney disease. + Voiding cystourethrography is not indicated in multicystic dysplastic kidney disease unless hydronephrosis is detected on renal ultrasonography, or confirmed urinary tract infections develop. + Renal Scintigraphy may be useful in uncertain cases, such as suspected ureteropelvic junction obstruction.

      "enuresis is likely to be related to WBS hypertension at her age is more common than nephrourologic anomalies or symptoms nephrocalcinosis is the most common renal abnormality she is at higher risk for delayed puberty An uncomplicated pyelonephritis in a 7-year-old girl would normally only warrant initial renal ultrasonography. However, in patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a number of urologic and renal anomalies have been described that may lead to further workup. About half of the patients will have voiding symptoms, and in a recent study, the bladder capacity was about 70% of that expected, and that was thought to be because of detrusor overactivity. Enuresis was much more common (50%) than expected in this series of WBS, which included children with a mean age of 9.7 years. Other abnormalities also appear to be more common in WBS (Table) including hernias (female), undescended testes (male), and bladder diverticulum. Hypercalcemia may only occur in about 15% of patients and hypercalciuria may occur in a third of patients. Nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis do occur (2.5% in the study cited in the Table and about 2% of 176 patients in other studies). This is far less common than other genitourinary abnormalities. Hypertension in WBS can be caused by renal artery or aortic stenosis but there is also evidence for increased arterial stiffness. Hypertension may begin in infancy and reach a prevalence of 50% in adulthood. The vascular pathology of WBS includes narrowing of the elastic arteries (localized or diffuse) and potentially also arterial thickening of nonstenotic regions. In many series, the prevalence of detectable arterial stenosis exceeds the prevalence of hypertension. For the child in the vignette, nephrourologic anomalies or symptoms are more prevalent at her age than hypertension. Precocious puberty is common in girls with Williams syndrome, approaching 20% in some series. Williams-Beuren syndrome is caused by recurrent deletions of 7q11.23 of usually 1.55 to 1.84 megabases. The region for WBS encompasses the critical elastin gene (ELM. Flanking this region is the neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (WCF7) gene which, if preserved in a hemizygous manner, shows a reduced incidence of hypertension. Larger deletions (2-4 megabases) result in a more severe phenotype with more cognitive delays.

      "start oral rehydration therapy with a fruit juice",
      "start oral rehydration therapy with 300 mL of a carbohydrate electrolyte solution The child in the vignette displays signs of dehydration secondary to viral gastroenteritis. Based on the symptoms and signs, she likely has moderate dehydration representing up to 10% reduction in body weight. Of note, her heart rate is elevated and her blood pressure is below the 50th percentile. As such, she requires acute resuscitation to restore tissue perfusion. Of the choices presented, providing a bolus of intravenous isotonic fluid is the most appropriate initial step in hydration for this child. Viral gastroenteritis is a common cause of acute dehydration in pediatric patients. Dehydration can be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe based on changes in history and physical examination (Table). In addition, dehydration can be characterized as isonatremic, hyponatremic, or hypernatremic based on initial laboratory studies. In studies of pediatric gastroenteritis, most patients have isonatremic dehydration in which the serum sodium level is between 135 and 145 mmol/L. Fluid resuscitation of a dehydrated patient can be broken down into several different phases: acute resuscitation, titration, maintenance, and convalescent phase. The goal of acute resuscitation is to rapidly restore tissue perfusion to prevent the development of end-organ damage/injury. During the titration phase, fluids are transitioned from bolus to continuous (“maintenance”) infusion rates. The goal of the maintenance phase is to maintain normal fluid balance while accounting for any ongoing losses. Finally, during the convalescent phase, supplemental fluids are discontinued and patients are allowed to use their own internal homeostatic drives to maintain fluid balance. A carbohydrate electrolyte solution is an appropriate choice for oral rehydration but should not be the initial choice in the vignette because of this child's need for acute resuscitation. It is also unlikely that she would tolerate such a large volume orally, given her vomiting. Starting maintenance fluids is also inappropriate as an initial therapy until her vital signs have been stabilized after the administration of bolus fluids. Fruit juice is not an appropriate rehydration fluid.

      "oral cyclophosphamide will be less toxic than intravenous pulse therapy Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that has both cytotoxic and immunosuppressive properties. Cyclophosphamide is used to treat certain malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug that is metabolized in the liver to both active and inactive metabolites by the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 system. The metabolites and a fraction of unchanged drug (~30%) are ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Therefore, patients with reduced renal function have decreased renal excretion of cyclophosphamide and its metabolites, resulting in increased plasma levels and increased toxicity; the lower the renal function, the higher is the systemic exposure. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that the area under the curve of cyclophosphamide increases by approximately 35% when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 25% to 50%, approximately 65% when GFR is 10% to 24%, and approximately 25% in patients receiving hemodialysis. Dialysis removes cyclophosphamide and its metabolites, though the degree of removal is likely to vary, depending on the type of dialysis. Hemodialysis is reported to remove about 35% of the cyclophosphamide dose administered, with elimination half-life reducing to approximately 3.5 hours, as opposed to approximately 6.5 hours in uremic patients. Dose reduction is thereby warranted in patients with renal insufficiency to limit toxicity without reducing treatment efficacy. There are, however, no clear guidelines for appropriate dose reduction in renal impairment. Much lower doses of cyclophosphamide are required to treat autoimmune diseases, compared with doses used for malignancies, which are usually much higher. Hence, results of outcome studies in oncology patients cannot be applied interchangeably while treating patients with autoimmune diseases. For optimal dosing, the degree of renal insufficiency and whether the patient is receiving hemodialysis needs to be assessed first. Some advocate a 25% dose reduction in patients with GFR less than 50%, and the use of extreme caution or drug discontinuation for GFR less than 10%. For patients receiving dialysis, some suggest a 25% dose reduction, with the dose administered after hemodialysis using a consistent interval between dosing and dialysis. However, recommendations vary and are usually based on clinical circumstances and underlying disease, weighing the risk versus benefit before every dose administered. The patient in the vignette has a hemorrhagic cystitis. It is the most common urologic toxicity of cyclophosphamide, occurring in patients receiving high- dose/prolonged course, but it can develop even with lower doses. Acrolein is an inactive metabolite of cyclophosphamide that has a direct toxic effect on bladder mucosa leading to hemorrhagic cystitis. Cystitis usually occurs within 1 to 2 days of drug exposure, but can also occur late, several weeks after stopping the drug. Hemorrhagic cystitis from cyclophosphamide treatment predisposes patients to an increased risk of bladder cancer many years after treatment is completed. To prevent the complication of hemorrhagic cystitis, aggressive hydration is important (oral or intravenous [IV]); in addition, bladder irrigation and frequent bladder emptying should be done so the contact time of acrolein with bladder mucosa is minimized. Prophylaxis with mesna (2 mercaptoethane sulphone sodium) is recommended, especially in patients receiving high doses. Mesna binds with acrolein and reduces its toxic effects on the bladder mucosa. The drug should be given to any patient making urine (as in this patient) in whom cyclophosphamide or its metabolites can potentially enter the urinary tract, to prevent toxicity. In anuric patients, cyclophosphamide and its metabolites do not appear in the urinary tract; hence, the use of mesna is not required. Symptoms of hemorrhagic cystitis usually resolve within a week without any active treatment if cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped. If symptoms are more severe and persistent, patients may require blood transfusion, and at times, more aggressive interventions, including electrocautery, cryosurgery, or formaldehyde irrigation to help stop the bleeding. Cystoscopy reveals diffuse hyperemia, petechiae, and ecchymoses, which may be actively bleeding. Oral bioavailability of cyclophosphamide is 75% to 100%, and oral and IV doses produce similar peak levels. Daily oral dosing is associated with increased length of treatment and higher total cumulative exposure as opposed to intermittent IV dosing. In addition, with oral administration, adequate hydration and bladder emptying is often inconsistent. Therefore, daily oral treatment with cyclophosphamide is associated with an increased risk of complications, including hemorrhagic cystitis and bladder cancer when compared with intermittent IV treatment. PREP Pearls * Cyclophosphamide dose should be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency to reduce toxicity. Hydration, frequent voiding, bladder irrigation, and mesna help prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. * Daily oral dosing of cyclophosphamide is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic cystitis and bladder cancer.

      "continuous renal replacement therapy",
      "fluid restriction only c. intermittent hemodialysis Dz intravenous furosemide only The child in the vignette has sepsis based on his elevated temperature, elevated heart rate, and increased white blood cell count. Because of his decreased blood pressure and need for a vasoactive infusion, he meets the criteria for severe sepsis. He has developed oliguria with an average urine output of less than 0.3 mL/kg per hour, and he has an elevated serum creatinine indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). Using the Kidney Diseases Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for AKI, he has stage 3 disease based on urine output criteria. Sepsis is now the most common underlying factor that promotes the development of AKI in hospitalized patients. The AKI that develops often occurs early and can be quite severe, with prolonged oliguria leading to progressive fluid overload. The AKI is associated with prolonged length of stay in the intensive care unit and increased risk of death. The etiology of sepsis-associated AKI remains complex. Initial hypotheses suggested that renal hypoperfusion caused by systemic hypotension was the key factor underlying AKI. However, recent studies point to endothelial cell dysfunction and injury to the renal microvasculature as key factors contributing to proximal tubular cell damage. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is often used to provide supportive care in the setting of sepsis-associated AKI. Numerous studies have pointed to the importance of the degree of fluid overload at the time of initiation of RRT for predicting outcome, with outcomes worsening as fluid overload increases above 10%. The child in the vignette developed 20% fluid overload within the first 24 hours and is profoundly oliguric. As such, fluid restriction is unlikely to be effective. In addition, fluid restriction would interfere with nutritional and other supportive care. Furosemide is a potential option; however, given the profound oliguria, it carries a high risk that he will not respond to it. This points to the need for RRT. Randomized trials in adults have failed to show a difference in outcome between intermittent hemodialysis and continuous RRT, but no similar studies have been performed in pediatrics. Given his need for a vasoactive infusion, the preferred choice is to start continuous RRT. PREP Pearls + Acute kidney injury in sepsis is severe with a rapid onset and carries with it a high risk of morbidity and mortality. + Alterations to renal microvasculature (endothelial dysfunction) in sepsis play a central role in renal proximal tubular cell injury and the development of acute kidney injury. + Fluid overload is an important risk factor for mortality in patients with acute kidney injury.

      "perform a renal biopsy The history and examination findings in this patient—acute kidney injury (AKI), eosinophilia, microscopic hematuria, and pyuria with a pruritic rash—is suspicious for acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (AIN). Proton pump inhibitors, like omeprazole, are known to lead to AIN, along with a multitude of other medications (Table). In children, the most frequent cause of AIN is medication exposure, particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, diuretics, and antiepileptics. Interestingly, drug-induced AIN is not dose dependent and onset can range from 1 day after medication initiation (ie, with rifampin) to 18 months after initiation (ie, with NSAIDs). Despite this potential wide range of presentation, patients most commonly present with AIN 2 to 3 weeks after medication initiation. Most patients with AIN are asymptomatic, though some will present with the classic triad of fever, rash, and eosinophilia. The rash can take several forms (maculopapular, morbilliform, or urticarial), typically occurs on the trunk and proximal extremities, and may be transient and/or pruritic. Other symptoms of AIN, such as nausea, vomiting, and malaise, are nonspecific. Almost all patients have an elevated creatinine concentration and many will have peripheral eosinophilia, but this is not required for diagnosis. Urinary findings are often minimal to none, though hematuria (gross and microscopic), isosthenuria, pyuria (and specifically eosinophiluria), and proteinuria can be present. When proteinuria is present, it is usually non-nephrotic; however, NSAIDs can be associated with nephrotic range proteinuria, specifically NSAID- induced membranous nephropathy or minimal change disease. Although eosinophiluria can be present, it does not distinguish AIN from other causes of AKI. When AIN is suspected as the cause of AKI, the initial first steps in management include discontinuation of the potential offending agent while offering supportive therapy. Occasionally, in extreme circumstances, dialysis may be indicated while awaiting renal recovery. If there is no improvement in renal function after 3 to 7 days, steroids can be offered either as an intravenous pulse followed by oral therapy for several weeks, or by an oral pulse (1-2 mg/kg per day) followed by a taper over several weeks. The use of steroids is controversial, and when steroid administration is considered, it is most appropriate to perform a renal biopsy earlier, to confirm the diagnosis of AIN. Further, steroid treatment is more likely to be effective if it is initiated earlier in the clinical course. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced AIN may be less responsive to steroids, and some individuals will declare themselves as steroid dependent or steroid resistant. In those instances, there is some (limited) evidence to suggest that mycophenolate may be effective. Although more commonly caused by obstructive uropathy, vesicoureteral reflux, and genetic diseases, drugs and toxins can also cause chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis in children (Table). In addition, AIN can lead to chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis if unchecked and progressive. Individuals with chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis often have a slow and insidious course of progressive renal failure with symptoms mainly nonspecific and related to their renal failure. Common symptoms include weight loss, growth failure, fatigue, poor appetite, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia. As with AIN, when chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis is caused by a drug or toxin, the treatment is focused on supportive treatment and removal of the offending agent. However, in contrast to AIN, there are no known effective treatments, and in severe cases, the damage may be irreversible when detected, with progressive chronic kidney disease. For the child in the vignette who had rash, eosinophilia, hematuria, and AKI that developed soon after initiating a new medication known to be associated with AIN, discontinuing omeprazole should be the first step in management. If this child's creatinine does not improve after medication cessation, then a kidney biopsy with steroid treatment should be considered at that time. A normal saline bolus in a well-hydrated individual is unlikely to effectively treat AKI, making that option not the best choice for this scenario. PREP Pearls + Most patients with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis are asymptomatic, though some will present with the classic triad of fever, rash, and eosinophilia. + When acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is suspected, the initial first steps in management include discontinuation of the potential offending agent while offering supportive therapy. + Although more commonly caused by urologic diseases, drugs and toxins can also cause chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis in children; withdrawal of the offending agent and supportive therapy are also the focus of initial management in these cases.

The 2 terms have different meanings, though there is considerable overlap between them. + Asystematic review is a formal, systematic, transparent, and structured approach to review all published literature on a s/ng/e topic to answer a well- defined question. + Ameta-analysis is a statistical method that combines quantitative results of reviewed studies in a new statistical framework to test a hypothesis. Both methods can be used together. A systematic review can be performed alone, but a meta-analysis is only ever conducted after a systematic review. The most important limitation of a meta-analysis is the possibility of misleading results, which can be caused by multiple factors such as the inclusion of poor-quality studies, significant heterogeneity between the studies, methodology errors, and author bias. A meta-analysis gives weighted values for each study's effect sizes. It also provides information on whether a publication bias is present or not when assessing positive and negative studies. A meta-analysis is not a good choice if the review question is better answered with qualitative data, such as “What is the patient's acceptability of psychosocial interventions for improving medication adherence?” or if the studies are too heterogeneous and different to combine. Generally such studies are performed to assess efficacy between interventions, but they can be used for other areas, such as comparing laboratory test accuracy. Neither type of study is ideal if the studies are too few or the cumulative sample size is small. Systematic reviews are time consuming and need to follow a meticulous format, as suggested by the Cochrane review group (http://www.cochrane.org/handbook): 1. Formulate and define a clear study question; ideally register your proposed review title with an organization such as Cochrane. Train on literature search methods. Publish your proposed methodology in advance as a protocol. Prepare a robust and large electronic bibliographic database for search strategies such as MEDLINE. 5. Systematically identify which studies will be reviewed. . 6. Screen the search results against the prespecified selection criteria to identify included studies. 7. Define the procedure used to review the target papers (eg, 2 authors reviewed each article; if they disagreed, a 3rd author gave input, then it was discussed, and a consensus was reached). 8. Appraise the quality of studies found. 9. Tabulate the data collected. 10. Synthesize the evidence. 11. Publish your review. There are specific software programs that can help with meta-analyses. For the specific question in the vignette of whether other serum biomarkers are superior to serum creatinine, these are numerical markers with multiple studies available and on a single topic of renal function, so they are amenable to both systematic review and meta-analysis. Meta-analyses comparing serum cystatin C and serum creatinine to a gold standard glomerular filtration rate (GFR) test have been performed. In such meta-analyses, the numerical area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for cystatin C to a gold standard clearance method for GFR measurement was significantly higher than for serum creatinine. Such systematic reviews and meta-analyses can include both full-text articles and conference abstracts, provided the latter have sufficient information for comparison purposes.

      "she will likely have a significant decline in renal function in the next 2 decades of life The patient in the vignette has medullary sponge kidney (MSK). The condition is largely thought to be a developmental disorder and generally benign in nature. In some families, the condition follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Like many developmental disorders, the spectrum of disease is variable. The abnormal developmental processes occur at the interface of the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme, which leads to papillary collecting duct abnormalities. Patients can have subtle tubular defects such as distal acidification and concentration abnormalities from ectatic changes in the collecting ducts. They can also have macrocysts in the medulla. Because of the distal acidification defect and hypocitraturia, these patients are at risk for nephrocalcinosis and calcium stones. In addition, the incidence of urinary tract infections is higher in patients with MSK. Although patients often have the complications listed earlier, MSK is not associated with declining renal function in the absence of recurrent pyelonephritis or obstructing stones. Thus, treatment of the disorder is generally focused on management of acidosis and prevention of nephrolithiasis and urinary tract infections. Acidosis is treated with alkali. Treatment of stones is consistent with the treatment plan for all stone formers. If hypocitraturia is present, citrate therapy should be instituted. In patients with urinary tract infections, these episodes should be treated accordingly. Because of the risk of recurrent infections and potentially struvite stone development, patients should be evaluated for struvite stones and treated appropriately with urologic consultation when indicated. Complications have been associated with each of these treatment plans. Patients receiving potassium citrate may develop gastrointestinal symptoms or electrolyte abnormalities. Patients with repeated antibiotic use for recurrent urinary tract infections are at risk for the development of drug resistance. The patient in the vignette has hypocitraturia and nephrocalcinosis. The workup for this patient and treatment with a citrate salt is consistent with the treatment plan indicated in other patients with kidney stones and hypocitraturia. Given her family history, the stone is unlikely to be caused by uric acid, which is often seen in patients with medullary cystic kidney disease (autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial disease) caused by Uromodulin mutations. Patients with MSK are not resistant to citrate therapy. Finally, most patients with MSK do not experience a decline in renal function unless they have repeated pyelonephritis or obstructive stone episodes. PREP Pearls + Patients with medullary sponge kidney disease do not generally experience renal function decline from their intrinsic disease. Medullary sponge kidney is thought to be a developmental abnormality that results in medullary collecting duct functional abnormalities. + Patients with medullary sponge kidney are at higher risk for distal renal tubular acidosis, hypocitraturia, recurrent kidney stones, and recurrent urinary tract infections.

    "options": [
      "about 20% of children with her background and sickle cell disease have microalbuminuria",
      "about 10% of patients with sickle cell disease are receiving dialysis by age 20 years",
      "her enuresis is likely related to a concentration defect arising from her sickle cell disease",
      "her pain crises do not put her at higher risk for kidney disease An increasing number of studies from sub-Saharan Africa have better defined the early natural history of renal involvement in sickle cell disease. In 7 series comprising over 2,000 children and young adults (median age ranges 8-17 years) from sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of microalbuminuria ranged between 16% and 38%. In general, older ages were associated with a higher rate of microalbuminuria. Similarly, a cohort from Michigan has been reported with a median age of approximately 9 years and a microalbuminuria prevalence of 26%. Renal concentration defects (hyposthenuria) are common in sickle cell disease. The medulla of the kidney, where renal concentration takes place, provides an environment with hypoxia, low pH, and high osmolality that predisposes red blood cells in patients with sickle cell disease to sickle. When this occurs in the vasa recta, capillaries can become occluded, leading to ischemia, sometimes even necrosis, and progressive fibrosis. In adults with sickle cell disease, 30% to 40% may be found to have renal infarcts or papillary necrosis. The resulting renal concentration defect occurs over time and adults with sickle cell disease often can only achieve urinary concentrations of 400 or 450 mOsm/kg. This is a half to a third of the urine concentration ability of normal adults. However, in children with sickle cell disease and enuresis, the major risk factors are a family history of enuresis and male sex. In one study, patients with enuresis actually had a higher concentration ability than those without. Pain crises in patients with sickle cell disease are related to vaso-occlusive events and may have a number of triggers, including dehydration, stress, and exposure to cold. They are treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, and hydration. In patients requiring admission, a recent series of nearly 200 patients reported a 17% incidence of acute kidney injury. Risk factors for acute kidney injury include reduced hemoglobin values on admission compared with baseline and receiving ketorolac for multiple days. Acute kidney injury was also associated with longer hospitalization. The progression to end-stage kidney disease in sickle cell has been described in a 40-year study of more than 1,000 patients. In this study, approximately 11.5% of patients had end-stage kidney disease at a median age of 37 years. Nearly 30% of the patients who died during this observational study had renal failure before death. Other renal manifestations include renal tubular acidosis, which is usually mild. It is often apparent only during other events such as dehydration or illness. Oddly, the proximal tubule may actually function better in sickle cell disease, resulting in an increase in tubular secretion of creatinine. This tubular secretion of creatinine, in addition to hyperfiltration, results in a high estimated glomerular filtration rate. This may lead to inappropriate drug dosing and underappreciation of acute kidney injury in patients with sickle cell disease. Glomerular disease may also be present in patients with sickle cell disease. This may be manifest by membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with or without hepatitis C infection. In addition, some patients develop nephrotic syndrome with or without focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Despite the renal blood flow abnormalities, patients with sickle cell disease on average have lower blood pressures than the overall black population. This is thought to be in part because of sodium wasting due to tubular defects. Those with only sickle cell trait also have higher risk of kidney disease. Hematuria is common and thought to occur because of similar mechanisms present in sickle cell disease. Sickle cell trait is present in 15% of black patients with end-stage disease versus only 7% of the general black population. PREP Pearls + Microalbuminuria is common in sickle cell disease. + Renal concentration defects develop in sickle cell disease. * Glomerular disease also occurs in sickle cell disease. + Tubular secretion of creatinine may be increased in sickle cell disease, leading to falsely elevated estimate of glomerular filtration.

      "the lack of hematuria makes ureteral rupture unlikely The patient in the vignette has signs and symptoms consistent with ureteral rupture. Ureteral rupture is a rare occurrence, and usually is associated with trauma or iatrogenic in nature. A detailed history consistent with mechanism of injury is important. Penetrating injuries (such as gunshot wounds) or blunt force trauma can result in unilateral or bilateral injury to the ureter. Abdominal, retroperitoneal, and gynecologic surgery can result in accidental injury to the ureter. The physical findings associated with ruptured ureter are nonspecific and often lead to difficulty in diagnosis. Patients can complain of abdominal or flank pain and fever. Often in the context of trauma or after surgery, the nonspecific symptoms can be attributed to musculoskeletal or postoperative symptoms, thus making the diagnosis of ureteral rupture challenging. The laboratory diagnostic approach is difficult and nonspecific as well. Less than half the patients with ureteral rupture have hematuria. If significant hemorrhage is seen from the ruptured ureter, patients may experience a significant drop in hemoglobin as well as hemodynamic instability. Patients who depend significantly on the affected urinary drainage system (ie, solitary kidneys) may have a significant elevation in serum creatinine as leaking urine is reabsorbed. When patients have a fluid collection that is concerning for urine leak/urinoma, fluid sampling may be possible percutaneously. A fluid creatinine concentration greater than serum creatinine concentration is diagnostic for urine because no other fluid physiologically can have a creatinine level more concentrated than serum. Fluid creatinine levels equal to or less than serum creatinine indicate a nonurine source of the fluid collection. Diagnosis of urine leak can be made radiographically or invasively. Computed tomography urography with delayed images after the parenchymal phase (5-10 minutes after contrast administration) with extravasation of contrast from the ureters is diagnostic. Direct laparotomy inspection can be performed in patients who need additional abdominal exploration/surgery. Finally, cystoscopy with retrograde pyelography performed by urology is a sensitive method for detecting defects in ureteral integrity. For the girl in the vignette, the most accurate statement is that a fluid collection creatinine concentration is greater than serum creatinine. Many organs can produce fluid with a sodium concentration less than that seen in serum, thus, any sodium concentration is not definitive for urine leak. Computed tomography findings do not suggest lack of ureteral rupture because only the parenchymal phase is noted and not the excretory phase. Computed tomography is also not 100% sensitive, therefore, a negative scan with high clinical suspicion should warrant further evaluation. Finally, ureteral rupture does not need to be accompanied by hematuria as seen in more than half of the cases of ureteral rupture. PREP Pearls * Patients with ureter rupture often have nonspecific symptoms, thereby making diagnosis difficult. * Diagnostic fluid collection (urinoma) sampling should reveal a creatinine concentration greater than serum in urine leaks. * Computed tomography urography (including excretory phase) and/or cystoscopy with retrograde pyelography should be used to diagnose ureteral rupture.

      "order magnetic resonance imaging to rule out an intracranial process",
      "perform head computed tomography to rule out an occult hemorrhage Hospitalized children, particularly those treated with nephrotoxic agents, are at increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ketorolac are commonly used for pain control, but they are among the most common causes of AKI. When NSAID- or other toxin-associated AKI is identified, prompt medication discontinuation is warranted. Initial management of AKI is supportive, with close laboratory monitoring for serum creatinine trends and associated electrolyte derangements, and with judicious fluid administration to allow for adequate perfusion and avoidance of volume overload. Electrolyte derangements of particular concern in acute renal dysfunction include hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and metabolic acidosis. These laboratory findings are often asymptomatic, and when severe, can be life- threatening. Hyperkalemia in particular is of concern, because it can lead to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Patients with hyperkalemia may experience muscle weakness, paralysis, palpitations, syncope, and even asystole. Prompt identification and emergent treatment of hyperkalemia can therefore be life-saving. Hypocalcemia can also lead to electrocardiographic changes such as QTc prolongation, and can present with life-threatening seizures, refractory heart failure, or laryngospasm if severe. Other symptoms may include muscle cramps, weakness, or spasms; fatigue; irritability; and paresthesias. Treatment is often complicated by concomitant hyperphosphatemia. When the calcium phosphate product (calcium concentration * phosphate concentration) is greater than 60 mg2/dL2, calcium phosphate can precipitate in the renal tubules, causing or exacerbating AKI, and can also precipitate in other organs like the heart, where it can cause cardiac arrhythmias. When the calcium phosphate product exceeds 70 mg2/dL2, renal replacement therapy should be considered. Metabolic acidosis is largely asymptomatic, with the only potential findings being an increased respiratory rate and Kussmaul-type respirations. Metabolic acidosis needs to be corrected, with careful attention paid to calcium and phosphorus levels; as the pH increases, hypocalcemia may worsen because more free calcium is able to bind to albumin. In the setting of recovering AKI, electrolyte derangements can be prevented with careful attention to electrolyte delivery and losses. In oligoanuric patients, potassium and phosphorus delivery should be avoided or restricted in both intravenous fluids as well as oral diets. However, in children with polyuric AKI, supplementation of these electrolytes may be required because of wasting in the urine. Treatment should therefore be individualized and adapted to the clinical scenario. For the boy in the vignette, muscle weakness and hyporeflexia in the setting of AKI and initiation of an oral diet raise concerns for electrolyte abnormalities. Of greatest concern is hyperkalemia for the reasons stated before; thus, immediate measurement of electrolytes is warranted to allow for emergent treatment if needed. Although a neurologic cause such as an intracranial hemorrhage and mass or nerve conduction abnormality could also explain his findings, electrolyte derangements should be ruled out first in someone with AKI. PREP Pearls + Life-threatening electrolyte derangements, including hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and metabolic acidosis, can occur with acute kidney injury. Patients with acute kidney injury should have close monitoring of electrolytes. Patients with oligoanuria should have potassium- and phosphorus-restricted diets, whereas those with polyuric renal failure may require electrolyte supplementation.

      "recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have long been known to suffer from short stature and growth failure. The causes of this growth failure are multifactorial, including poor appetite, impaired nutrient absorption, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, hormonal derangements, and inadequate nutrition relative to needs. The critical role of growth hormone in these derangements first became known in the 1950s. The development and use of growth hormone has been one of the seminal advances in pediatric nephrology, allowing for the treatment of short stature and growth failure that is very common in advanced CKD. From 1963 to 1985, human growth hormone (pituitary hGH) was made from human pituitary glands by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP), funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In 1985, 3 young men treated with pituitary hGH died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare and incurable brain disease of unclear etiology, now thought to be related to prions (infectious proteins). The HHS then identified 33 cases of CID among the nearly 7,700 people in the United States who received NHPP pituitary hGH, as well as 6 people in New Zealand and 2 in Brazil, all of whom received US- made pituitary hGH. The NIDDK website https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health- information/endocrine-diseases/national-hormone-pituitary- program/comprehensive-report lists another 215 victims in other countries, mostly in France and the United Kingdom. However, there is no risk of transmission of CJD from the currently used recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). Landmark randomized placebo-controlled studies by Fine and colleagues established the improvements in somatic height in children with CKD from the use of daily injections of rhGH. Standardized height Z-score increased from -2.94 to -1.55 in the rhGH group after 24 months of treatment, and decreased from -2.82 to -2.91 in the placebo group (P<.00005). The drug is not without side effects. Among the most common reported side effects are pseudotumor cerebri (intracranial hypertension/papilledema), worsening of prior scoliosis, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and slipped capital femoral epiphyses. Because growth hormone also has immunostimulatory effects in vitro, another potential risk was inciting an acute rejection event; however, the formal randomized studies through the North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study (NAPRTCS) showed no increase in 1-year acute rejection rates compared with the control group. After 1 year, the 6 standardized height deviation score was +0.49+0.10 in the treatment group (N=30) compared with -0.10+0.08 in the control group (N=22; P<.001). During the first year, there were no rejection episodes in the treatment group and 3 in the control group. In addition to the side effects listed before, secondary malignancy has been reported, including colorectal cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma in the UK cohorts treated with pituitary-derived growth hormone. With the newer rhGH, increased death rates after bone tumors or cerebral hemorrhage have been reported from France in patients treated for nonrenal indications, but the data on increased risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease remain conflicting. Diabetes mellitus has been reported after growth hormone replacement in treated acromegaly. In children with end-stage renal disease, both the NAPRTCS study and a German study reported that long-term rhGH treatment does not affect glucose tolerance or cause diabetes mellitus, but aggravates the preexisting fasting hyperinsulinemia. Insulin secretion increases persistently during rhGH treatment because of a direct insulinagogic effect of growth hormone. This increase is most pronounced in patients with transplants who are receiving concomitant glucocorticoid therapy. The NAPRTCS registry and a Cochrane meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials evaluated adverse event rates of rhGH use in children with CKD who are receiving dialysis, and after renal transplantation. Notably, the use of rhGH in these populations was not associated with increased incidences of malignancy, intracranial hypertension, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, avascular necrosis, glucose intolerance, pancreatitis, progressive deterioration of renal function, acute allograft rejection, or fluid retention. Growth hormone does not have any impact on recurrence of primary renal disease. In growth hormone use for non-CKD conditions, respiratory problems and sudden death have been reported in Prader-Willi syndrome. Osteoporosis, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and hyperlipidemia are relatively frequent complications of growth hormone use in Turner syndrome. Compared with incremental height gain, data on patterns of sexual development after renal transplantation are more scant. In the Cooperative Study for Pubertal Development in CKD, the onset of puberty was delayed by 2 to 2.5 years on average. Other studies found that delayed puberty may be more common in boys and more in accordance with bone age rather than chronological age. However, once started, puberty appears to proceed at a normal rate. Menarche is also achieved late. Final height is therefore achieved late in many children with CKD if bone age is delayed. In contrast, reproductive potential may be permanently affected, especially in boys with CKD, in whom germ cell depletion and low sperm counts are reported. Sirolimus use is associated with lower sperm counts and reduced male fertility. The boy in the vignette has flattening of catch-up growth after renal transplantation. Of the answer choices listed, hyperinsulinemia is the adverse effect that one should most likely expect with rhGH use after renal transplantation. PREP Pearls + Height scores tend to be low in children with chronic kidney disease and chronic kidney failure. * Growth hormone is successful at increasing growth velocity both before and after renal transplantation. + Side effects of growth hormone that are reported in some studies do not appear to be more frequent in chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation in children.

      "she will require dialysis",

      "there will be no change in renal function",
      "her renal function will improve with appropriate therapy As defined by the 2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference Nomenclature of Vasculitides (CHCC2012), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)- associated vasculitis (AAV) is a necrotizing vasculitis, with few or no immune deposits, predominantly affecting small vessels (capillaries, venules, arterioles, small arteries). Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are IgG autoantibodies directed against constituents of primary neutrophil granules. There are 2 major immunostaining patterns: (1) cytoplasmic-ANCA (c-ANCA), which has a diffuse granular pattern with central accentuation, suggesting the presence of serum proteinase 3 (PR3- ANCA); and (2) perinuclear-ANCA (p-ANCA), which has a perinuclear pattern with perinuclear extension associated with myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA). Atypical ANCA which is non-MPO or non-PR3 is usually associated with inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune disorders; infections including Bartonella, tuberculosis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, and medications including propylthiouracil, hydralazine, penicillin, sulfonamide, quinolones, thiazides, allopurinol. Levels of ANCA should be measured using high-quality immunoassays. Classification of AAV is as follows: 1. Granulomatosis with angiitis (GPA) presents with granulomatous inflammation in the upper (nasal passages) and lower respiratory tract, kidneys, pulmonary capillaries, and skin. Renal involvement is seen in 50% to 100% of children. This type of AAV is associated with PR3-ANCA. 2. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is characterized by the absence of granuloma, commonly seen with renal disease, pulmonary involvement, and skin lesions. It is associated with MPO-ANCA. 3. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA or Churg-Strauss) presents with extravascular granulomatous inflammation with eosinophilia and asthma. Cardiomyopathy is frequently reported in children. Thirty five percent to 40% of cases are associated with MPO-ANCA. 4. Renal limited vasculitis (RLV) is seen with no evidence of systemic involvement. Although AAV can occur at any age, its peak incidence in adults is between 65 and 75 years of age, with a slight predominance in men and among white patients. In children, the peak incidence is between 11 and 14 years of age, more common in girls, with a predominance of GPA. Response to therapy is similar in all races. Previous studies have shown that renal disease is found in 99% of patients with MPA and 94% of those with GPA. Pulmonary involvement occurs in 61% of patients with GPA and 41% in MPA. Less than 10% of patients with GPA, MPA, EGPA, or RLV are ANCA negative. In the vignette, the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory and histologic findings are most compatible with MPA. Her p-ANCA and MPO-ANCA are both positive, with crescentic glomerulonephritis and absence of granuloma in her kidney biopsy. Renal biopsy should be performed for diagnosis and prognostication of renal outcome. The significant pathologic finding is pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. In 2010, Berden and colleagues proposed a histologic classification of AAV based on renal biopsy findings in adult patients to better predict renal outcome: (1) focal: 50% or more normal glomeruli; (2) crescentic: 50% or more glomeruli with crescents; (3) mixed: 50% or less normal, 50% or less crescentic, 50% or less globally sclerotic glomeruli; (4) sclerotic: 50% or more globally sclerotic glomeruli. This study showed that baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and histologic findings are independent predictors of renal function in long-term follow-up. At the end of 1, 5, and 10 years of follow-up, renal survival was 93%, 93%, and 93%, respectively, with focal involvement; 84%, 76%, and 70%, respectively, in the crescentic group; 69%, 61%, and 50%, respectively, in the mixed category; and 50%, 50%, and 25%, respectively, in the sclerotic group. This validation study showed that focal involvement had a favorable outcome; crescentic findings showed active disease with renal impairment on presentation, but with aggressive treatment may have a chance of some renal recovery; mixed histology had intermediate outcome; and the sclerotic group had the highest risk for ESRD within the first year of presentation. Similar results have been reported in children with AAV and renal involvement. The patient in the vignette has crescentic disease and small amount of glomerulosclerosis. According to Berden and coworkers, appropriate treatment of such patients can lead to some renal recovery and improvement in renal function. A retrospective study in children showed that 2 years after AAV diagnosis, eGFR above 60 mL/min was 100% for focal lesions, 56.5% for the crescentic or mixed group, and 0% with sclerosis. The pathogenesis of AAV is complex and includes the interplay of genetic risks, environmental or infectious triggers, and defects in B-cell (autoreactive memory B cells produce autoantibodies) and T-cell regulation (Tregs dysfunction), leading to neutrophil degranulation, endothelial cell damage, and granuloma formation. The initial inciting factor is still unknown. Environmental factors that can trigger AAV include air pollutants (silica), infections (Staphylococcus aureus, viral infections), and medications (penicillamine, propylthiouracil, dapsone, cocaine). Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies bind to antigen, leading to neutrophil activation induced by Fc receptor engagement and cross-linking of Fabs, activate primed neutrophils, and binds certain antigens on surface of neutrophils. Neutrophil activation results in “NETosis,” cell death leading to release of decomposed chromatin including PR3 and MPO. This cascade can also trigger the alternate complement pathway. Histologic evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy and elevations of serum C3a, C5a, and C5b-9 have been described in patients with active disease. In vivo studies have shown that administration of anti-C5a blocks the development of nephritis in AAV. The intensity of the initial immune response may be dependent on the presence of certain HLA molecules. Genome-wide association studies have described genetic variants in GPA including HLA-DP SERPINA7 (encoding a4-antitrypsin), and PRTN3 (encoding PR3); MPA has been found to be associated with HLA-DQ. These associations are stronger with specificity for MPO-ANCA and PR3-ANCA than clinical diagnosis of GPA or MPA. Current therapy for AAV includes induction treatment for 3 to 6 months with cyclophosphamide or rituximab with glucocorticoids. The addition of plasmapheresis as part of induction therapy is currently being evaluated. Once remission is attained, maintenance therapy is provided with mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, or rituximab. Mycophenolate mofetil can lead to increased risk of relapse compared with azathioprine in some clinical studies. Intermittent doses of rituximab is superior to azathioprine in maintaining remission. Relapses are more frequent in GPA than MPA.

      "|Response Choice | Incidence] Prevalence D Stable Stable The incidence and prevalence of a disease offer insight into how frequently the disease occurs and how many individuals are living with the disease, respectively. Incidence refers to the number of new cases identified over the course of a study period. Prevalence refers to the total number of individuals in a population with the disease of interest. Prevalence can be categorized as point prevalence or period prevalence. Point prevalence refers to the number of individuals at a specific point in time. Period prevalence refers to the number of cases during a specified period. Depending on the disease being studied, the incidence may or may not influence prevalence. For a disease that has a short course and high resolution rate, such as postinfectious glomerulonephritis, the incidence may remain stable over time while the prevalence stays relatively low. This relationship also may be true for diseases with a very high mortality rate. Conversely, if a disease has a low mortality rate and low rate of resolution, a stable incidence of the disease will increase the prevalence. Prevalence of a disease is very important when assessing the usefulness of a diagnostic or screening test. For a given test, if the sensitivity and specificity are known, the positive and negative predictive values vary based on the prevalence of the disease in question. As prevalence increases, the positive predictive value increases and the negative predictive value decreases. Conversely, if the disease is very rare with a low prevalence, the positive predictive value decreases while the negative predictive value increases. This concept is important when applying screening tests and interpreting results based on certain populations or cohorts. By applying the same test to a “high-risk” population with a higher prevalence, the positive predictive value may appear higher than if the same test was applied to a general population with a lower prevalence of the disease in question.

      "elevated plasma oxalate level Calcium oxalate stones are among the most common kidney stones in pediatrics. The boy in the vignette is young and has bilateral stones, which suggests an underlying metabolic defect. This is confirmed on the 24-hour urine study showing calcium oxalate excretion that is more than twice the upper limit of normal of 45 mg/1.73 m2 per day or 0.5 mmol/1.73 m2 per day. This suggests that the child has primary hyperoxaluria. Currently, there are 3 recognized types of primary hyperoxalurias (PH) which are all caused by an inborn error of metabolism. Type 1 primary hyperoxaluria results from mutations in alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) which normally metabolizes glyoxylate into glycine. Type 2 results from mutations in glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), which normally metabolizes glyoxylate into glycolate. In both types 1 and 2, deficiency in AGT or GRHPR results in elevated levels of glyoxylate. Type 3 also leads to elevated levels of glyoxylate, however indirectly. In type 3, a deficiency in 4-hydroxy-2- oxoglutarate aldolase leads to elevated levels of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate, which then inhibits the enzyme mutated in PH type 2. In all 3 types, elevated levels of glyoxylate are metabolized to oxalate via the action of lactate dehydrogenase. All 3 types of PH are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and can be confirmed on genetic testing. Type 1 generally has the most severe phenotype and is mostly like to present at a young age. Diagnosis of PH is initially suspected clinically based on the development of nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis during childhood. Urinary testing will then identify elevated levels of oxalate. Initially, plasma oxalate levels are normal because the kidney is able to rapidly clear plasma oxalate. However, eventually kidney function declines with progressive nephrocalcinosis. Oxalosis occurs as systemic oxalate levels build once the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 30 to 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2. This leads to the formation of calcium oxalate deposits that can affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. This can result in end-stage kidney disease, along with damage to the heart, eyes, bone and bone marrow, skin, and brain/nervous system. To a certain degree, the treatment of oxalosis depends on the underlying mutation. Some patients with PH type’ can be treated with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) which is a cofactor for AGT. All patients should be treated with aggressive hydration and citrate supplementation similar to patients with nongenetic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. Once a patient develops increased systemic oxalate levels because of advanced chronic kidney disease/end-stage kidney disease, renal replacement therapy is required. Of note, the high rates of endogenous oxalate production makes it challenging to clear adequate oxalate with standard hemodialysis prescriptions; some patients can benefit from peritoneal dialysis in addition to hemodialysis. Orthotopic liver transplantation can be curative because it can replace the deficient enzyme in PH. Patients should be referred for combined liver-kidney transplantation when GFR declines to less than 30 to 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2. The child in the vignette has an estimated GFR of 79 mL/min per 1.73 m2 the modified Schwartz formula. He has chronic kidney disease consistent with nephrocalcinosis but his estimated GFR is high enough that he should have normal plasma oxalate levels (normal <1.7 umol/L) and should not have any of the secondary tissue involvement such as anemia or cardiac involvement at this using time.

She has proliferative lesions in over 50% of her glomeruli consistent with class IV lupus nephritis. However, electron microscopy also demonstrates subepithelial deposits consistent with membranous (class V) lupus nephritis. Thus, the preferred response is class IV plus V. Class III lupus nephritis involves focal (<50% of glomeruli) proliferative lesions. Renal involvement of juvenile-onset SLE is common: 50% to 60% of children with SLE will develop nephritis. Treatment of lupus nephritis is largely guided by biopsy classification. The first classification system was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), followed by the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS). The ISN/RPS SLE classification system is continually updated (Table). Systemic lupus erythematosus is caused by antigen-antibody complexes and immune deposits on electron microscopy are frequently identified in SLE. As seen in the patient in the vignette, subepithelial (subpodocyte) deposits indicate class V (membranous) lupus nephritis. Subepithelial deposits (Figure 2) can occur in isolation or together with proliferative lesions. Mesangial deposits (Figure 3) can occur in even in mild (eg, class | or II) lupus nephritis.

Understanding the risk factors for decline in graft function is important. Certain risk factors are inherent to the transplanted kidney such as the age of the kidney donor. One of the most important is whether it is a living donor versus deceased donor kidney. Outcomes with living donor kidneys are superior and even a 6-antigen mismatch kidney from a living donor can achieve comparable outcomes to a 0-mismatch deceased donor kidney. To account for deceased donor kidney quality, the deceased kidney donor profile index score uses 10 factors, including the age of the donor, donor size, history of diabetes and hypertension, cause of death, ethnicity, serum creatinine, hepatitis C status, and whether donation occurred after circulatory death to score the kidney. Donor size mismatch can be important because kidneys from a smaller donor to a larger recipient (either living or deceased donor) have inferior outcomes compared with size-matched kidneys (donor and recipient about the same size). Small donor to small recipient increases the risk for vascular thrombosis of the allograft. There have also been concerns about kidneys from large donors being transplanted to smaller recipients; however, the clinical experience with infants receiving kidneys from adult donors is superior to all other age groups. Diseases that cause end-stage kidney disease in pediatric recipients may recur after transplantation. Post-transplantation disease may recur in more than half of the patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, sickle cell disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or hyperoxaluria. Some of these diseases, such as IgA nephropathy, infrequently cause graft loss whereas others like hyperoxaluria may cause graft loss in most cases of recurrence. A second problem can be de novo disease occurring after transplantation. The best examples of this are seen in patients with Finnish type congenital nephrotic syndrome who may develop antinephrin antibodies, causing recurrent nephrosis, and in patients with Alport syndrome who may develop alloantibodies against the graft basement membrane followed by anti-basement membrane disease. In patients without transplants, Goodpasture autoantibodies are directed against epitopes in the noncollagenous region of type IV collagen which become cryptic when the collagen trimer is assembled. The alloautobodies that may develop ina patient with Alport syndrome who receives a transplant may be extremely difficult to treat because the antibodies form against epitopes in the graft basement membrane that are not cryptic and may be always exposed. Adolescence is a peak time of decreased graft function. Some of this is postulated to be related to biologic factors, though most of it is attributed to adherence. In many studies, the outcomes of the transition population 12 to 24 years of age is worse than any other. However, this patient is totally dependent on his caregivers and caregiver nonadherence rather than patient nonadherence could be a potential issue. In addition to declining graft function leading to progressive chronic kidney disease and eventual end-stage kidney disease, other morbidities are commonly seen after transplantation. These include infectious complications, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, new-onset diabetes after transplantation, and cardiovascular complications. Some infections, such as BK nephropathy, cytomegalovirus infection, and urinary tract infection in the first 6 months after transplantation, have a significant impact on early graft decline. These processes may also lead to death. For pediatric kidney transplant recipients, death with a functional graft constitutes less than 10% of failed grafts in contrast to the adult population where this rate is more than 20%. The causes of death in transplant recipients with functioning graft include infection, cardiovascular/pulmonary disease, and malignancy.

      "secretion of hydrogen ion by proximal tubular cells The patient in the vignette has a normal anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) should be considered in the etiology for the failure to thrive. The patient has acidosis with an inappropriately high urine pH greater than 5.5, and a positive urine AG, and thus most likely has a distal RTA. Distal RTA occurs because of a defect in hydrogen (H*) ion secretion in the distal nephron. Hydrogen ion secretion requires both apical hydrogen adenosine triphosphatase and hydrogen/potassium (H*/K*)exchange, cytosolic carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2), and basolateral HCO3° /Cl’ exchange (AE1). Mutations in the apical H* ATPase are associated with distal RTA with deafness, and therefore the patient in the vignette is most likely to have defective secretion of hydrogen ion by the alpha intercalated cells (Figure 1). There are several forms of RTA: proximal (type 2), distal (type 1), and hyperkalemic (type 4) RTA. In addition, there is a form of combined proximal and distal RTA (type 3). Distal RTA can occur secondary to genetic defects (Table) or systemic disease. Secondary causes are more common in adults, and are typically related to medications (eg, amphotericin, lithium, trimethoprim) and autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren syndrome). In children, distal RTA may also occur secondary to obstructive uropathy, chronic kidney disease, volume depletion, and in the setting of pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis. In children, genetic defects may be inherited or occur de novo and may be mild or severe. Typical presentation of severe distal RTA is in infancy with growth failure. In addition, some patients present with vomiting, dehydration, impaired mental status, and rickets. Mild disease may present in later childhood as weakness or polyuria or in adolescence with nephrolithiasis. Prognosis of distal RTA varies depending on the etiology. Mild cases have normal long-term renal function. The initial diagnosis of RTA relies on confirmation of 1) metabolic acidosis (often including determination of pH on a venous blood gas), and 2) a normal AG (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis in the absence of diarrhea. The serum AG is most often calculated as (serum Na* - (serum Cl’ + serum HCO3). A normal AG is typically reported as 7 to 13 mEq/L in adults, but may vary by the analyzer used. In addition, the normal AG varies with age and may be as high as 14 to 16 mEq/L in newborns and children. The normal AG increases by 4 mEq/L if potassium is included in the calculation (as advocated by some, especially with a high/high normal potassium): (serum Na* + serum K*) - (serum Cl + serum HCO3). Low or low-normal potassium is suggestive of proximal or distal RTA (rather than hyperkalemic RTA). In a patient with acidosis, a negative urine AG and urine pH less than 5.3 effectively excludes a diagnosis of distal RTA. The urine AG is calculated as urine (Na*+ K*) - (CI) and represents unmeasured ammonium (NH,’). In the presence of acidosis, a urine pH greater than 5.5 and positive urinary AG suggest impaired acidification. Of note, this test cannot be used when urine sodium is less than 20 mEq/L. Although not universally available, determination of the fractional excretion of HCO3 100 * [HCO3 urine * plasma creatinine / HCO3 plasma * urine creatinine] can be a helpful next step. Fractional excretion of HCO3° greater than 15% is diagnostic of proximal (not distal) RTA. In some cases, treatment with alkali will also reveal the increased fractional excretion of HCO3 greater than 15%. Treatment of proximal RTA requires higher required doses of alkali (10-20 mEq/kg per day vs 1-2 mEq/kg per day in distal RTA) due to wasting from impaired bicarbonate reabsorption. Thus, alkali dose required to correct acidosis may also be suggestive of the underlying diagnosis. In a patient with normal AG acidosis, a fractional excretion of HCO3 less than 5%, urine pH greater than 5.5, and positive urinary AG are sufficient for diagnosis of a distal RTA. Treatment with ammonium chloride was sometimes given to patients to induce acidosis and to reveal urinary acidification defects in the past, but this is uncommonly used currently. Walsh et al reported use of oral furosemide/fludrocortisone challenge as an alternative means of assessing urinary acidification. By both increasing distal tubular sodium delivery (with furosemide) and principal cell sodium reabsorption and alpha-intercalated cell proton secretion (with fludrocortisone), the investigators induced maximal urinary acidification (urine pH <5.3) in normal subjects. This novel approach could be considered in a challenging diagnostic situation. Distal RTA is associated with hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, and increased risk of nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. Thus, assessment of urine calcium-creatinine ratio and renal ultrasonography are recommended. In addition, rickets, osteomalacia, and growth failure are all potential extrarenal manifestations. Genetic forms of distal RTA may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner, and may occur with or without deafness as a key extrarenal manifestation (Table). There are 2 main forms of gene defects in distal RTA (Figure 2): 1) gene defects in subunits of the apical H* ATPase that is responsible for hydrogen ion secretion into the tubular lumen of the distal nephron, and 2) defects in the chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger, which allows for exchange of bicarbonate across the basolateral lumen to the vasculature. Defects in the apical H* ATPase are associated with sensorineural deafness. In addition to those genetic forms of distal RTA, a combined distal and proximal tubular (type 3) RTA due to carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) mutations can present in infancy or early childhood associated with early-onset nephrocalcinosis, deafness, blindness, and osteopetrosis. Genetic testing and screening for extrarenal manifestations may be considered in distal RTA (Table ). Defective absorption of chloride in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is associated with Bartter syndrome. Defective entry of cysteine into lysosomes is associated with proximal RTA and cystinosis. Proximal tubular cells reabsorb bicarbonate. Therefore, the patient in the vignette is not likely to have defective secretion of hydrogen ion by proximal tubular cells. PREP Pearls + Distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) reflects impaired urinary acidification by the distal nephron. + Anormal anion gap acidosis with a freshly voided urine pH greater than 5.5, and positive urine anion gap indicate distal RTA. + Secondary causes of distal RTA including medications and autoimmune disease are more common in adults, whereas genetic causes are more common in children. Distal RTA increases risk of nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis.

      "serum and urine osmolality The patient in the vignette has many of the classic clinical signs and symptoms of hypokalemia. His muscle weakness and cramping, worsening constipation, and polyuria could all be secondary to hypokalemia. Of note, he may also be demonstrating some other signs of a renal tubular disorder, such as Bartter or Gitelman syndrome, based on the salt craving. A more complete list of clinical features associated with hypokalemia includes muscle weakness and periodic paralysis (especially in the extremities), decreased deep tendon reflexes, muscle cramps, tachypnea, polyuria, metabolic alkalosis, decreased gastrointestinal motility, and arrhythmia with electrocardiographic changes of prolonged PR interval, depressed ST segment, low-magnitude T waves, and the presence of U waves. The evaluation of hypokalemia should include screening for causes related to inadequate potassium intake (eg, severe malnutrition), increased potassium losses, or potassium shifting into cells. Causes of potassium losses from the body would include gastrointestinal losses (eg, vomiting, diarrhea) or renal losses (eg, hereditary or acquired renal tubular transport disorders, diuretics, hyperaldosteronism, or increased mineralocorticoid effect). Disorders that would cause an increased potassium shifting into cells would include hyperinsulinemia, excess &-adrenergic tone, or metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, the testing that will be most helpful to confirm the basis of this patient's symptoms should both confirm the diagnosis of hypokalemia and determine whether the kidneys are the cause (ie, inappropriately elevated urinary potassium in the setting of hypokalemia) or whether his condition has a nonrenal cause (ie, an appropriately low level of potassium in the urine). Therefore, an evaluation of serum and urine electrolytes is the best testing choice for the boy in the vignette. Arterial blood gas, electrocardiography, and serum and urine osmolality are all important considerations for this patient as well. As noted before, metabolic alkalosis can be a cause of hypokalemia, so a blood gas measurement could provide useful information. However, the serum bicarbonate can also be evaluated on the serum electrolyte panel, so a blood gas measurement is not the best choice in the vignette, especially because it will not directly assess the serum or urine potassium levels. Electrocardiography is an important part of the evaluation of patients with hypokalemia, but it is not sensitive or specific to confirm hypokalemia and will not provide information about whether there are inappropriately high urinary losses of potassium. Lastly, given this boy's polydipsia and polyuria, assessing the serum and urine osmolality could be relevant, but this would not explain many of his other symptoms; evaluation of the potassium in the blood and urine would be the more important next step. PREP Pearls + Signs or symptoms of hypokalemia include muscle weakness and periodic paralysis (especially in the extremities), decreased deep tendon reflexes, muscle cramps, tachypnea, polyuria, metabolic alkalosis, decreased gastrointestinal motility, and palpitations/arrhythmia including potential electrocardiographic changes of prolonged PR interval, depressed ST segment, low-magnitude T waves, and presence of U waves. + The evaluation of hypokalemia should include screening for causes related to inadequate potassium intake, increased potassium losses, or potassium shifting into cells.

      "PKD1 NPHP3 PKHD1 HNF1B Hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases are monogenic disorders characterized by fibrocystic abnormalities of the kidney and dysgenesis of the portobiliary tract. The most common type is autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), seen in more than 40%, followed by nephronophthisis. The estimated incidence of ARPKD is 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 20,000 live births. Clinical presentation depends on the severity and includes oligohydramnios, enlarged kidneys, hypertension, and Potter sequence, leading to pulmonary hypoplasia and perinatal death in 30% of affected newborns. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is most commonly caused by mutations in polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1(PKHD7), a large gene extending over a 500-kb genomic segment on chromosome 6p12; consists of 66 exons that encode the fibrocystin/polyductin complex (FPC); and has multiple isoforms expressed in the kidney (collecting ducts and thick ascending loops of Henle) and liver (in bile duct epithelia). In renal tubular and biliary epithelia, FPC localizes to apical membranes, the primary cilia/basal body, and mitotic spindle. The most common is a missense mutation in exon 3, c.107C>T (p.Thr36Met). In ARPKD, renal ultrasonography shows bilateral enlarged echogenic kidneys, and multiple tiny cysts may be visible, which are confined to distal tubules and collecting ducts. Males and females are equally affected. Patients who carry 2 truncating mutations display a severe phenotype with perinatal or neonatal demise; patients surviving the neonatal period carry at least 1 missense mutation. All patients with ARPKD have congenital hepatic fibrosis. In the vignette, the family history, palpable kidneys, and imaging that showed microcysts in the kidney with liver involvement are most compatible with ARPKD. Nephronophthisis (NPHP) in its infantile form can also present with normal or enlarged kidneys, but it is often associated with other congenital anomalies involving the heart, bone, brain, eyes, or digits (Table). The most common extrarenal involvement in NPHP are the eyes. In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), kidneys are not usually enlarged at birth; however, it can mimic ARPKD in 2% of patients with the early-onset severe phenotype when also involving the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta gene encoding transcription factor HNVFB7 (Table). In 2013, the consensus group proposed that the presence of bilateral large echogenic kidneys with poor corticomedullary differentiation and coexisting liver disease on standard diagnostic imaging is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of ARPKD. High- resolution ultrasonography is recommended in the presence of mild disease, and genetic testing may be needed. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with 86% renal survival at age 5 years and 42% at age 20 years. Systemic hypertension is seen in 30% to 75% of patients, hyponatremia in 6% to 79% because of impaired urinary dilution (not sodium wasting) leading to water overload, and urinary tract infections can occur in 20% to 50%. Mutations of hepatorenal cystic disease genes involve the function of the primary cilia or centrosome (Table), therefore it has been termed “ciliopathies.” Emerging evidence shows that cilia dysfunction is the central key to the pathophysiology of polycystic kidney disease. Primary cilia function as mechanosensors that can translate signals into chemical signals affecting cyst development, cyst expansion, and intracellular calcium and sodium signaling. On prenatal or postnatal ultrasonography, ciliopathies can present with bilateral, diffusely echogenic, and/or cystic kidneys. It is important to evaluate for associated congenital abnormalities including polydactyly, brain malformations, and eye abnormalities. The main hepatic pathology in hepatorenal fibrocystic disease consists of 3 main components: defective remodeling of the ductal plate, abnormal portal veins, and progressive fibrosis of portal tracts, which then lead to portal hypertension with hypersplenism (thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, cholangitis), abnormal liver function tests, esophageal varices, and ascending cholangitis. Hepatic involvement can be grouped into: (1) congenital hepatic fibrosis, which affects microscopic bile ducts; (2) Caroli disease, which affects microscopic and medium-sized bile ducts with the presence of focal macroscopic saccular or fusiform dilations of the medium and large intrahepatic bile ducts; and (3) polycystic liver disease, which is the presence of multiple macroscopic cysts in the liver mostly associated with ADPKD. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis and Caroli disease. An increase in liver echogenicity on liver ultrasonography with a coarse homogenous pattern, splenic enlargement, evidence of portal hypertension, and presence of macroscopic cysts are diagnostic of congenital hepatic fibrosis or Caroli disease. Liver biopsy (not necessary for diagnosis) shows abnormal portal tracts, abnormal-shaped embryonic bile ducts, abnormal portal vein, and periportal fibrosis without inflammation. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is caused by mutations in PKD7 and PKD2.1 in 500 to 1,000 mutations of PKD7 in 85% encoding polycystin protein, which interacts with polycystin 2, the protein product of PKD2. Autosomal recessive tubulointerstitial disorders present with renal cysts in the corticomedullary junction caused by mutations in the nephronophthisis (NPHP) gene which encode nephrocystins. HNFB7 is a transcription factor that participates in tissue-specific regulation of gene expression in various organs including the kidney, liver, biliary duct, pancreas, and genital organs. HVFB7 can affect PKHD7, PKD2, and UMOD, so it may resemble ARPKD or ADPKD. PREP Pearls + In 2013, the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) consensus group recommended that the findings of bilateral large echogenic kidneys with poor corticomedullary differentiation and coexisting liver disease on ultrasonography is sufficient for the diagnosis of ARPKD. + Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is most commonly caused by mutations in the PKHD7 gene.

      "there is less than 10% chance of detecting a mutation The patient in the vignette has the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure, which define hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low haptoglobin, and schistocytes on peripheral smear confirm the diagnosis. The absence of diarrhea and negative result on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia colitesting should raise suspicion for atypical (rather than shiga/enterohemorrhagic toxin-associated) HUS (aHUS). The normal ADAMTS13 level makes a diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (which can present with similar features) unlikely. The presence of autoantibodies to factor H identified in the patient in the vignette is typical of as many as 25% to 50% of children who present with aHUS. A copy number variation with deletion of CFHR 7/3is associated with the presence of anti-factor H antibodies and thus is the preferred response. Mutations in DGKE have been found in up to 27% of infants with aHUS and typically present before age 1 year. Mutations in M@CPare associated with a lower risk of recurrence than factor H and | mutations. To date, reports from most series of patients with aHUS indicate that more than 50% of patients will have an identifiable mutation. Depending on the study, between 30% and 50% of patients with aHUS may have no identifiable mutations. Genetic studies over the past 2 decades have advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology and role of alternative complement activation in aHUS. The alternative complement pathway is activated by cleavage of soluble complement component C3 into C3a and C3b in plasma. Activation of the alternative complement pathway is a component of the innate immune system and occurs via a constant “tick-over” cleavage. Cleaved C3b deposits on cell surfaces, where it binds with factor Bb (cleaved from factor B by factor D), forming C3 convertase. This amplifies the response by further cleavage of C3. Multiple cleaved C3b products combine with Bb to form the C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 and allows for the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC induces cell death and lysis. Excessive activation of the alternative complement system is kept in check by multiple regulatory proteins, including factors H and | and MCP/CD46 (factor H prevents binding of C3b to cell surfaces, and together, factor H, factor I, and MCP/CD46 degrade C3b). Multiple defects in genes encoding proteins that regulate the alternative complement system are associated with aHUS (Figure). Anti-factor H autoantibodies are present in 25% to 50% of cases of aHUS, depending on the case series. Complement factor H-related proteins (CFHRs) are highly homologous to complement factor H and to one another. This high degree of homology makes the CFHR region a recombinant hot spot, and thus copy number variants (deletions) in the region are common. It also can result in nonallelic recombination errors leading to formation of “hybrid” proteins. Both deletions and hybrid proteins are associated with aHUS. The deletion of CFHR 7/is associated with formation of anti-factor H autoantibodies, possibly because of loss of anergy. In addition to mutations in the complement pathways, mutations in DGkKF were recently identified in patients with aHUS. Many of these patients were infants who presented with aHUS in the first year after birth. The precise mechanism by which loss of DGkF results in aHUS is not fully understood, but it is thought that it leads to a prothrombotic state. The prevalence of genetic mutations among patients with aHUS has been reported by multiple groups (Table). The prevalence of mutations likely varies with the population studied; in 1 series of patients with aHUS, no one mutation accounted for more than 20% of the cases. Between 3% and 5% of patients may carry mutations in more than 1 complement component. While the understanding of the clinical phenotype associated with genetic mutations continues to evolve, several genotype-phenotype associates have been identified: * Complement factor H mutations are among those most commonly associated with aHUS and typically have a high risk of recurrence. + Because MCP is predominantly expressed in the kidney, patients with mutations in MCP/CD46 have a lower risk of recurrence after transplantation. However, other genes have more variable phenotypes. For example, in a study of DGKE mutations, some patients had remission of HUS without treatment, whereas others progressed despite eculizumab treatment and complete blockade of the alternative complement pathway. Most patients developed proteinuric nephropathy and only 20% progressed to end-stage renal disease by 10 years after diagnosis. Genetics have implications for therapeutic options also. Eculizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for aHUS therapy in 2011. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds terminal complement component 5. This prevents its cleavage and thus formation of the membrane attack (MAC) C5b-9 complex. Before eculizumab therapy, most patients (almost 80%) with atypical HUS died or developed chronic or end-stage kidney disease within 3 years of diagnosis. Eculizumab has markedly improved the prognosis for aHUS; however, the high cost as well as challenges of long-term administration of an intravenous medication have raised the controversial question of whether eculizumab can be stopped in some patients. Some investigators have reported increased extrarenal manifestations of aHUS with eculizumab cessation, while others report successful cessation of eculizumab in select groups of patients. With longer-term follow-up, there is evolving knowledge of the clinical implications of various genetic mutations and their response to eculizumab and other therapies, risk for recurrence after eculizumab cessation, and risks associated with living related donor transplantation. Gene mutations may also help predict risk of aHUS recurrence either after the cessation of eculizumab and/or after transplantation (Table). Patients without identifiable complement pathway mutations appear to have the lowest risk of recurrence. A recent Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference recommendation was that genetic testing for mutations in CFH, CD46, CFI, C3, CFB, THBD, CFHR1, CFHRS, and DGkE be performed in patients with aHUS as well as testing for copy number variants and hybrid CFHR genes. In children, they recommended that genetic testing should not delay treatment with eculizumab to maximize preservation of renal function. Many of the mutations result in disease in heterozygotes; however, there is variable penetrance, suggesting that a “second hit” may be required to initiate aHUS. Some studies suggest that 50% of people may carry a genetic variant in complement genes. Indeed, as many as 20% of African Americans and 3% to 6% of Europeans have homozygous CFHR7 and CFHR3 deletion. Yet aHUS is a rare disease. Recent single nucleotide polymorphisms (CFH-H3 and MCPggaac) were identified, which are associated with an increased penetrance of disease. The KDIGO guidelines recommended testing for these haplotypes in affected individuals. In providing genetic counseling to families, practitioners should continue to review the evolving literature as new genotype-phenotype correlations are discovered to provide up-to-date information about the risk of relapse (pre/post-transplant) and response to therapy. The KDIGO recommendations suggest that the highest risk of post-transplantation recurrence (>50%) is with a known pathogenic or gain-of- function mutation. No mutations, isolated complement factor | mutations, or mutations in which the significance is not known are considered to be of moderate risk (10%-50%). MCP/CD46 mutations are considered to have the lowest risk of recurrence (<10%). Testing of family members is indicated in the setting of live donor renal transplantation, where live donation can only be considered if the donor has no genetic mutations associated with aHUS. PREP Pearls * Genetic defects in the alternative complement pathway are associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). + Pathogenic genetic defects in the complement pathway are associated with a higher rate of aHUS recurrence. + DGkE mutations are most commonly seen in infants presenting before age 1 year with aHUS.

      "“starry sky” pattern deposition of C3 The patient in the vignette presents with recurrent episodes of gross hematuria with concurrent infection and has a red blood cell cast on urine microscopy. He has normal renal function, normal blood pressure, and no extrarenal manifestations. Complements are normal. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is immunoglobulin (lg) A nephropathy, and the preferred response is mesangial deposition of IgA. Linear deposition of IgG is associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, which would be expected to have a more severe course with decline in renal function. Negative immunofluorescence may occur in glomerular diseases such as minimal change disease, hereditary nephritis or pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, but these are less likely diagnoses in this case. “Starry sky” pattern deposition of C3 would be suggestive of postinfectious glomerulonephritis, but the patient in the vignette has normal blood pressure and serum complements, making this less likely. Although clinical history, light and electron microscopy all contribute, patterns of immunofluorescence are important for the final interpretation of a renal biopsy. IgA nephropathy and anti-GBM nephritis are 2 examples in which immunofluorescence is key to the diagnosis. For native kidney biopsies, immunofluorescence is typically performed for IgG, IgA, IgM, % light chains, A light chains, C3, C4, C1q, and fibrin/fibrinogen. Common patterns of glomerular immunofluorescence (IF) staining include: 1. Capillary wall (following the glomerular capillary loops) (Figure 2) 2. Mesangial (in the mesangial space) (Figure 3) Mesangial and capillary loop IF patterns are shown in Figure 4. Capillary wall staining may be: + Linear, with smooth deposition along the basement membrane, as in anti- GBM nephritis. * Granular, with discrete areas of deposition. Fine granular staining that involves both mesangium and capillary loops may appear as a “starry sky pattern” as in postinfectious glomerulonephritis. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis can also have “garland” staining (heavy deposition along the capillary loops). If the staining is contiguous along capillary loops, it may appear “band-like” or even “pseudolinear.” Mesangial deposition of immunoglobulin and complement component C3 can occur in various glomerular diseases (Table). IgA nephropathy typically presents with dominant IgA staining in the mesangium, whereas dominant C3 staining is the diagnostic criterion for C3 glomerulonephritis. IgA nephropathy may also have lesser degrees of mesangial C3, IgG, and IgM deposition. Proliferative forms of IgA nephropathy may have fine granular staining of capillary loops with IgA.
