    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis, likely secondary to impaired responsiveness to aldosterone in the setting of urinary tract obstruction with or without pyelonephritis. Evaluation to exclude other causes may be indicated, but the most important step in the face of hyperkalemia is immediate management to prevent cardiac dysrhythmia and to bring the serum potassium level to a safer range. In this case, given the normal electrocardiographic findings, management should be aimed toward fostering excretion of potassium. Given the patient’s normal creatinine level, it should be possible to stimulate renal excretion of potassium. This can be done with a loop diuretic and/or sodium supplementation. However, given the recent history of febrile illness and a slightly low serum sodium concentration, sodium supplementation would be the more optimal choice because it may simultaneously address the hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and the need to maintain circulating volume in this patient. Potassium excretion by the kidney is regulated in the principal cell of the distal nephron’s collecting tubules and cortical collecting ducts. These cells have an epithelial sodium channel that can be stimulated either by aldosterone or by increased tubular flow rate of sodium. In stimulating this channel, sodium reabsorption is increased, leaving a lumen negative charge, which in turn, stimulates potassium secretion from potassium channels of\n\nthe principal cell. Therefore, sodium supplementation should increase sodium delivery to the principal cell, and thereby enhance renal potassium excretion through an aldosterone-independent mechanism. Loop diuretics can stimulate potassium excretion through the same mechanism. However, in this infant, a loop diuretic would lead to increased sodium losses in the urine and a resulting decrease in circulating volume, which might be undesirable. Assessing urine electrolytes before and after administration of fludrocortisone, an exogenous mineralocorticoid, as well as obtaining serum cortisol and aldosterone levels may help determine or confirm the cause of this patient’s hyperkalemia. These may be considered important parts of this patient’s evaluation, but they are not the most important next step in management for this patient’s renal tubular acidosis with hyperkalemia. PREP Pearls If the glomerular filtration rate is normal or near normal, renal tubular acidosis with hyperkalemia can be managed through mechanisms that enhance renal excretion of potassium. Either potassium-wasting diuretics and/or sodium supplementation can be used to enhance renal potassium excretion through increasing renal tubular flow rate of sodium and stimulating sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the principal cell via an aldosterone-independent mechanism. The clinical context can assist in deciding between the use of potassium wasting diuretics (eg, in volume excess states) vs sodium supplementation (in volume-depleted states) to assist in renal potassium excretion.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has end-stage kidney disease and is receiving maintenance dialysis with new-onset hematuria. Although he has a family history of urolithiasis, the major concern in a patient with hematuria who is receiving long-term dialysis is acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) with or without malignancy. Acquired cystic kidney disease of native kidneys can also occur after kidney transplantation.\n\nIn a patient with advanced chronic kidney disease, the diagnosis of ACKD requires the presence of 4 or more renal cysts affecting both kidneys. The incidence of ACKD is directly proportional to the severity of chronic kidney disease (7% predialysis vs 22% on dialysis). Duration of end-stage renal disease/dialysis correlates positively with the appearance of renal cysts on ultrasonography. Males and black patients tend to have a higher incidence of ACKD as well as larger cysts. The cause of ESRD or the modality of dialysis or the type of post-transplant immunosuppression has no significant impact on the risk of cyst development. Most patients exhibit gross hematuria. Anuric patients may have bilateral flank pain because of cyst enlargement and bleeding. Acquired cystic kidney disease can be differentiated from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (absence of family history and the small size of kidneys). About 1.6% of patients with ACKD develop renal cell carcinoma (RCC), approximately 6-fold higher than the general population, especially patients receiving long-term dialysis (>10 years). Patients with numerous cysts, complex cysts, or larger cysts are at a higher risk of progression to RCC. Interestingly, the prevalence of mutations in the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is not increased in RCC samples from patients with ACKD compared with the general population. Recommendations for screening for ACKD in patients receiving dialysis and transplant recipients is to obtain a baseline screening renal ultrasound scan in patients with end-stage renal disease around 3 years after the initiation of dialysis. If initial ultrasonography finding is negative for cysts, repeat renal ultrasonography is recommended every 3 years or if symptoms arise. In patients with 1 to 3 simple cysts, yearly renal ultrasonography is recommended. Patients with complex cysts should have contrast-enhanced computed tomography to look for neoplastic lesions. The role of noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging in the follow-up of these lesions has not been established. PREP Pearls\n\nAcquired renal cysts occur in more than 50% of patients with end-stage renal disease who are receiving maintenance dialysis, or in native kidneys after transplantation, for more than 5 years. Acquired renal cysts are usually asymptomatic, and may present with hematuria, but also with flank pain or urinary tract infection. The diagnosis of acquired cystic kidney disease requires the presence of 4 or more cysts affecting both kidneys. Patients with end-stage renal disease who are receiving maintenance dialysis should be screened for renal cysts using renal ultrasonography 3 years after the initiation of dialysis.

    "explanation": "Hydroxyurea is a strongly recommended medication for many patients with sickle cell disease. The reported renal benefits of hydroxyurea include improvement in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), less hyperfiltration, and lower rates of proteinuria. Of note, the medication can interfere with serum creatinine levels if measured by a point-of-care handheld blood analyzer device. The mechanism of hydroxyurea is not fully understood. The primary cellular target is ribonucleotide reductase enzyme, which is used in DNA synthesis and repair. By blocking the function of the enzyme, the drug causes arrest of the cell cycle and can lead to cell death. Other effects of hydroxyurea include increasing hemoglobin F production and nitric oxide, and reducing the proportion of reticulocytes and the number of white blood cells, leading to reduced vaso-occlusion. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines, hydroxyurea is recommended for all infants older than 9 months, children, and adolescents. It should also be considered in infants younger than 9 months or adults with symptomatic disease. Hydroxyurea can help with many of the complications in sickle cell disease, including reducing the episodes of vaso-occlusive crises and kidney disease. In the long term, there can be improved survival and quality of life. The main adverse effect of hydroxyurea is myelosuppression. Clinically, patients may experience gastrointestinal toxicity. The main site of injury in sickle cell nephropathy is the renal medulla, which receives blood supply from the vasa recta capillaries. Due to the relatively hypoxic conditions, these capillaries contribute to a favorable environment for sickling. As a result of the vascular effects, patients develop renal medullary ischemia and infarction. When sickling affects the concentration mechanisms in the medulla, there is impairment of the urinary concentrating ability. Often as infants, patients are found to have iso- or hyposthenuria, leading to polyuria and enuresis. As patients age, the renal involvement also progresses. In early childhood, there may be increased glomerular pressure and glomerular hyperfiltration. They can also develop a distal renal tubular acidosis with hyperkalemia. Acute kidney injury can occur and be multifactorial. These patients are often at increased risk due to hypovolemia,\n\nnephrotoxic medications, urinary obstruction, and complications from iron overload. Older children are more likely to start developing microalbuminuria and hematuria. In later adulthood, patients can develop worsening renal disease with a small percentage progressing to end-stage renal disease. Sickle cell nephropathy is a term used to describe the wide range of renal pathology seen in patients with sickle cell disease and is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Hematuria remains one of the most common renal findings in sickle cell disease. Microscopic hematuria occurs in approximately 30% of patients. Gross hematuria raises concern for more serious complications. Infarction along with papillary necrosis can be common in patients with sickle cell disease and is often associated with additional risk factors, including infection, obstructive uropathy, diabetes mellitus, and analgesic use. For diagnosis of papillary necrosis, a definitive diagnosis often requires a computed tomography scan but is not always necessary. Management depends on the degree of hematuria. Proteinuria, which often develops later in life, can be related to tubular dysfunction, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. According to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), 16% to 27% of children with sickle cell nephropathy have chronic kidney disease. The Table includes a complete list of clinical manifestations in sickle cell nephropathy. Folic acid is also a common medication used in sickle cell disease but would not help with his sickle cell nephropathy. Deferasirox is indicated in sickle cell disease to treat iron overload related to transfusions. This drug has a large number of adverse effects, including rash, gastrointestinal toxicity, proteinuria, and increased creatinine levels. However, in the vignette, the patient did not have a history of any recent transfusions, so this drug would unlikely be indicated. Finally, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition is recommended in patients with sickle cell disease with persistent proteinuria. The most common adverse effects are increased creatinine levels,\n\nhypotension, dizziness, cough, and hyperkalemia. In the vignette, the patient has normal blood pressure and no microalbuminuria (despite trace protein on urine strip testing), suggesting that lisinopril is not indicated. PREP Pearls Hematuria is the most common renal finding in sickle cell disease, and gross hematuria is concerning for more serious complications. The main site of injury in sickle cell nephropathy is the renal medulla. Hydroxyurea can be beneficial in patients with sickle cell disease and sickle cell nephropathy, and it can improve survival and quality of life.

    "explanation": "The boy in the vignette has a rare complication of lupus—lupus cystitis. Lupus cystitis results from immune complex vasculitis of the small vessels of the bladder. Although infection (with either a parasite or bacteria) can result in a thickened bladder wall, it should not cause hydronephrosis or hydroureter. Further, there is no history of fever or travel and the urine culture is negative. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause transverse myelitis. Lupus-induced sacral spinal cord inflammation can lead to impaired bladder sensation and paralysis, which might cause vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, and hydroureter. However, one would expect additional symptoms including weakness, numbness, tingling, coldness, or burning in the arms or legs, and bladder and bowel incontinence. Posterior urethral valves with urethral obstruction can cause bilateral hydronephrosis with a thickened bladder wall but is more likely to present during infancy. Lupus cystitis is much less common than lupus nephritis, reportedly affecting an estimated 0.02% to 2% of patients with lupus. However, lupus cystitis symptoms are often subtle and therefore, its true prevalence may be\n\nunderestimated. Women are more likely to be affected than men and represent 90% of lupus cystitis cases. Elevated double-stranded DNA antibodies are present in three-quarters of patients. Patients with lupus cystitis may be more likely to have central nervous system involvement of their lupus or lupus enteritis. Lupus cystitis can occur in both children and adults, and onset sometimes precedes the diagnosis of lupus. Patients with lupus cystitis may first present with gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. Typically, bowel and bladder involvement coexist. Frequency and urgency are the most common urinary complaints. The frequency may be severe (multiple small voids during the day). Other symptoms include suprapubic pain, nocturia, or dysuria. Diagnosis of lupus cystitis typically involves urinary tract imaging. Urinalysis may show hematuria or be normal. Hydronephrosis (Figure 1) and hydroureter may be present on imaging. For diagnosis, lupus cystitis is characterized by bladder inflammation. Typical findings on abdominal and pelvic computed tomography are bladder wall thickening (Figure 2), decreased bladder capacity, bowel wall thickening, ascites, and the presence of “target” sign and/or “comb” signs. A target sign is when the thickened bowel wall demonstrates 3 layers: a contrast-enhanced inner and outer layer of high attenuation between which is a decreased attenuation layer. A “comb” sign is when inflammation in the mesentery outlines the distended intestinal arcades with increased densities, leading to the appearance of the “teeth of the comb.” Although lupus cystitis pathogenesis is not fully understood, immune complex—mediated vasculitis is thought to be the main factor. On pathology, there is leukocytic infiltration of the bladder vessel walls and deposition of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q. While there is no one standard, treatment of lupus cystitis typically includes immunosuppression. Use of pulse steroids, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab have all been reported. Caution may be\n\nindicated with the use of intravenous cyclophosphamide, given the risk for hemorrhagic cystitis. Use of other agents including cetirizine hydrochloride (used also to stabilize mast cells in chronic interstitial cystitis) have been reported in small case series. In addition to lupus cystitis, the bladder can be affected by neurologic lupus involvement (eg, transverse myelopathy, inflammatory polyneuropathy) or as side effects of treatments (eg, cyclophosphamide administration and infections. Although not specific to lupus, chronic interstitial cystitis may have an autoimmune etiology. PREP Pearls Lupus cystitis is a rare complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus cystitis often first presents with gastrointestinal symptoms. Typical findings of lupus cystitis on imaging are hydronephrosis, bladder wall thickening, decreased bladder capacity, bowel wall thickening, ascites, and a “target” sign and/or “comb” sign on computed tomography.

    "explanation": "The patient in this vignette has recurrent nephrolithiasis despite having adequate urine output and alkalinization of his urine, and thus was started on tiopronin. The patient now has edema, hypoalbuminemia, and proteinuria consistent with nephrotic syndrome. The most likely cause for his proteinuria is tiopronin, which was started 9 months ago.\n\nTiopronin (α-mercaptopropionylglycine) and D-penicillamine are cystine- binding thiol drugs that are used in patients with cystinuria when increased fluid intake, dietary changes, and urinary alkalinization strategies have failed to decrease stone production. These thiol-binding agents form mixed disulfide-cysteine complexes, which are approximately 50 times more soluble than cystine. Adverse effects of tiopronin are common, with approximately 80% of patients reporting one adverse effect. Cutaneous adverse effects (eg, pemphigus, erythema, pruritus, rashes) appear in approximately 30% of patients, proteinuria in 25%, gastrointestinal in 25%, and hematological (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) in 15% of patients. Kidney biopsies performed in patients with proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome on tiopronin had findings consistent with membranous nephropathy in the majority of patients, although minimal change disease and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis have also occasionally been described. In the majority of patients, nephrotic syndrome resolves after stopping tiopronin even though nephrotic syndrome can be severe. The adverse effects can be minimized by starting at a lower dose and gradually increasing the dose. After starting tiopronin, laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and urine protein:creatinine ratio should be monitored frequently in the first 3 months, and every few months after that for the first 1 to 2 years. Afterward, if no adverse effects are identified, annual laboratory studies are acceptable. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was diagnosed at the age of 12 years with a 2 glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 41 mL/min/1.73 m , and he did not have 2 proteinuria at that visit. Currently, he has a GFR of 43 mL/min/1.73 m , which has not significantly worsened since presentation and moreover, CKD does not cause nephrotic-range proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome. Orthostatic proteinuria is characterized by proteinuria in an upright position and normal protein excretion in a recumbent position. The precise pathophysiology of orthostatic proteinuria is not clearly understood, but an exaggerated glomerular hemodynamic response in the upright position has been\n\ndescribed and is considered as the probable cause in these patients. Orthostatic proteinuria is considered benign based on long-term studies of these patients. Alkalinizing therapy (potassium citrate) is commonly prescribed in patients with cystinuria for urinary alkalinization. Cystine is highly insoluble in urine, but its solubility increases when the urine pH is between 7 and 7.5. Approximately 10% of patients treated with alkalinizing therapy develop adverse effects, which are primarily gastrointestinal and include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Potassium citrate does not cause nephrotic syndrome or proteinuria. α-Lipoic acid, a nutritional supplement, has shown to decrease cystine stone formation in a mouse model of cystinuria. In patients, α-lipoic acid has been shown to improve cystine solubility. It has the potential to be a novel therapeutic agent in cystinuria, and there is currently an ongoing trial in adults with cystinuria. In summary, the patient developed membranous nephropathy from tiopronin. PREP Pearls Adverse events with tiopronin are frequent, and proteinuria can be severe. It is recommended to start at lower doses and increase the dose as tolerated. Monitor for proteinuria by frequent urine test strips or urine protein:creatinine ratio. Proteinuria resolves with cessation of tiopronin in the majority of patients. Alkalinizing therapy in general is well tolerated.

    "explanation": "The infant in the vignette has clinical features of renal-coloboma syndrome, including renal impairment and coloboma. Colobomas with defects in the iris give the pupil a “keyhole” appearance (Figure 1). Renal coloboma syndrome is associated with autosomal dominant heterozygous PAX2 mutations. Renal manifestations may include small and underdeveloped (hypoplastic) kidneys, vesicoureteral reflux, kidney cysts, and/or as in the vignette,\n\noligomeganephronia. The definitive diagnosis of oligomeganephronia requires renal pathology. Oligomeganephronia is characterized by normal- appearing but fewer nephrons with glomerulomegaly. In oligomeganephronia, glomeruli may be twice the normal size (Figure 2). Cysts at the corticomedullary border are typical of nephronophthisis, which is not a manifestation of renal coloboma syndrome. Segmental glomerular tuft collapse with overlying visceral epithelial hyperplasia would be a finding in collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis can be seen with PAX2 mutations; however, collapsing FSGS is not typical. Thickened glomerular basement membrane can be a manifestation of diseases such as diabetic nephropathy; diabetes is not a morbidity associated with renal-coloboma syndrome. Oligomeganephronia is a rare congenital form of bilateral renal hypoplasia. Compared with renal dysplasia, the kidneys lack abnormal structures but exhibit 80% fewer nephrons with hypertrophied glomeruli. Approximately two-thirds of patients with oligomeganephronia are seen with symptoms before age 20 years (Table). In cases without a known genetic cause, the birth history is often notable for low birth weight. The pregnancy may have been complicated by premature birth, intrauterine growth restriction, maternal diabetes or hypertension, maternal exposures (inhibitors of the renin- angiotensin system or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, smoking, or alcohol). In severe cases, renal impairment may be already present in the perinatal period and lead to pneumothorax (presumably because of impaired lung development), feeding difficulties, urinary salt wasting, electrolyte abnormalities, and poor growth. However, most cases do not present in infancy. The most common clinical presentation is asymptomatic proteinuria. The kidneys often appear small and echogenic on renal ultrasonography. Definitive diagnosis of oligomeganephronia requires histopathology. Although glomerulomegaly can also occur with other conditions, such as obesity-associated FSGS, oligomeganephronia is characterized by a more\n\nsevere phenotype. Glomerular diameter and volume are 2 to 3 times the normal size. The Bowman capsule may also appear thickened and tubules also appear hypertrophied. As the disease progresses, focal segmental sclerosis (secondary) and tubulointerstitial fibrosis may occur. Gene defects may contribute to oligomeganephronia (Table). In addition to PAX2 mutations, oligomeganephronia has been associated with autosomal dominant heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-beta (HNF1B). HNF1B is also known as transcription factor-2 (TCF2). Of note, beyond oligomeganephronia, HNF1B mutations are associated with markedly variable renal phenotypes, including renal cysts and diabetes syndrome, isolated hyperechogenic kidneys with normal or slightly enhanced size, hyperuricemia and hypomagnesemia, and hypoplastic glomerulocystic kidney disease. Treatment options are limited. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers) may be used to try to delay progressive loss of kidney function. However, progressive loss of kidney function is the norm, with mean onset of end-stage kidney disease at 10 years of age (it can occur as early as 6 months or well into adulthood). PREP Pearls Oligomeganephronia is a rare condition that most often presents with asymptomatic proteinuria and leads to childhood-onset end-stage kidney disease. Diagnosis of oligomeganephronia requires histopathology showing markedly reduced glomerular number with glomerular size that is 2 to 3 times larger than normal. Oligomeganephronia may occur in association with genetic defects including PAX2 or HNF1B mutations.

    "explanation": "Edema results from an imbalance of Starling forces, most notably intravascular hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure as well as interstitial hydrostatic pressure. The latter could be increased, for example, from impaired venous or lymphatic drainage, leading to edema. Increased intravascular hydrostatic pressure, as occurs in fluid volume overload, may result in edema. Conversely, decreased intravascular oncotic pressure, as occurs with hypoalbuminemia, may result in edema. Edema may be localized to a disrupted region (eg, impaired lymphatic drainage localized to an extremity), or may be systemic (eg, as in hypoalbuminemia). Additionally,\n\ndecreased vascular integrity (eg, from a capillary leak syndrome, as occurs in sepsis) may also lead to edema formation. The edema in such cases may be accentuated by leakage of serum proteins into the interstitium, increasing interstitial oncotic pressure relative to intravascular oncotic pressure. Ascites refers to a localized collection of fluid or localized edema to the abdomen, whereas anasarca refers to widespread systemic edema. The neonate in the vignette has a predominance of ascites rather than anasarca, pointing toward an etiology that relates to gastrointestinal or urinary tract origin, such as rupture of a congenitally obstructed urinary tract or a gastrointestinal perforation. Abdominal ultrasonography would be a non- invasive, generally available, helpful tool that could identify the pathologic origin of this neonate’s edema. A peritoneal fluid creatinine level would be elevated and could be diagnostic in the case of a ruptured urinary tract, however this would be an invasive maneuver in a critically ill neonate and may not be an appropriate first step if imaging clearly identified a gastrointestinal etiology. If the neonate had more widespread edema or anasarca, it may be worth it to consider causes such as heart failure (either from congenital heart disease or hemolytic anemia/alloimmunization), sepsis, or congenital nephrotic syndrome. In this case echocardiography may be a diagnostic test of choice. However, this neonate’s localized edema and requirement for oscillatory ventilation limits the utility of this modality. Aneuploidy, which could be diagnosed through a karyotype, is a common cause of hydrops, or widespread edema in the fetus, but it would not be the most likely etiology for this living neonate without signs of dysmorphism. Management decisions will depend on the specific etiology, however it is essential to support intravascular volume, cardiac output, and organ function, as well as mobilization of ascites, if possible, through sodium restriction, colloid infusion such as blood products or albumin (if applicable), and a balance between use of hemodynamic supportive agents like pressors and/or diuretics.\n\nPREP Pearls Edema results from an imbalance of Starling forces, most notably intravascular hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure, and also interstitial hydrostatic pressure.

    "explanation": "Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a serious and potentially fatal complication in the post-transplant period, characterized by lymphoid or plasmacytic proliferation that occurs as a result of immunosuppression in the setting of solid organ transplantation. In most affected patients, there is B-cell proliferation in patients who are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive, related to the degree of chronic immunosuppression. Epstein-Barr virus-negative tumors and T-cell tumors may also occur. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a continuum of disease and has been categorized as follows by the World Health Organization classification system: Early lesions: presenting as an acute infectious mononucleosis-type illness with polyclonal B cell proliferation and no evidence of malignant transformation. Polymorphic PTLD: polyclonal or monoclonal lymphoid infiltrates with evidence of malignant transformation but not meeting all criteria for B- cell or T-/natural killer–cell lymphomas recognized in immunocompetent patients. Monomorphic PTLD: monoclonal lymphoid proliferations meeting criteria for B-cell or T-/natural killer–cell lymphomas recognized in immunocompetent patients. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma-like PTLD: the least common form. Attention to limiting exposure to aggressive immunosuppression by complete withdrawal or rapid tapering of immunosuppressive agents to maintenance target concentrations is associated with lower incidence of PTLD. Because the\n\ndevelopment of PTLD is also related to infection with EBV as well as cytomegalovirus (CMV), anti-viral prophylaxis may also help with PTLD prevention, particularly among high-risk EBV-negative recipients of EBV- positive donor organs, although data regarding its efficacy is limited. Routine EBV monitoring for early detection of EBV infection followed by aggressive treatment, with antiviral therapy and lowering immunosuppression, are also recommended measures that lower incidence of PTLD. After diagnosis, a combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is recommended for information regarding the extent of disease activity and staging. For suspected central nervous system involvement, further evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging of the head with gadolinium and cerebrospinal fluid analysis is recommended. Echocardiography is warranted to assess cardiac function in patients with a history of cardiac disease. Management varies with the aggressiveness and type of the PTLD, graft function, the immunosuppressive regimen used, the potential impact of graft failure, and associated comorbidities in the patient. The main goal of therapy is to balance 2 potentially conflicting scenarios: PTLD eradication vs graft function preservation. There is no convincing evidence that antiviral therapy is efficacious in the treatment of established PTLD, even though antiviral prophylaxis may decrease the incidence of PTLD. Treatment usually involves a varying combination of the following; there is paucity of data regarding the efficacy of different treatment options. Immunosuppression reduction: Early, aggressive, near-complete withdrawal of immunosuppression, if tolerated, is associated with resolution, especially in early lesions with no evidence of malignant transformation. The practice varies with the institution; often the calcineurin inhibitor and the anti-metabolite is discontinued, while low- dose prednisone is continued. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies: Rituximab has become a key component in the treatment of CD20+ve PTLD (as in the patient in the vignette) and is often effective when used alone along with immunosuppression reduction specially in polymorphic lesions. The\n\nmajor adverse effects of rituximab include infusion reactions, neutropenia, infections, and risk of hepatitis B reactivation among hepatitis B surface-antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B core-antibody (anti- HBc)–positive patients. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is often used in conjunction with rituximab, sequentially or concurrently, in CD20+ve PTLD patients, especially with monomorphic lesions, or alone in CD20-ve PTLD. No randomized trial exists comparing the different chemotherapy regimens and the ideal timing, although the CHOP regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) is frequently used. Other chemotherapy regimens are also used, and the choice is usually made based on adverse effect profile and physician experience. Radiation: Radiation is beneficial in patients with localized disease and those with CNS involvement. Adoptive immunotherapy: EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes (EBV- CTLs) or donor-lymphocyte infusion (DLI) may be used, in cases with persistent disease despite initial therapy, in an attempt to kill dividing B cells in EBV-associated PTLD. The major complication of DLI (not EBV-CTLs) is acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease, EBV-CTLs, however, are not available at many centers. Surgery: This is reserved for patients with complications such as obstruction or perforation. There is a lack of pediatric data regarding outcomes of patients with PTLD; overall survival rates are thought to range between 75% and 85%. Poor prognostic factors include histology and clonality (monomorphic or T-cell histology), diagnosis within 6 months from transplant, extent of disease (central nervous system or serous membrane invasion), multiple versus single sites, increasing age, higher serum creatinine at diagnosis, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. PREP Pearls Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a serious complication in the post-transplant period, characterized by lymphoid or plasmacytic proliferation and occurring as a result of immunosuppression in the setting of solid organ transplantation.

    "explanation": "Vascular access is paramount for providing hemodialysis treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. Catheters are most frequently used for vascular access in adults and children for incident hemodialysis patients. However, it is important to note that catheters should be viewed as a bridge to permanent access or until alternative treatment options are made available (eg, peritoneal dialysis or renal transplant). Catheter avoidance is the goal for all hemodialysis patients. Adult and pediatric studies have shown that catheters are associated with overall increased morbidity and risk for infectious (sepsis) and noninfectious complications (eg, thrombosis, malfunction). Borzych-Duzalka et al. analysed 552 children and adolescents on maintenance hemodialysis enrolled prospectively in the International Pediatric Hemodialysis Network (IPHN) Registry and reported on 628 central venous catheters, 225 arteriovenous fistulas, and 17 arteriovenous grafts for 314 cumulative patient-years. They reported statistically significant higher blood flow rates and dialysis clearance (Kt/Vurea) with permanent access (fistula 1.71 and graft 2.02) than with catheters (1.64). Infectious complications were reported only with catheters (1.3/1,000 catheter-days) and not with permanent access. Furthermore, infectious complications led to vascular access replacement in 47% of the patients in the study cohort. Dysfunction rates were also significantly higher with catheters (2.5/1,000 catheter-days) compared to arterio-venous fistulas (1.2/1,000 fistula-days). Also, catheters required 82% more revisions and almost 3-fold more vascular access replacements to a different site than fistulas. Depending on the expertise of the surgeon, fistulas have been placed in children as small as 15 kg. A plan for scheduled renal transplantation and time to maturation of permanent access (6 weeks to months for AV fistula) is considered a reason to favor catheters and forego consideration for permanent access. However, the unpredictability of renal transplantation has been highlighted in pediatric studies. In one study, nearly one-third of prevalent patients dialyzed with a catheter did not undergo transplantation within a year, and only 10% had\n\n“transplant scheduled” as a reason for catheter placement. In their analysis of patients enrolled in IPHN registry, Borzych-Duzalka et al. reported a median wait time of 14 months for transplantation in patients with catheters, and nearly 25% of the patients remained on dialysis for more than 3 years. Treatment decisions for children with end-stage renal disease should consider the many years of renal replacement therapy needed even in children undergoing renal transplant early on in their renal failure journey. To this end, preserving vascular access by limiting catheter use and thereby decreasing the risk of stenosis or vessel injury with repeated catheter replacement is the goal for all children initiating dialysis with a catheter. Furthermore, this approach decreases a patient's risk for increased morbidity and complications associated with catheters. In this patient, the central venous catheter should be viewed as a bridge to other options for renal replacement therapy. Renal transplant is the preferred treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease, and the team could plan for the same in a fixed time interval (possibly 6 months). However, if barriers (medical, social, or other patient factors) are identified that prevent a quick path to renal transplant, then the plan should be catheter-free dialysis at the earliest. The options in this scenario would include switching to peritoneal dialysis or planning for permanent access with an arteriovenous fistula or graft. PREP Pearls Central venous catheters are associated with overall increased morbidity and risk for infectious (sepsis) and noninfectious complications (thrombosis, malfunction). Catheters should be viewed as a bridge to permanent access or until alternative treatment options are made available (peritoneal dialysis or renal transplant).

    "explanation": "The complement system is part of the innate immune system. It consists of a series of proteins that circulate throughout the bloodstream in an inactive but primed state. Based on the activation of different pathways, recognition of immune complexes (classical pathway), mannose residues (lectin pathway), or bacteria and viruses (alternative pathway) results in the activation of a common final effector pathway that forms a membrane attack complex, leading to cell lysis. It can also damage normal tissues if a strong stimulus is received or appropriate inhibitors of complement activation are either not present or have been inactivated. Excessive complement activation often results in the consumption (activation) of C3 complement such that it exceeds the rate at which it is produced by the liver. As a result, C3 levels fall within the bloodstream. Based on this recognition, it is a well-established standard of care that patients who present with evidence of acute glomerulonephritis should have levels of C3 (and C4) complement proteins measured as part of first-line work-up. Traditionally, it is taught that low C3 levels are associated\n\nwith a narrow differential that includes acute post-infectious (post- streptococcal) glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Within this differential, lupus nephritis and an acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) are often easy to distinguish based on clinical history and pattern of complement decrease: lupus nephritis is associated with suppressed levels of both C3 and C4, while PIGN is associated with suppression of only C3 complement. MPGN can resemble PIGN at presentation with only suppressed levels of C3 complement. Whereas PIGN is typically self-limited, MPGN is persistent and often diagnosed when a patient with presumed PIGN has persistently low C3 levels and undergoes a kidney biopsy. Recent studies of complement-mediated disease, however, have led to the realization that the differential discussed above (PIGN vs lupus nephritis vs MPGN) is in fact too narrow and that MPGN encompasses a much broader spectrum of disease. Indeed, the descriptive histological term, MPGN has largely been replaced by the use of the terms C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, inherited and acquired complement deficiencies are seen in many forms of thrombotic microangiopathy (ie, “atypical” hemolytic uremic syndrome). As such, expanded testing of multiple complement proteins beyond C3 and C4, including Factor B (and its autoantibody), Factor H (and its autoantibody), Factor I, C3/C4 nephritic factors, and levels of the soluble membrane attack complex (C5b-9) should be considered in appropriate clinical scenarios. In the clinical vignette above, the patient has a classic presentation of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). She had a suspected case of streptococcal pharyngitis approximately 2 weeks prior to developing gross hematuria. She has features of an acute nephritic syndrome with hematuria, proteinuria, mild hypertension (the 95th percentile blood pressure for a 5 year girl is approximately 110/70 mm Hg), edema, and mild serum creatinine elevation. Given her classic presentation, this child should initially be managed with observation, as PSGN is the most likely diagnosis and is a self- limited condition in the vast majority of cases. The glomerular inflammation\n\nand complement activation will typically resolve over the course of weeks to at most 3 months as the levels of the anti-streptococcal antibodies naturally decrease. She should be counseled to follow a low sodium diet to minimize the risk of worsening hypertension. The C3 level should be repeated in 8 to 12 weeks, and normalization is expected in PSGN. Should her condition not follow the anticipated pattern, a kidney biopsy could be appropriate. Given its self-limited nature, corticosteroids are typically not used for acute PSGN and would not be the appropriate next step in management. Complement Factor H levels should be measured in patients with evidence of C3 glomerulopathy or thrombotic microangiography, which does not fit her clinical picture. PREP Pearls Complement levels should be routinely measured in patients who have acute glomerulonephritis. Low C3 complement glomerulonephritis can be seen in patients with acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, and MPGN (now subdivided into C3 glomerulopathy and immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis).

    "explanation": "X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) occurs as a result of the loss of function mutation in the PHEX gene, occurring in 1:20,000 births, and it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. PHEX is mostly localized to the bone and teeth. This condition is the most common inherited form of rickets and is associated with hypophosphatemia, normocalcemia, low or normal 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels, and increased serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels. Phosphorus is important in skeletal development and bone mineralization. Fibroblast growth factor 23, synthesized by osteoblasts and osteocytes, is a phosphaturic factor and requires a co-receptor α-Klotho. Fibroblast growth factor 23 decreases the expression of sodium-phosphate cotransporters (NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc) on the apical surface of proximal tubule, reduces the level of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D by suppression of 1-alpha hydroxylase activity and activation of 24-hydroxylase. Clinical symptoms of XLH can occur during the first year of life with craniotabes, delayed tooth eruption, and delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle. Skeletal problems include genu varum or genu valgum, bone pain, fractures, growth impairment, widening of the wrist, frontal bossing, dental abscesses, chest deformities, and muscle weakness. Other symptoms include myocardial dysfunction and altered mental status (Chiari malformation). In adult patients, mineralization of tendons and ligaments, arthritis, and osteophytes have been reported.\n\nSkeletal imaging of the knees and wrists will show metaphyseal flaring and cupping as well as lateral widening with expansion of the growth plate. The therapeutic goal is to improve skeletal abnormalities, increase growth, and decrease bone pain. Conventional therapy includes phosphate supplementation and an activated vitamin D analog, such as calcitriol. Even at high doses, phosphorus supplementation does not fully correct the skeletal abnormalities. Hypercalciuria is a complication of calcitriol, which can lead to nephrocalcinosis. Although the mechanism is unclear, secondary hyperparathyroidism can occur with hypercalcemia. Cinacalcet hydrochloride has been used to lower both parathyroid hormone levels and manage hypercalcemia. Parathyroidectomy may be required for persistent hypercalcemia unresponsive to medical management. Burosumab, a fully humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets FGF23, was approved in 2018 for the treatment of pediatric (older than 1 year of age) and adult patients with XLH. Treatment with burosumab increased serum phosphorus and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels, improved rickets severity scores on imaging, and increased linear growth with improvement in mobility compared to conventional therapy. Adverse events with burosumab therapy include injection site reaction and nasopharyngitis, with higher number of subjects with dental abscess. Surgery for severe bowing or tibial torsion are recommended if there is minimal improvement with medical management. In the vignette, burosumab is the best therapy. Increasing phosphate supplement will improve serum phosphate, but it will not correct the skeletal abnormalities. A higher dose of calcitriol will worsen hypercalciuria. Growth hormone has been utilized in XLH to enhance linear growth. There was a reported improvement in height standard deviation scores after 2 years of growth hormone therapy in children with XLH; however, another study reported no difference in adult height between growth hormone and no growth hormone treatment during childhood. As with phosphate\n\nsupplementation, growth hormone has not been shown to improve skeletal abnormalities. Cinacalcet hydrochloride has been used for treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia in XLH without any effects on the skeletal abnormalities. Currently, there are no guidelines regarding the initial therapy for XLH, but the recommendation based on most recent studies is to start burosumab to correct the skeletal abnormalities associated with this condition. Recently, sclerostin, a protein produced by osteocytes that suppresses bone formation by antagonizing Wnt signaling, is reported to be elevated in XLH. In a recent animal study, antibodies to sclerostin improved bone mass and increased phosphate levels in growing HYP mice. Although sclerostin antibody therapy is currently available for adult osteoporosis, this will require further clinical study in XLH. PREP Pearls X-linked hypophosphatemia is a common cause of inherited rickets with hypophosphatemia and elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 levels. Burosumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody to fibroblast growth factor 23, is effective in X-linked hypophosphatemia. Surgery may be needed in cases of severe genu varum or when genu valgum or tibial torsion is unresponsive to medical management.

    "explanation": "In 1881, Dr Guido Fanconi described abnormalities of the defective proximal renal tubule with proteinuria, glycosuria, and phosphaturia. Renal Fanconi syndrome is characterized by proximal tubule dysfunction, which can be either congenital or acquired (Table), or temporary or permanent.\n\nThe majority of the filtrate is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule by transporters for sodium, water, amino acid, organic acid, glucose, phosphorus, and bicarbonate. In addition, low-molecular-weight proteins can be reclaimed via endocytic processing by binding to megalin and cubilin. The proximal tubule is packed with mitochondria and is vulnerable to insults because of a lack of enzymes to generate adenosine triphosphate via anaerobic glycolysis. Proximal tubule cells use fatty acid oxidation for energy and not glucose. The clinical manifestations of Fanconi syndrome include generalized aminoaciduria, glucosuria, phosphaturia, metabolic acidosis, kaliuresis, natriuresis, polyuria, polydipsia, growth impairment, and low-molecular- weight proteinuria (retinol binding protein and β2-microglobulin). Glycosuria occurs in the absence of hyperglycemia. Hypophosphatemia can lead to bone demineralization and rickets. The renal threshold for bicarbonate is decreased and bicarbonate reabsorption is impaired in the proximal tubule so bicarbonate reabsorption is achieved by alpha-intercalated cells in the distal tubule. Management should be directed to the primary etiology of Fanconi syndrome if possible. Correction of multiple electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities is also required. Fanconi syndrome requires large doses of base supplement, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, magnesium, and phosphate. Aminoaciduria, glucosuria, proteinuria, and hyperuricosuria do not require specific treatment. Carnitine supplementation for urinary losses may improve muscle and lipid profiles. Vitamin D supplementation and correction of hypophosphatemia are needed for bone disease. The child in the vignette has high requirements to replace urinary losses of phosphate, potassium, magnesium, and bicarbonate. Many of the medications (eg, sodium citrate, potassium chloride) used to correct these abnormalities can aggravate emesis and worsen diarrhea. In this case, starting total parenteral nutrition is the best option to correct fluid and electrolyte requirements, augment much needed calories, and give bowel\n\nrest. Restarting intravenous fluids and medications may correct electrolyte abnormalities but will not meet caloric requirements. Slow advancement of gastrostomy tube feeding and low-dose medications can be started once the patient has recovered from the protracted course of gastrointestinal illness. PREP Pearls Fanconi syndrome includes defective proximal renal tubule function leading to electrolyte abnormalities with proteinuria, glycosuria, phosphaturia.

    "explanation": "than 12 years In adults and children with chronic kidney disease (CKD), dyslipidemia is common and independently associated with lower glomerular filtration rates (GFR). The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines identify children and adolescents with abnormal total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride levels. These guidelines identified lipoprotein concentrations greater than the 75th and 95th percentiles (25th and 5th for HDL-C) as borderline-abnormal and abnormal for all children aged between 2 to 19 years. Limitations of these guidelines include: a) lipoprotein concentrations change considerably with normal growth and maturation and vary by gender, which is not reflected by these cutpoints, b) the percentile cutoff is arbitrarily chosen, has no clinical or health-related meaning, and does not predict children more likely to have abnormal lipid profile as adults, and c) the NCEP guidelines are based on the population distribution of the late 1980s, and the distribution of these lipoproteins, particularly triglycerides, has changed over time. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) has been used to develop age- and gender-specific thresholds; however, this classification system is limited to children aged 12 to 20 years. This limitation was present as fasting samples for lipid profile were not considered suitable for young children and not collected for children younger than 12 years in the NHANES surveys.\n\nIn the publications from the Chronic Kidney Disease in children (CKiD) study, dyslipidemia is defined as: triglyceride levels greater than 130 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels less than 40 mg/dL, and non-HDL-C levels greater than 160 mg/dL. These cut-points were based upon: 1) NHANES data for children aged 12 to 20 years, 2) data of the Lipid Research Clinic data set, and 3) levels frequently considered atherogenic in adults. Data from the multicenter CKiD study (n = 391) showed that dyslipidemia (one or more abnormal lipid measure) was common and prevalent in 45% of 2 the children with moderate renal failure (GFR 30 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m ), and 45% of these had combined dyslipidemia. A more recent analysis from the same cohort (n = 508) of patients with 2 to 6 lipid measurements, dyslipidemia was common and present at baseline in 35% and 43% of children with nonglomerular and glomerular CKD, respectively. The study also reported persistent dyslipidemia as the patients aged (median follow-up of 4 years). Similar to adult patients with CKD, “atherogenic dyslipidemia” with high prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia, increased non-HDL-C, reduced HDL- C, and combined dyslipidemias, was identified in children with CKD. In the absence of comorbidities frequently seen in adults with CKD (diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, obesity, vascular disease); dyslipidemia in children with renal failure underscores the risks of premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and accelerated CKD progression. Similar to adult data, it has been reported that dyslipidemia worsens in proportion to declining GFR, worsening proteinuria, and increasing body mass index. Familial hypercholesterolemia should be suspected in patients with an abnormal lipid profile, positive family history, and physical examination positive for abnormal deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas) and eyes (xanthelasmas). A family history of premature cardiovascular disease is generally defined as heart attack, treated angina, interventions for coronary artery disease, sudden cardiac death, or ischemic stroke in a male parent or sibling before 55 years of age or a female parent or sibling before 65 years of age. A fasting lipid profile positive for elevated total cholesterol and LDL-C, with normal or low HDL-C are the usual features in patients with familial\n\nhypercholesterolemia. Triglycerides are normal, unless the patient has other potential causes such as obesity. The patient in the vignette has borderline elevated non-HDL-C (120-144 mg/dL), elevated triglyceride levels and normal HDL-C levels secondary to chronic kidney disease. PREP Pearls Based on limited data and levels considered atherogenic in adults, dyslipidemia in children with chronic kidney disease could be defined as: triglycerides greater than 130 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 40 mg/dL, and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than 160 mg/dL. In children with chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia worsens in proportion to declining glomerular filtration rate, worsening proteinuria, Close and increasing body mass index.

    "explanation": "month\n\nThe patient in this vignette is seen for evaluation of microscopic hematuria; however, routine laboratory studies show an elevated serum creatinine level, which should prompt an investigation into his overall kidney function. The kidney has a diverse set of physiologic functions within the body, including clearing waste products, regulating overall water balance, regulating electrolytes, assisting the maintenance of a normal acid-base status, maintaining red blood cell counts, and activating vitamin D. As such, measurement of overall kidney function can include blood tests to assess these various factors. However, overall kidney function is typically monitored by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which correlates with all of the other aspects of kidney function. It is difficult to measure GFR directly. In an experimental setting, a tracer such as inulin or iothalamate can be injected into a subject and the clearance of the tracer monitored via serial blood and urine collections. This method of GFR testing is not practical in routine clinical settings. Instead, it is possible to follow the levels of endogenous markers. The ideal endogenous marker, which does not exist, would be produced within the body at a constant rate, and its elimination from the body would only be dependent upon glomerular filtration. In this scenario, levels of the endogenous marker can be followed, and equations can be developed that can generate estimated GFRs. Serum creatinine is the most-widespread endogenous marker that is used to monitor GFR. However, creatinine is dependent upon muscle mass and changes throughout life as a child grows and increases their muscle mass. The clearance of creatinine is not solely dependent upon glomerular filtration, which also limits its ability to be an ideal marker of GFR. Creatinine can be cleared by secretion from kidney tubular cells and degradation within the gastrointestinal tract. As an alternative to the limitations with creatinine, serum cystatin C can be used as an endogenous marker of GFR. Cystatin C is a 13-kDa protein that is released from all nucleated cells in the body and is almost exclusively cleared\n\nby glomerular filtration. However, cystatin C has limitations to its use. It is more expensive than creatinine, it is not available in all laboratories, it can be affected by the concurrent use of corticosteroids, and a reference standard for cystatin C was only first introduced in 2010. Cystatin C levels are higher in infants compared to children and adults. As a result, GFR-estimating equations have not been developed for infant cystatin C levels. Even for older children and adults, multiple different cystatin C equations have been proposed. Despite these limitations, cystatin C is useful as a GFR marker in patients who have either increased or decreased muscle mass and/or are taking dietary supplements that can alter creatinine levels (eg, creatine). It has also been shown to correlate with progression of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The patient in the vignette is taking creatine supplements and has evidence of increased muscle mass due to weightlifting. As such, the correct answer for evaluation of his increased serum creatinine is to measure a cystatin C level. Given his increased serum creatinine level, simple observation would not be appropriate (although it would be appropriate for his microscopic hematuria). The use of timed urine collections are limited by the tubular secretion of creatinine and the difficulties associated with fully collecting urine over a 24- hour period. They are also affected by the increased muscle mass, as seen in this patient’s case. While stopping the creatine supplement may cause a decrease in the serum creatinine level, studies indicate that use of this dietary supplement is not associated with adverse kidney function. PREP Pearls Cystatin C can be used to estimate glomerular filtration rate in patients with increased or decreased muscle mass. Cystatin C has multiple limitations including cost, assay variability, and multiple glomerular filtration rate–estimating equations. Cystatin C levels are higher in infants than children and adults.\n\nABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area Understand the different stages in the development of the urinary tract Suggested Readings Benoit SW, CIccia EA, and Devarajan P.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrates multiple foci of T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity symmetrically distributed in the cortex of the posterior parieto-occipital regions and cerebellar hemispheres, most consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The additional clinical findings of microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, acute kidney injury (AKI), and hyperkalemia suggest acute glomerulonephritis as the cause of hypertension. Given the low serum C3 level with normal serum C4, the most likely diagnosis is acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN). PIGN is one of the most common causes of acute glomerulonephritis in children. It typically occurs after infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection, either due to pharyngitis or pyoderma. PIGN can also be triggered by other bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. The median age of presentation of PIGN is 6 to 8 years, and there is a higher prevalence among males. The clinical course of PIGN is characterized by latent, acute, and recovery phases. The latent phase between GAS infection and onset of PIGN can range from 3 to 33 days but most commonly occurs 1 to 3 weeks after pharyngitis or 3 to 6 weeks after pyoderma. A preceding pharyngitis or rash is commonly identified, however PIGN may occur without identified antecedent symptoms. The clinical presentation during the acute phase of PIGN is highly variable, ranging from mild cases of isolated microscopic hematuria to severe cases with rapidly progressive renal failure. The most common findings in children\n\ninclude edema, gross hematuria, and hypertension, mainly as a result of excessive sodium and water retention that leads to extracellular volume expansion. Proteinuria is common, but nephrotic syndrome has only been reported in 2% to 20% of cases. Patients can have varying degrees of AKI. Dialysis is rarely required but may be acutely needed in patients with a rapidly progressive course. Laboratory findings may include hematuria, proteinuria, hyperkalemia, elevated serum creatinine levels, and low hemoglobin and serum albumin levels. Microscopic examination of the urine typically reveals dysmorphic red blood cells and red blood casts. Serologic markers of prior streptococcal exposure such as antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer have high sensitivity but low specificity. ASO typically starts to rise 1 week after GAS infection and peaks at 3 to 5 weeks. ASO titer results can be falsely low or negative in patients with PIGN after pyoderma. Reduction in C3 is a more specific marker of PIGN and typically starts to decline in the latent phase prior to onset of clinical features. PIGN can also have atypical presentations. Similar to the case in this vignette, patients may present with severe hypertension without gross hematuria or even with minimal urinary abnormalities. Severe hypertension may lead to headaches, seizures, and hypertensive encephalopathy. The mechanism of PRES in PIGN is not fully understood but may be a result of vasogenic edema due to hypertension as well as direct inflammatory effects on the cerebral blood–brain barrier, leading to increased vascular permeability. Patients with PIGN may have shortness of breath or chest pain as a result of pulmonary edema; rarely, they may have a rash that resembles Henoch-Schönlein purpura. A renal biopsy is not usually required in patients with PIGN. However, it may be indicated in patients with severe acute kidney injury or atypical presentations. The classic findings on light microscopy include diffuse hypercellularity of endothelial and mesangial cells with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The tubulointerstitium and vasculature are typically normal. Epithelial crescents can be seen in cases of severe PIGN with a rapidly\n\nprogressive course. Immunofluorescence is characterized by granular deposition of IgG and C3 in the mesangium and capillary loops. Electron microscopy classically shows subepithelial immune complex deposits (“humps”), corresponding to deposits of IgG and C3. PIGN typically resolves spontaneously without treatment. Management is supportive and includes treatment of hypertension with salt and fluid restriction, diuretics, and vasodilators. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be avoided in the acute setting due to risk of worsening AKI and hyperkalemia. Patients with severe hypertension may require continuous infusion of anti-hypertensive medication to safely lower the blood pressure. The majority of patients with PIGN experience a full clinical recovery. Hypertension typically resolves within a few weeks of presentation. Gross hematuria and proteinuria typically resolve within a few weeks, although microscopic hematuria may persist for months to years. Alternative diagnoses should be considered if hypertension, gross hematuria, or proteinuria persist for a prolonged time period. C3 levels typically normalize 6 to 8 weeks after initial presentation. Lack of C3 recovery, especially in the context of ongoing clinical symptoms, should prompt consideration of other causes of glomerulonephritis. The majority of patients with PIGN have an excellent long-term prognosis. However, long-term follow-up studies have shown that some patients develop hypertension, proteinuria, and chronic kidney disease later in life. Mesangial hypercellularity and expansion with mesangial IgA deposition is characteristic of IgA nephropathy, and thin glomerular basement membranes with absent staining for α-5 chain of type IV collagen is characteristic of Alport syndrome. Both of these diseases cause glomerulonephritis, but serum complement is usually normal. Diffusely thickened glomerular basement without significant hypercellularity is characteristic of membranous nephropathy, which more commonly presents with nephrotic syndrome and without suppression of C3. PREP Pearls\n\nPostinfectious glomerulonephritis classically presents with gross hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, and acute kidney injury with low serum C3 level, preceded by an upper respiratory infection or skin rash. Atypical presentations may occur, including severe hypertension that leads to neurologic complications. Histologic manifestations of postinfectious glomerulonephritis include diffuse endocapillary proliferation with neutrophilic infiltrate, granular deposition of IgG and C3 on immunofluorescence, and subepithelial immune complex deposition (“humps”) on electron microscopy.

    "explanation": "The patient in this vignette has presumed viral gastroenteritis. She has mild to moderate dehydration (7.3% weight loss from prior illness, tachycardia, irritability, sunken eyes, tacky mucous membranes, and decreased skin turgor) and low serum sodium concentration and serum osmolality. Based on these findings, she has hypo-osmolar hypovolemic hyponatremia. This presentation is not uncommon in young children with gastroenteritis. However, the severity of her acute dehydration after only 24 hours of symptoms, her prior recurrent hospital admissions for intravenous rehydration, and her poor growth cause concern for an underlying disease process affecting urinary concentration capacity. Furthermore, her hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and glycosuria despite a normal serum glucose level suggest possible proximal tubular dysfunction such as renal Fanconi syndrome. To determine whether her hyponatremia is solely related to volume losses from the gastrointestinal tract versus concurrent volume loss from inappropriate renal solute handling, her urine sodium level should be assessed. Hyponatremia, a serum sodium concentration of less than 135 mEq/L (135 mmol/L), reflects a state of increased total body water content relative to total body sodium. Sodium is the major cation in extracellular fluid and the main osmotically active substance in blood plasma; true hyponatremia is associated with hypo-osmolality (serum osmolality <280 mOsm/kg). Thus, the first step in evaluating hyponatremia is to rule out the possibility of pseudohyponatremia (if serum osmolality is normal, 280 to 295 mOsm/kg) or dilutional hyponatremia (if serum osmolality is elevated, >295 mOsm/kg). Causes of iso-osmolar hyponatremia include hypertriglyceridemia and paraproteinemia, which both increase the lipid/protein component in plasma (normally about 7% of plasma volume). Causes of hyperosmolar hyponatremia include hyperglycemia and the use of hypertonic infusions,\n\nsuch as mannitol. These causes produce a dilutional hyponatremia by promoting movement of water from the intracellular space into the extracellular fluid compartment. If hypo-osmolar hyponatremia is present, the next step is to assess the patient’s volume status by clinical examination. In the case of hypovolemic hyponatremia, there is low plasma volume that may be related to increased renal losses or extrarenal losses (eg, gastrointestinal tract, skin, lungs). Euvolemic hyponatremia, such as seen with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), occurs when there is impaired free water excretion but normal or only slightly increased extracellular fluid volume. The patient does not become edematous because urine sodium excretion is intact. Urine osmolality is elevated (>100 mOsm/kg) in SIADH, reflective of the inability to excrete free water in the setting of low serum osmolality. This condition differs from psychogenic polydipsia, in which the kidneys’ ability to eliminate free water produces a dilute urine (urine osmolality <100 mOsm/kg) in the setting of a water load. In hypervolemic hyponatremia, such as in heart failure or nephrotic syndrome, there is both increased sodium and water retention as a result of decreased effective circulating volume. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is also seen in chronic kidney disease due to impaired water excretion and the inability to enhance urine sodium excretion in the face of an ingested solute load. In response to intravascular volume depletion, several mechanisms are activated to restore plasma volume. Low arterial blood pressure, sensed by baroreceptors in the carotid sinus, provides central feedback to the hypothalamus to increase ADH release from the posterior pituitary for enhancing water reabsorption along the cortical collecting duct. Antidiuretic hormone is also secreted when hypothalamic osmoreceptors sense increased plasma osmolality, but the response to low plasma volume may override this function even if plasma osmolality is normal. A fall in blood pressure and reduction in renal perfusion upregulate renin production by juxtaglomerular apparatus and downstream activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to enhance sodium and water reabsorption. Thus, both plasma renin\n\nactivity and plasma aldosterone are expected to be elevated in this patient, but they cannot be used to distinguish between renal or extrarenal losses. The exception is classic salt wasting from congenital adrenal hyperplasia, in which plasma aldosterone levels are low, but there would be accompanying hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia as in this case. In a patient with hypovolemic hyponatremia and normal kidneys, there should be increased reabsorption of sodium to restore plasma volume (urine sodium <20 mEq/L is common). However, an elevated urine sodium level (>40 mEq/L) in the setting of acute volume loss is suggestive of inappropriate solute handling, whether it be congenital (eg, renal tubular acidosis, salt- losing tubulopathies) or acquired (eg, diuretics). Thus, further assessment of renal tubular dysfunction is warranted, as in this case. Urine calcium levels may be elevated in several renal tubulopathies, but it would not be the most appropriate test to order prior to confirming whether or not there is additional volume loss from the kidneys. PREP Pearls The evaluation of hyponatremia requires assessment of plasma osmolality to exclude pseudohyponatremia and dilutional hyponatremia as well as a clinical examination to determine the patient’s volume status. Elevated urine sodium in a child with hypovolemic hyponatremia should raise suspicion for underlying renal tubular dysfunction, whether it be congenital (eg, renal tubular acidosis, salt-losing tubulopathies) or acquired (eg, diuretics).

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), also called IgA vasculitis. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is the most common vasculitis in children and presents with purpuric/petechial rash (without thrombocytopenia) and additionally at least one of the symptoms of arthritis, nephritis, and/or gastrointestinal involvement. It is slightly more common in males than females. Most patients are seen at 10 years of age or younger, though it rarely can first be seen in teenagers or young adults. The presenting symptoms can be quite striking and uncommonly include serious complications, such as intussusception. With the exception of renal involvement, it is otherwise a self-limited condition with excellent long-term outcomes. About half of patients with HSP have renal involvement, and it may include mild presentations, such as isolated microscopic hematuria, or more significant and severe clinical manifestations, such as nephrotic syndrome, severe hypertension, and acute kidney injury. Most renal involvement will present within 2 months of diagnosis and nearly all within 6 months of presentation. Fortunately, the large majority of patients have only mild renal involvement and demonstrate a self-limited and spontaneously resolving clinical course with excellent renal functional outcomes with supportive treatment alone. On the other hand, those patients who have nephrotic- range proteinuria and/or acute kidney injury may have a worse prognosis and develop long-term sequelae of chronic kidney disease, such as persistent proteinuria, hypertension, and less commonly but most significantly, end- stage renal disease. Most cases of HSP nephritis are self-limited and do not\n\nrequire treatment; however, those patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria and/or acute kidney injury do appear to respond well to corticosteroids, though this has not been established yet in a randomized controlled trial. The patient in the vignette has renal involvement, though at present has only microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria. Supportive care and monitoring is essential, as his nephritis may worsen and require further evaluation and treatment. However, at this time, with mild proteinuria and no sign of acute kidney injury or nephrotic syndrome, treatment with corticosteroids or evaluation with renal biopsy would not be indicated. If he demonstrates persistent hypertension or subnephrotic-range proteinuria, management with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may be a reasonable decision; however, it would not be definitively needed at this time with one- time mild elevation of blood pressure and only mild proteinuria.

    "explanation": "Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), a variant of renal dysplasia, is one of the most frequently encountered congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) in children. MCDK is characterized by disorganized renal tissue structure, with primitive ducts and undifferentiated epithelium, surrounded by fibromuscular connective tissue; seen on ultrasound as several noncommunicating cysts of several sizes separated by dysplastic parenchyma. MCDK, usually diagnosed on antenatal ultrasound, is often unilateral, in which case the contralateral kidney maintains renal function.\n\nBilateral MCDK leads to in-utero end-stage renal disease. MCDK can be an isolated abnormality, associated with other genitourinary anomalies, or an abnormality in multisystem genetic disorders. Multicystic dysplastic kidneys tend to completely involute over time in 19% to 74% cases, with a faster rate of evolution early on in life. The size of the MCDK inversely correlates with complete involution (one study suggested that complete involution is seen when the initial length of the dysplastic kidney is ≤62 mm); however, the mechanism involved for involution is not clear. Large MCDK may take over a decade to involute, and in some patients small remnants remain. The contralateral kidney usually shows evidence of compensatory hypertrophy (ie, a kidney length at least 2 standard deviations above the mean), to balance the loss of functioning renal tissue in the MCDK; more commonly (up to approximately 92% cases) seen when there is complete involution of MCDK, and less commonly in cases with partial or no involution. The absence of compensatory hypertrophy may indicate hypoplasia in the contralateral kidney or another pathological condition. Renal function remains near normal in most patients especially with simple MCDK, ie, unilateral MCDK with a functioning contralateral kidney and no other urinary tract anomalies (such as the patient in the vignette). However, up to 50% of patients who have MCDK that is thought to be complex (ie, patients with unilateral MCDK with structural abnormalities or outflow obstruction in contralateral kidney or those with bilateral MCDK) may develop some degree of renal insufficiency over time. MCDK may be associated with hypertension, usually seen later on in life, secondary to hyperfiltration and/or elevated plasma renin activity, and used to be treated by nephrectomy of MCDK in the past. However, larger studies actually have not shown an increased hypertension risk in patients with MCDK compared with the general population. There is also minimal risk of\n\nmalignant transformation of MCDK to a Wilms tumor or renal cell carcinoma. Routine nephrectomy is not indicated because of the low hypertension risk as well as low risk of malignant transformation. Patients with MCDK should be monitored with serial ultrasonography for involution of the dysplastic kidney as well as the interval growth of the contralateral kidney. They should also be monitored with routine blood pressure and serum creatinine levels to confirm normal renal function, at the first visit and then at 2- and 5-year follow-up visits to diagnose renal insufficiency. When prenatal ultrasound is suspicious for MCDK, a postnatal renal ultrasound is recommended for confirmation of diagnosis and screening for other associated urinary tract abnormalities. Whether routine screening VCUG after birth is necessary in patients with MCDK is debated. Recent recommendations call for VCUG only in MCDK patients with an abnormal ultrasound that demonstrates dilatation of the renal pelvic diameter in the contralateral kidney, or in those who develop a urinary tract infection. It is to be remembered that postnatal ultrasounds obtained within a couple of days after birth have a high rate of false negative results for renal pelvic dilatation because of the presence of relative oliguria soon after birth; hence, a follow-up renal ultrasound is recommended again in 4 to 6 weeks to confirm the findings. Afterward, it is reasonable to have an ultrasound at 2, 5, and 10 years of age. Even though there is no dilatation of renal pelvis in the contralateral kidney in the patient in the vignette, the ultrasound was obtained 24 hours after birth and will need to be repeated, hence vesicoureteric reflux cannot be ruled out definitively at this stage. When the renal pelvis can be identified in a suspected MCDK, a lasix renogram is recommended to rule out an obstructed hydronephrotic kidney. PREP Pearls Unilateral simple multicystic dysplastic kidney tends to involute at a faster rate early on in life and unlikely after 18 months of age. Compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney is usually seen and is more likely with complete involution of multicystic dysplastic kidney.\n\nMulticystic dysplastic kidney may be associated with urinary abnormalities such as vesicoureteric reflux in the contralateral kidney, and voiding cystourethrography is indicated only when an ultrasound more than 48 hours after birth shows pelvic diameter dilation or there is a urinary tract infection.

Iliac horns are present in 70% to 80% of NPS cases. Other skeletal findings include nail dysplasia (100% of patients), elbow anomalies, and patellar agenesis/hypoplasia. Nail hypoplasia tends to affect the thumb more severely than other digits, and the presence of a triangular instead of crescent-shaped lunula (the transparent portion of the nail) is another pathognomonic sign of NPS. More than half of\n\nNPS patients also have hearing loss. Renal findings consist of proteinuria and, less often, hematuria. A renal biopsy, if performed, shows the characteristic electron microscopy findings of distorted glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and cross-banded fibrils in the lamina densa. A renal biopsy is not required for the diagnosis because genetic testing is available in several laboratories around the world and because the severity of histologic abnormalities do not correlate well with disease progression. Nail-patella syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with full penetrance but variable expressivity even among the same family members. The patient in the vignette was adopted, and therefore a positive family history could not be elicited. The mutant gene, LMX1B, is located on chromosome 9, encodes a LIM-domain homeobox transcription factor, and is expressed constitutively in podocytes throughout development. LMX1B-target genes include structural genes in the GBM (eg, COL4A3/A4) and podocytes (eg, NPHS2 and CD2AP). Most mutations cluster in the C-terminus domain and cause the full NPS phenotype. In contrast, mutations involving the amino acid, R246, in LMX1B may be associated with focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis without skeletal involvement.

The filtration barrier in the glomerulus is highly complex, charged, and size specific, and is composed of 3 layers: fenestrated endothelium, glomerular basement membrane, and podocytes with their foot processes and slit diaphragms. Podocytes are highly differentiated cells that have a limited ability to regenerate. Nephrin is a major component of the slit diaphragm and was its first described component. Podocin is a scaffolding protein involved not only in the structure of the slit diaphragm but also in signal transduction from the slit diaphragm to the podocyte as shown in the Figure.\n\nChildren with nephrin mutations account for approximately 40% to 80% of all patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS). Although the incidence of CNS from nephrin is highest in the Finnish population, these mutations have been described in other ethnic populations. This disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, the Finnish mutations (Finn major and Finn minor) result in a stop codon, and the truncated protein is not expressed in the slit diaphragm. More than 200 mutations spanning the entire gene have been described in the non-Finnish population and include deletions, insertions, nonsense, and missense mutations. Milder phenotype has been described with some of the non-Finnish mutations. Extra-renal malformations are not consistently seen in these patients. Approximately 80% of Finnish patients with CNS are born preterm (younger than 38 weeks) and seen with edema in the first 2 weeks after birth. The placenta is larger, and the weight of the placenta is more than 25% of the body weight of the patient. Almost all of the children with CNS will present within the first 2 months of life. Podocin mutations are seen in 17% to 39% of CNS cases. Children with podocin mutations account for up to 28% of sporadic and 40% of familial causes of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. This disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Podocin belongs to a lipid raft–associated stomatin family of proteins. Podocin acts as a scaffolding protein, is localized to the intercellular area of the podocyte, and plays a critical role in the recruitment of nephrin to the slit diaphragm. Patients with podocin mutation have a variable disease phenotype compared to patients with nephrin mutations with respect to onset of proteinuria, severity of disease, and progression to end-stage renal disease. Wilms tumor suppressor gene (WT1) encodes for WT1 protein, a zinc finger transcription factor that is important in urogenital development. Mutation in the WT1 gene causes genital anomalies, tumors in the kidney and glomerular diseases like Frasier and Denys-Drash syndromes. WT1 was first identified in children with WAGR syndrome, which is characterized by Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation. The WT1 gene has 10 exons, and alternative splicing results in many isoforms that have different\n\nfunctions. One alternative splice site is in exon 9, which results in either inclusion or exclusion of 3 amino acids: lysine, threonine, and serine (KTS). The KTS+ isoforms constitute approximately 80% of the transcripts. Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) is an association of early-onset nephrotic syndrome that progresses quickly to end-stage renal disease, Wilms tumors, and male pseudohermaphroditism. Incomplete association of this syndrome has also been reported. Patients with XY karyotype either have female or ambiguous external genitalia with “streak” gonads or ambiguous internal genitalia. Patients with XX genotype have normal external and internal genitalia. Diffuse mesangial sclerosis is the characteristic histopathological glomerular finding. More than 80 heterozygous germline mutations in WT1 have been reported in DDS, and most of them are missense mutations within exon 8 and 9, which encodes for zinc fingers 2 and 3. These mutations appear to have a dominant negative effect, and nuclear expression of WT1 is reduced in podocytes, which ultimately affects their function. Frasier syndrome is an association of male pseudohermaphroditism and progressive nephropathy. Frasier syndrome patients with an XY karyotype have normal female genitalia with sex reversal and gonadal dysgenesis. Proteinuria is diagnosed in childhood, and progression to end-stage renal disease is slow and occurs in the second or third decade of life. Renal biopsy shows focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or occasionally minimal change. Gonadoblastoma is associated with Frasier syndrome. Heterozygous splice mutations in intron 9 are constant in Frasier syndrome but can be seen in patients with isolated diffuse mesangial sclerosis and DDS. These mutations are predicted to decrease the +KTS/-KTS isoform ratio. Patients with DDS and Frasier syndrome are not responsive to immunosuppressive medications, and they should undergo kidney transplantation. Recurrence after transplantation has not been described. Pierson syndrome is caused by loss of function in the LAMB2 gene, which encodes for laminin β2. Pierson syndrome is an association of early-onset nephrotic syndrome that progresses quickly to end-stage renal disease, microcoria, and neurologic abnormalities. Laminin β2 is expressed in the\n\nglomerular basement membrane, and a lack of laminin β2 results in disruption of the function of the glomerular basement membrane. In addition, laminin β2 is expressed in the eye and neurosynaptic junctions. Diffuse mesangial sclerosis is seen in the majority of patients while some show focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on renal biopsy. The patient in this vignette has an XY karyotype, ambiguous genitalia, streak gonads, early-onset nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure. This constellation of findings is in keeping with a WT1 mutation. PREP Pearls Genes that are commonly involved in nephrotic syndrome presenting within the first year of life include nephrin (NPHS1), podocin (NPHS2), Wilms tumor suppression gene 1 (WT1), phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1 or NPHS3), and laminin β2 (LAMB2). Denys-Drash and Fraiser syndrome are due to mutations in the WT1 gene. Patients with Denys-Drash syndrome typically develop end-stage renal disease within the first year of life, which is associated with a mutation in exon 8 and 9 of the WT1 gene, while Frasier syndrome presents with later-onset nephrotic syndrome and progression to end- stage renal disease. The mutation is typically in intron 9. ABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area Know the pathophysiology of infantile nephrotic syndrome Suggested Readings Gbadegesin R, Lavin P, Foreman J, Winn M.

    "explanation": "The child in the vignette has hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Hemolytic uremic syndrome consists of a destructive thrombocytopenia secondary to activated platelet aggregation, leading to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and acute kidney injury, the latter related to microangiopathic injury to the glomerular endothelium. The most common cause of HUS is related to Shiga- like toxin–producing strains of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infections, such as the E coli O157:H7 strain. Less frequently, HUS may be secondary to invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, or related to hereditary or acquired dysfunction of the alternative pathway of the complement system. Atypical HUS is related to dysregulation of the complement system. More specifically, mutation or loss of function of regulators of the complement system activity, such as complement factor H or factor I, which when not sufficiently functional, leads to overactivation and unhalting activation of the alternative pathway and complement membrane attack complex. All forms of HUS can be associated with additional organ system involvement including injury to the central nervous system, pancreas, and heart among others, and atypical HUS seems to have a higher incidence of extrarenal system involvement. Initial treatments for atypical HUS were based on plasma infusion and exchange, which worked by removing activated complement factors and delivering functional complement regulators. These treatments were not effective in many patients and were associated with high rates of morbidity, permanent loss of kidney function, and mortality. More recently, monoclonal antibody therapy to complement 5, which when activated leads to activation of the complement membrane attack complex, has been effective for and is extremely well tolerated by most patients with atypical HUS. The main challenges related to these antibody therapies are the potential need for infusions as often as every 2 weeks, the high cost, and an increased risk for life-threatening infections by encapsulated bacteria including Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Therefore, it is essential that vaccinations to prevent these infections precede therapy with complement 5–blocking antibody.\n\nGiven that the girl in the vignette is unimmunized, H influenzae type B vaccine is the best option for her, because it is vital that she be caught up on her H influenzae and S pneumoniae vaccines and receive the vaccine for N meningitidis. Because it takes time for vaccine effect to develop, she will also require oral antibiotic prophylaxis for a window of time. Although platelet transfusions are sometimes needed in the management of atypical HUS, with 3 9 a platelet count of 58 × 10 /μL (58 × 10 /L), this is not the most essential therapy at this time. Although the patient has an influenza infection, oseltamivir is only indicated if started within the first 2 days of illness, which has already passed. There is no indication that the patient’s presenting condition is related to an acute bacterial infection; therefore, ceftriaxone is not the most essential of the options listed. PREP Pearls Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome is related to mutation or loss of function of regulators of the complement system activity, such as complement factor H or factor I, which leads to overactivation and unhalting activation of the alternative pathway and complement membrane attack complex.

    "explanation": "This patient has hypercalcemia likely secondary to subcutaneous fat necrosis, a granulomatous disease seen in term infants, typically after a traumatic delivery. The conversion of 25 (OH)D to 1,25 (OH) D is enhanced in 2 granulomas, resulting in a highly activated vitamin D effect with hypercalcemia and suppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for hypercalcemia in children is presented in the Table . It can be explored by assessing serum PTH, 25 (OH)D, 1,25 (OH) D, 2 electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium (both ionized and total), phosphate, magnesium, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase. A urinalysis with microscopy, urine calcium, phosphate, and creatinine should be performed as well. Further imaging and evaluation, including skeletal imaging and renal ultrasonography, may be considered based on the results. Treatment of hypercalcemia should target mechanisms to enhance calcium excretion in the urine and incorporation of calcium into the bone. Circulating volume expansion with isotonic fluid is the first-line therapy used to increase urinary excretion of calcium. Volume repletion will suppress reabsorption of water and sodium in the proximal convoluted tubule and loop of Henle. With less sodium reabsorption in these segments, calcium reabsorption will also be less, enhancing excretion of calcium in the urine. In addition, because hypercalcemia may also lead to polyuria, volume resuscitation is often needed. Therefore, a recommendation of normal saline would be the most appropriate treatment approach for this patient. Furosemide and other loop diuretics can also be effective at enhancing urinary excretion of calcium. Blocking sodium reabsorption at the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle will decrease paracellular calcium reabsorption with a resulting increase of calcium excretion in the urine. Of note, furosemide should only be administered in the setting of complete volume repletion, because it may risk the development or worsening of nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. In addition, furosemide in a volume- depleted setting would stimulate proximal convoluted tubule sodium reabsorption with resulting increased proximal calcium reabsorption. This would interfere with its ability to enhance urinary calcium excretion. Therefore, normal saline represents the best immediate treatment recommendation; furosemide may be added subsequently if additional treatment is needed once volume repletion is confirmed.\n\nAnother consideration in the immediate management of acute and severe hypercalcemia is calcitonin. Calcitonin inhibits bone resorption of calcium and has a relatively rapid onset of action within hours. Its effects are modest and should not replace the use of circulating volume expansion. It can only be given in the short term because it has many adverse effects, and its positive effects decrease over time. However, bisphosphonates represent an excellent treatment strategy for increasing incorporation of calcium into the bone, as they also inhibit bone resorption. The main drawback in an acute setting is that their effects typically take 1 to 2 days. Therefore, normal saline is the better immediate treatment recommendation. However, if the duration of hypercalcemia is anticipated to be longer (as would be the case in subcutaneous fat necrosis), bisphosphonates may provide a helpful long- term approach. Steroids have also been used for the treatment of hypercalcemia in subcutaneous fat necrosis. Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic that can activate the calcium-sensing receptor and decrease secretion of PTH. This therapy for hypercalcemia is most effective in the setting of elevated PTH. Given that the PTH level of the child in the vignette is suppressed, it would not be an effective treatment approach in this case. PREP Pearls The differential diagnosis for hypercalcemia in children can be explored by assessing serum parathyroid hormone, 25 (OH)D, 1,25 (OH) D, 2 electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium (both ionized and total), and phosphate. One should consider causes related to elevated versus suppressed parathyroid hormone, and/or elevated versus low/normal vitamin D activity. The treatment approach to symptomatic hypercalcemia should target mechanisms that enhance excretion of calcium in the urine and incorporation of calcium in the bone. Circulating volume expansion is the first-line and standard approach to enhancing calcium excretion in the urine and can be supplemented with loop diuretics once volume repletion is confirmed.\n\nCalcitonin can be used to enhance incorporation of calcium into the bone in the acute setting, but for chronic situations, bisphosphonates should be started for a longer term effect and approach.

    "explanation": "The infant in this vignette has significantly elevated blood pressure readings for her postconceptual age. Measurement technique is a significant challenge in assessing blood pressure and diagnosing hypertension in infants, in particular neonates in the intensive care unit. When direct arterial line measurement is not possible or appropriate, a suggested strategy includes using a consistent measurement device; separating measurement 1 to 2 hours after a feeding or medical intervention; ensuring that the infant is lying down; ensuring an appropriately sized cuff on the upper arm with the infant asleep or in a quiet, awake state; and taking 3 successive blood pressure readings at 2-minute intervals. Of note, normal blood pressure values change and increase over the first 2 weeks of life. Therefore, in any neonate under 2 weeks of age, term or preterm, age will need to be factored in for proper diagnosis of blood pressure elevation. Additionally, for neonates who were born prematurely, blood pressure increases with increasing post-conceptual age, therefore, age even beyond 2 weeks remains an important factor in interpreting preterm neonatal blood pressures. Blood pressure elevation is reasonably common in infants with a history of prematurity, especially as they reach 40 weeks post-conceptual age. The pathophysiology remains unclear, and some studies suggest that the severity or chronicity of hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, and/or concomitant medication use may be factors. The high incidence of acute kidney injury in this population, including that not formally recognized or diagnosed, may also be a factor. Fortunately, the natural history of hypertension in these\n\ninfants seems to be transient, and as their lung and renal function matures, they will have normal blood pressure throughout childhood, though they seem to have a higher incidence again as teenagers and young adults. Even though hypertension as a complication of prematurity is being increasingly recognized, there remains a differential diagnosis for blood pressure elevation in a neonate. Once significant and persistent elevations are identified, other etiologies such as structural renal disease (including cystic disease and congenital renal malformations), renovascular disease (eg, history of umbilical arterial lines), and functional renal disease should be considered. Additionally, a thorough medication history should be reviewed as iatrogenic cause is a common etiology. Less common etiologies may include neuroendocrine or metabolic disorders and should be considered but do not require evaluation in all infants. For the infant in the vignette, renal functional etiologies have been considered and excluded, as her serum creatinine level and urine protein:creatinine ratio is normal for her postconceptual age. Structural renal etiologies and renovascular etiologies have not been excluded, therefore, a renal ultrasound, ideally with Doppler, would be appropriate. A voiding cystourethrogram could be considered, especially if the infant had a history of symptomatic urinary tract infection, but it would not be appropriate as the next test to be performed before an ultrasound. Similarly, a plasma renin activity and aldosterone level could be considered, however they are typically not necessary if first-line evaluation is able to identify an alternative etiology. If used, however, ensure the use of age-appropriate normative data. PREP Pearls Measurement technique is a significant challenge in assessing blood pressure and diagnosing hypertension in infants, in particular neonates in the intensive care unit. Normal blood pressure values change and increase over the first 2 weeks of life. For neonates who were born prematurely, blood pressure increases with increasing post-conceptual age even beyond the first 2\n\nweeks of age. Blood pressure elevation is reasonably common in infants with a history of prematurity. Fortunately, the natural history of hypertension in these infants seems to be transient, though they seem to have a higher incidence again as teenagers and young adults. Once hypertension is confirmed in a neonate, evaluation should be considered for secondary etiologies such as structural renal disease, renovascular and cardiovascular disease, functional renal disease, iatrogenic cause, and neuroendocrine and metabolic etiologies.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) and has developed hypokalemia secondary to hydrochlorothiazide. The best option is to start amiloride therapy, which will decrease urinary potassium losses; this treatment has an additive effect on decreasing urine output in patients with NDI. Acetazolamide is as successful as a thiazide- amiloride combination in animal models of lithium-induced NDI but not in patients with congenital NDI. Decreased protein intake is not recommended in children with NDI. Decreased salt intake is highly recommended to decrease renal solute and osmotic load but will not treat the hypokalemia in this patient. Thiazide diuretics inhibit sodium chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, which results in intravascular volume depletion and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This process results in a decreased glomerular filtration rate and increased reabsorption of sodium and water from the proximal tubule, with decreased distal delivery and thus decreased urinary volume. In contrast, loop diuretics decrease accumulation of sodium chloride in the interstitium, which is critical for the generation of concentrated urine; in patients with NDI, this would be counterproductive. Thiazide diuretics in the presence of decreased renal solute load can decrease urine volume by approximately 50% to 70% in patients with congenital NDI. However, this effect is dependent on following a low-solute diet. Amiloride is often used in conjunction with thiazide diuretic for its potassium-sparing effect. Prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been used to decrease urine output in patients with congenital NDI. However, these patients are at risk for acute kidney injury because they are already at risk for volume depletion at baseline. Other adverse effects include gastrointestinal bleeding and hyponatremia when used in combination with thiazide diuretics.\n\nNovel therapeutic agents, including chemical chaperones to promote escape of the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) from the endoplasmic reticulum, are being studied. These chaperones will be useful in patients without a complete loss of V2R function but not in patients with deletions or insertions in the V2R gene. V2R antagonists, which can bind to the mutated V2R and induce proper folding and release from the endoplasmic reticulum, are also being studied. Gene therapy may eventually be possible for children with congenital NDI. PREP Pearls Children with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus are seen within the first year of their life with failure to thrive, polyuria, polydipsia, hypernatremia, and intermittent fever.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has recurrent gross hematuria with proteinuria and mild hypertension. Worldwide, the most common cause of recurrent glomerular hematuria with normal complements is IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy is characterized by mesangial deposition of IgA on a kidney biopsy specimen. The patient has normal complements and a negative antinuclear antibody result, making lupus nephritis (which would present with a “full house” pattern of IgM, IgG, IgA, C3, and C1q immune deposition) unlikely. Similarly, his normal complements and negative streptozyme result make postinfectious glomerulonephritis or C3 glomerulopathy (both of which would present with C3 deposition) less likely.\n\nIgA is the main immunoglobulin that provides mucosal immunity. There are 2 types of IgA (IgA1 and IgA2). IgA1 is the predominant form of IgA in the serum, saliva, respiratory tract, and small intestine; it is typically a monomer. IgA2 is produced by secretory lymphoid tissues as in the colon and is typically a dimer. IgA1 has a hinge region with serine and threonine amino acids that undergo post translational modification with glycosylation. There are both O- and N- glycosylations of the region. Impaired glycosylation leads to formation of galactose (Gal)–deficient IgA1. Increased circulating Gal-deficient IgA1 is prevalent in patients who develop IgA nephropathy. In the kidney, circulating IgA1 is cleared by the mesangial cells. IgA1 binds receptors (ie, transferrin receptors [TfR, CD71] and -1,4-galactosyltransferase1 [GalT1] receptors). The lack of glycosylation may impair binding and clearance of IgA. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified association of IgA nephropathy with genetic variants in genes involved in IgA1 post transcriptional glycosylation, such as ST6GAL1, C1GALT1, and C1GALT1C1. However, not all people with Gal-deficient IgA1 develop IgA nephropathy, and not all patients with IgA nephropathy have Gal-deficient IgA1. There is a 4-hit hypothesis for the development of IgA nephropathy (Figure): 1. Genetic and/or epigenetic changes lead to the formation of Gal-deficient IgA1. Infections or environmental stimuli may also stimulate increased IgA1 production. 2. Antibodies form to Gal-deficient IgA1. These anti–Gal-deficient IgA1 antibodies are most commonly IgG2 or less commonly IgA1 isotypes. 3. Circulating immune complexes of Gal-deficient IgA1 form and activate complement. Immune complex binding to the FcαRI (an IgA receptor constitutively expressed in myeloid cells, such as neutrophils) may also trigger production of reactive oxygen species and cytokine release. 4. There is deposition of immune complexes in the mesangium, which may occur by deposition of circulating immune complexes or in situ formation of complexes in the mesangium. This triggers mesangial cell proliferation and increased matrix production, ultimately leading to glomerular injury. Activation of the alternative complement pathway\n\nlikely contributes to this damage. In addition to associations with alterations in glycosylation, GWAS have found that genetic variations in genes associated with innate immunity, complement regulation, and maintenance of the intestinal mucosal barrier and IgA production are associated with IgA nephropathy. However, gene variants explain less than 10% of the overall risk for IgA nephropathy. PREP Pearls The most common cause of recurrent glomerular hematuria with normal complements is IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy is caused by antibodies to galactose-deficient IgA1. These antibodies form immune complexes that deposit in the mesangium, triggering complement activation and cytokine activation. Genome-wide association studies have found that genetic variations in genes associated with IgA glycosylation, innate immunity, complement regulation, maintenance of the intestinal mucosal barrier, and IgA production are associated with IgA nephropathy. However, gene variants explain less than 10% of the overall risk for IgA nephropathy.

    "explanation": "Magnesium is the second-most abundant intracellular divalent cation. The kidney filters approximately 70% to 80% of magnesium; 30% is protein bound and 15% is complexed with serum anions. Magnesium is more than 90% intracellular, and the skeleton is the largest reservoir. Hypomagnesemia is defined as total serum magnesium less than 1.7 mg/dL (0.7 mmol/L). This condition may not indicate true magnesium deficiency because serum magnesium correlates poorly with total body magnesium. Magnesium is important in DNA synthesis, neuromuscular transmission, intracellular signaling, bone formation, cardiovascular tone, and regulation of sodium, calcium, and potassium ion channels.\n\nHypomagnesemia may present with neurologic symptoms, including weakness, paresthesia, tremors, confusion, cardiac arrhythmias, failure to thrive, chondrocalcinosis, coma, or even death. Symptomatic patients usually have magnesium levels below 1.2 mg/dL (0.5 mmol/L). The regulation of magnesium is an interplay between the intestine, kidney, and bone. In the gastrointestinal tract, the majority of magnesium is absorbed in the jejunum and ileum via paracellular pathways regulated by tight junction protein claudins and zona occludens, and active transcellular absorption in the colon using the transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM6). Renal regulation includes passive reabsorption with sodium and water in the proximal tubule (15% to 25%); the majority is reabsorbed paracellularly in the thick ascending limb of Henle regulated by claudin-16 and claudin-19, and the remaining 5% to 10% in the distal convoluted tubule through apical TRPM6. There are 2 magnesium channels: TRPM6 localized to the intestine, distal convoluted tubule, and testes that is active in epithelial magnesium transport and TRPM7, expressed in tissues and involved in cellular homeostasis. Hypomagnesemia may also be associated with hypokalemia due to stimulation of the renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channel, resulting in increased potassium excretion and hypocalcemia due to impaired parathyroid hormone release or parathyroid hormone resistance. In the vignette, the most likely etiology for the hypomagnesemia is tacrolimus therapy, which has been reported in studies to inhibit the renal magnesium channel TRPM6 in the distal convoluted tubule. Active transcellular transport of magnesium in the distal convoluted tubule requires TRPM6 in the apical epithelium, which is the same as the intestinal TRPM6, and both are positively regulated by epidermal growth factor activated pathways. Impaired intestinal absorption has been described with the use of proton pump inhibitors possibly due to less TRPM6 activity in the gastrointestinal tract or decreased intestinal acidity or lower paracellular absorption. However, this patient does not have any gastrointestinal symptoms, and he is not on any proton pump inhibitors. Abnormalities in tight junction claudin-16 and claudin-19 proteins\n\nare associated with familial hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC). Claudin-19 mutations may also present with ocular abnormalities, including nystagmus, macular coloboma, or myopia. The majority of the patients with CLDN16 or CLDN19 mutations are seen during early childhood with recurrent urinary tract infection, polyuria, polydipsia, nephrolithiasis, and failure to thrive with high risk of progressive renal failure. Hypomagnesemia resulting from direct renal tubular injury has been demonstrated with the use of medications such as cisplatin, gentamicin, and amphotericin. Etiologies for hypomagnesemia can be classified into 3 categories: 1. Impaired gastrointestinal absorption includes dietary deprivation, diarrhea, small bowel bypass surgeries, malabsorption, and pancreatitis. Medications such as proton pump inhibitors may inhibit the TRPM6 and TRPM7 channels. Genetic mutations in the magnesium channels; malabsorption; and inflammatory bowel disease, including coeliac and regional enteritis, chronic alcoholism, and short gut syndrome, may also cause hypomagnesemia. 2. Increased urinary magnesium, including the use of medications (eg, loop and distal diuretics, cisplatin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, amphotericin, aminoglycoside, rapamycin), diabetes, and genetic mutations, which can cause hypomagnesemia (Table). Bartter syndrome usually presents with hypokalemia, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, failure to thrive, nephrocalcinosis, polyuria and polydipsia, and at times, hypomagnesemia. The more common Gitelman syndrome has similar symptoms as Bartter syndrome but usually presents at an older age with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Chondrocalcinosis has been described in adult patients. Genetic mutations of TRPM6 and TRPM7 may present with severe hypomagnesemia, seizures, tetany, low parathyroid hormone levels, and hypocalcemia, which is resistant to intravenous calcium. Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia due to activating mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor may present with hypomagnesemia, tetany, seizures, low parathyroid hormone levels, and\n\nhypercalciuria. 3. Cellular shift post parathyroidectomy is due to increased bone formation and mineralization, refeeding syndrome, total parenteral nutrition, oscarnet usage, lactation, and massive blood transfusion. Chronic metabolic acidosis reduces TRPM6 expression, and metabolic alkalosis increases TRPM6 activity. PREP Pearls Serum magnesium is regulated by the gastrointestinal and renal mechanisms. Hypomagnesemia may be associated with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Intravenous magnesium should be administered if symptomatic.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette is seen with subacute constitutional symptoms preceding a nephritic syndrome, manifesting as hypertension, oliguria, hematuria, proteinuria, and decreased urine output. She has additional systemic findings, including palatal ulcerative lesions and adventitious breath sounds with hypoxemia, concerning for a pulmonary renal syndrome. The tempo of her clinical course is concerning for rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, with progressive oliguria and severe kidney dysfunction, and the results of additional laboratory serologic tests are notable for a positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titer with detection of antimyeloperoxidase (anti-MPO) antibodies. These findings are consistent with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), a systemic vasculitis associated with few or no immune deposits and necrotizing lesions in the small vessels of affected organs. The pathologic hallmark of AAV in the kidney is necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. Of the biopsy images provided, Response Choice C is the\n\ncorrect answer because it shows a necrotizing lesion in a segment of the glomerular tuft in the 12- to 1-o’clock position. Immunofluorescence in this patient would show few or no immune deposits in the glomerular capillary loops and mesangium (pauci-immune glomerulonephritis). These focal lesions are caused by leakage of plasma constituents after local vessel wall necrosis, leading to activation of the coagulation cascade and production of fibrin. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis can be divided into ANCA with antibodies against proteinase 3 (anti-PR3) or anti-MPO and clinically can be subdivided into microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and renal-limited vasculitis (RLV). As the names imply, unlike MPA there is extravascular granulomatous inflammation seen in GPA and EGPA in addition to necrotizing vasculitis. Because ANCA-associated vasculitis is a small vessel disease, the most common clinical manifestations are related to damage of the pulmonary and glomerular capillaries, leading to sinopulmonary symptoms (eg, epistaxis, sinusitis, oral or nasal ulcers, pulmonary nodules, and hemorrhage) and kidney disease. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis are serious complications of AAV, which contribute to most morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. Response Choice A shows segmental sclerosis in the perihilar region of a glomerular tuft in the 6- to 8-o’clock position in the absence of other significant light microscopic abnormalities, consistent with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Response Choice B shows a glomerulus with mesangial expansion and hypercellularity, commonly associated with immune deposits in the mesangium, as can be seen in IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society class II). Because ANCA vasculitis is a pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, this pathology would not be expected on kidney biopsy. Response Choice D shows a glomerulus with thickened capillary loops (wire loop lesions), a light microscopic finding seen in membranous nephropathy.\n\nPREP Pearls Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis that affects multiple organ systems, with high morbidity and mortality related in particular to sinopulmonary and kidney involvement. The hallmark glomerular pathology of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis is pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has clinical and laboratory findings consistent with mineralocorticoid excess. History of consanguinity, low birthweight followed by growth restriction, polyuria, and polydipsia, along with hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and suppressed serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity are indicative of underlying apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) in the patient. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess is caused by congenital deficiency of the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2). Deficiency of 11β-HSD2 leads to excess cortisol, which binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), leading to features of mineralocorticoid excess. Though AME is a congenital disorder, most patients are seen after infancy with features of failure to thrive, and polyuria and polydipsia (reduced concentrating ability secondary to prolonged hypokalemia). The late presentation despite congenital deficiency has been linked to age-related MR expression and development of the mineralocorticoid response. Typically AME is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and most of the described cases are homozygous carriers and may also have a history of parental consanguinity. A genotype-phenotype correlation has been reported between the severity of the partial inhibition of the 11β-HSD2 enzyme induced by these mutations and the clinical findings. Treatment of AME includes blocking excess mineralocorticoid activity. This can be achieved by MR blockers (spironolactone, eplerenone) or diuretics decreasing activity of the aldosterone-sensitive sodium channel in the collecting tubules (amiloride, triamterene). The treatment goals are similar to those of primary hyperaldosteronism and aim at normalization of serum potassium and blood pressure.\n\nOf the 2 MR blockers, eplerenone is the newer, more expensive alternative with fewer side effects. Spironolactone, however, has a higher affinity for MR compared with eplerenone; it is also a progesterone agonist and androgen receptor antagonist, resulting in side effects such as breast tenderness and menstrual irregularities in women and impotence, decreased libido, and gynecomastia in men. Treatment with spironolactone is associated with a dose-dependent incidence of gynecomastia and is reported at nearly 7% for doses less than 50 mg/day and 52% for doses higher than 150 mg/day. Spironolactone may also be associated with minor gastrointestinal symptoms. Headache is the main side effect reported with eplerenone. High doses of spironolactone may be needed to block the mineralocorticoid side effects; initial therapy with amiloride or triamterene may be initiated with improved side effect profile. Despite less side effects reported with eplerenone, therapy with low-dose (less side effects) spironolactone is considered because of the costs (comparable dose of eplerenone costs approximately 10 times that of spironolactone). If MR blockade and antagonism is not effective or tolerated, the next step in treating AME patients is with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone suppresses adrenocorticotropic hormone production and reduces endogenous cortisol production. Prolonged treatment with dexamethasone is associated with side effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy. Thiazide diuretics are indicated in patients with AME in whom hypercalciuria and/or nephrocalcinosis is present. Cure of AME has been reported after kidney transplantation because of the normal 11β-HSD2 activity of the transplanted kidney. Decreasing glomerular filtration rate with prostaglandin inhibitors (indomethacin) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers is indicated for patients with Bartter or congenital nephrotic syndrome. Though patients with Bartter syndrome have hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, these patients, unlike the patient in the vignette, have low or normal blood pressures and have elevated serum aldosterone.\n\nGlucocorticoid replacement (prednisone) is indicated in the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by enzyme deficiency in the synthesis of corticosteroids, mineralocorticoid, or male sex hormones. Female patients with severe or classic CAH resulting from 21-hydroxylase deficiency (95% of patients with CAH) have ambiguous or atypical external genitalia (masculinization or virilization) because of androgen excess (absent in the patient in the vignette). Along with glucocorticoid replacement, mineralocorticoids (fludrocortisone) and salt supplements are indicated for such patients. PREP Pearls Treatment of apparent mineralocorticoid excess aims at blocking excess mineralocorticoid activity with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (spironolactone, eplerenone) or diuretics that decrease the activity of the aldosterone-sensitive sodium channel in the collecting tubules (amiloride, triamterene) High doses of spironolactone may be needed to block the mineralocorticoid side effects.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has a critical and rapid decrease in her serum sodium level and symptomatic hyponatremia. Her management warrants an emergency intervention to bring the serum sodium level back toward normal, making hypertonic saline the most appropriate treatment. Presenting with an acute gastrointestinal illness resulting in moderate dehydration, the patient’s decrease in circulating volume has stimulated activity of both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as well as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The initial administration of saline helped address her body fluid disorder and clearly improved her clinical condition. Feeling better, her appetite improved, and she was allowed to drink apple juice, with the thought that this would further assist in her rehydration. Given that ADH was stimulated, the apple juice intake led to her kidney retaining free water, acutely lowering her serum sodium level after her unrestricted intake of apple juice, essentially an oral free water solution with respect to tonicity.\n\nWhen managing hyponatremic dehydration, it is important to provide the patient with a sodium chloride–based solution to allow RAAS to help restore the sodium and volume deficit concurrently. Although solutions with inadequate sodium content may be able to correct the volume disorder, they risk worsening of the hyponatremia. Clinical symptoms of hyponatremia in an infant or toddler may include changes in energy, mental status, and seizures and represent signs of critical brain swelling as the hypotonic extracellular volume shifts intracellularly. Administration of hypertonic saline is additionally appropriate given the acuity of the patient’s symptoms, recognizing that she has not had long- standing hyponatremia with intracellular compensations to adjust for this context.

Hyponatremia may present clinically in an infant or toddler as changes in energy or mental status and/or seizures.

    "explanation": "Growth failure is a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children, and nearly 40% to 50% of children with end-stage renal disease have an adult height in the less than third percentile compared with healthy young adults. Pediatric studies evaluating patients with progressive CKD have reported a progressive decline in height velocity and positive correlation between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and height SD score. The cause of growth failure in children with CKD is multifactorial (Table). In view of the multifactorial origin, it is currently recommended that other potentially treatable risk factors for growth failure be diagnosed and adequately treated before initiation of growth hormone (GH) therapy. According to European Society of Pediatric Nephrology (ESPN) guidelines for GH therapy in children with CKD, “Target hemoglobin concentrations as recommended by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines should be achieved before starting GH.” To that end, it is important to note the presence of anemia in the patient in the vignette (per KDIGO, anemia is diagnosed in children 5 to 12 years of age if the hemoglobin level is <11.5 g/dL). Anemia in the patient could be secondary to iron deficiency and possible poor nutritional intake overall. Therefore, it is important to assess nutritional intake and optimize calorie and protein intake before starting GH therapy. Furthermore, if nutritional and iron (other nutrients, such as vitamin B and folate deficiency) are not identified, the patient should be evaluated 12 for other causes (eg, chronic infection, unidentified blood loss, and hemolytic conditions among others).\n\nThe GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis is an important determinant of longitudinal bone growth, skeletal maturation, metabolism, and bone mass acquisition during puberty. In CKD, insensitivity to GH has been reported and forms the basis of recommendations for administration of supraphysiologic doses of recombinant human GH for growth failure. Growth hormone insensitivity has been associated with reduced density of GH receptors in target organs (especially liver), postreceptor Janus kinase/signal activation by GH, and reduced bioavailability of IGF-1. More than 95% of IGF is bound to the IGF-binding protein (IGFBP), and only 1% of IGF-1 is in the free bioactive form. IGFBPs are in slight excess (approximately 25%) of IGF; however, in preterminal renal failure, IGFBPs are 150% in excess of IGFs, and in end-stage renal disease, this increases to almost 200%, thereby reducing the bioavailability of IGF. According to consensus guidelines, primary deficiency of GH (as evidenced by low IGF-1 level) and thyroid hormone (thyrotropin and free triiodothyronine) should be ruled out before initiation of GH therapy. Furthermore, according to the ESPN guideline, assessment of IGFBP3 serum concentrations is not indicated because of commercially available IGFBP3 immunoassays showing falsely elevated IGFBP3 serum levels secondary to cross-reactivity with low-molecular-mass IGFBP. Therefore, IGFBP3 levels (normal in this patient) are not a contraindication to GH therapy. Despite consensus statements on the use of GH in children with CKD, there are no clear guidelines regarding initiation and monitoring of GH therapy. According to the ESPN recommendations, GH therapy should be considered for children 6 months or older with stage 3 to 5 CKD or undergoing dialysis who present with a height between the third and 10th percentiles but persistent low height velocity (<25th percentile). According to the US consensus committee guidelines, the target pediatric populations for GH therapy include children with clinically defined CKD (GFR <75 mL/min/1.73 2 m ) and significant growth impairment (height SD score <–1.88 and third percentile or height velocity SD score <−2.00). Therefore, CKD stage (stage 3 for the patient in the vignette) and height percentile are not contraindications for GH therapy.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of GH therapy in children with CKD have been reported in various studies. Apart from evaluation for and treatment of metabolic and nutritional factors that affect growth, pubertal stage and bone age assessment is indicated to evaluate growth potential. Furthermore, baseline hip and knee radiography and fundoscopic examination are recommended to monitor for slipped capital femoral epiphysis and benign intracranial hypertension. PREP Pearls In children with chronic kidney disease, there is a progressive decline in height velocity and a positive correlation between glomerular filtration rate and height SD score. Safety and efficacy of growth hormone therapy in children with chronic kidney disease and growth failure have been proven in numerous trials. In view of the multifactorial origin of growth failure in children with chronic kidney disease, it is currently recommended that other potentially treatable risk factors for growth failure be diagnosed and adequately treated before initiation of growth hormone therapy.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has oliguric acute kidney injury with hypertension, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis with ultrasonography findings of lower urinary tract obstruction (UTO). The history of enuresis and straining to void, in addition to imaging findings of bilateral hydroureteronephrosis with a thickened bladder wall, is most suggestive of a late presentation of posterior\n\nurethral valves (PUVs). Voiding cystourethrography revealing valves with dilation of the posterior urethra and a trabeculated bladder would be the imaging study of choice to diagnose PUVs. Urinary tract obstruction can occur at the level of the kidney, ureter, bladder, or urethra. Among adults, malignant tumors, renal calculi, and prostatic hypertrophy are the most common causes of UTO. Among children, anatomical abnormalities, such as PUVs, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and ureterovesical junction obstruction, account for most UTOs. Posterior urethral valve occurs as a result of an obstructing persistent urogenital membrane during urethral development and is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in children (despite being found exclusively in boys). Posterior urethral valves are most commonly diagnosed by prenatal imaging that shows bilateral hydronephrosis, dilated bladder, thickened bladder wall, dilated posterior urethra with a keyhole appearance, and oligohydramnios. Among patients whose conditions are not diagnosed prenatally, postnatal diagnosis is usually made after a febrile urinary tract infection. Posterior urethral valves can also rarely present in older boys in the setting of urinary tract infection, enuresis, straining to void, poor urinary stream, and polyuria. Urinary tract obstruction can present with oliguric or anuric acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of complete bilateral obstruction. However, patients can have normal urine output or even polyuria with partial obstructions. Acute kidney injury due to UTO occurs as a result of increased intratubular pressure, leading to renal vasoconstriction and a reduction in glomerular blood flow via release of vasoactive mediators, such as angiotensin II and thromboxane. Tubular ischemia subsequently occurs as a result of decreased glomerular blood flow. Obstructed kidneys also release chemotactic factors that lead to tubular inflammation and fibrosis. After relief of acute UTO, patients frequently develop polyuria because of decreased concentrating ability as a result of tubular injury. After UTO is relieved, most renal recovery\n\nis observed within the first 7 to 10 days. Slow improvement may continue for additional weeks to months; however, with chronic obstruction, irreversible kidney damage may occur as a result of fibrosis. Urinary tract obstruction needs to be differentiated from other forms of oliguric AKI, including prerenal, acute tubular necrosis, and glomerulonephritis. Urinary findings can help to differentiate these causes of oliguric AKI. In prerenal AKI due to volume depletion or decreased effective circulating volume, low renal blood flow activates the renin-angiotensin system and release of antidiuretic hormone, leading to increased tubular reabsorption of sodium and water. Therefore, the urine is typically concentrated (specific gravity >1.020), with low urine sodium (<20 mEq/L [<20 mmol/L]) and low fractional excretion of sodium (<1% in children or <2% in neonates). In oliguric AKI due to acute tubular necrosis, the urine sodium level is elevated (>40 mEq/L [>40 mmol/L]), with elevated fractional excretion of sodium (>2%). Urine microscopy reveals muddy brown or granular casts. In oliguric AKI due to glomerulonephritis, urinalysis typically reveals hematuria, proteinuria, and red blood cell casts. In cases of AKI due to UTO, the urinalysis findings may be normal or reveal mild hematuria, proteinuria, or pyuria. As seen in the patient in this vignette, UTO can cause secondary type 4 renal tubular acidosis as a result of aldosterone resistance, leading to hyperkalemia and non–anion gap metabolic acidosis. Ultrasonography is typically the first-line imaging modality to evaluate for UTO. Ultrasonography has a high negative predictive value (98%) in ruling out obstruction. Ultrasonography can also evaluate the renal parenchyma, with echogenic kidneys or parenchymal scarring suggestive of more chronic obstruction or damage. Mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) furosemide renal scan would be helpful in evaluating for certain types of UTO, such as ureteropelvic junction obstruction, but would not be the imaging test of choice for diagnosing PUVs. Noncontrast computed tomography can be considered if there is a high suspicion for obstructing renal calculi. Kidney biopsy may be indicated to diagnose various intrinsic causes of AKI but is not typically used in cases of UTO.\n\nPREP Pearls Posterior urethral valves are the most common cause of lower urinary tract obstruction in children. Posterior urethral valves are most commonly diagnosed prenatally but should be considered in older boys who present with urinary tract infection, enuresis, or polyuria.

    "explanation": "Hyperkalemia can induce life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The earliest signs of conduction abnormalities are peaked T waves, which may be evident in children and adults at potassium levels of 5.5 to 6.5 mEq/L (5.5-6.5 mmol/L). The rate of increase can be more important than the absolute serum potassium level: patients with chronic hyperkalemia are less likely to show conduction abnormalities than those with rapid increase. Worsening of hyperkalemia can lead to loss of p-waves, widening of the QRS complex, sine wave pattern, and asystole.\n\nThe patient in the vignette presents with hyperkalemia with peaked T waves. In addition to a rapid increase in potassium levels attributable to tumor lysis syndrome, the patient’s hypocalcemia increases the risk of cardiac conduction abnormalities. The most important first treatment is to administer intravenous calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac cell membrane against depolarization. There are several treatments available to lower serum potassium levels (Table). In the acute care setting, albuterol and/or insulin/glucose infusion will drive potassium inside cells. Treatment of acidosis will also shift potassium into cells. However, these are temporizing measures until potassium removal can be achieved with other means. In patients without oliguria, furosemide and/or a thiazide can be used to achieve urinary potassium excretion. However, diuretics alone should not be used as a monotherapy in life- threatening hyperkalemia. Short-term dialysis may be necessary in those with an inability to respond to furosemide. Potassium binders may be used to increase gastrointestinal excretion. Primarily they should be used to prevent further increase in those with mild hyperkalemia and together with other interventions in severe hyperkalemia. Via cation exchange, they prevent further absorption of potassium from the intestine but may not achieve potassium excretion. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) has been used since the 1950s as a potassium binder. It comes as a powder or suspension and can be given orally or per rectum. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate exchanges sodium for potassium. However, it can cause several complications. First, the sodium content is approximately 100 mg/g, and thus its use can lead to hypernatremia. The resin is also not fully selective for potassium: hypocalcemia and/or hypomagnesemia are potential adverse effects. The suspension is not very palatable, sometimes leading to poor adherence. Gastrointestinal adverse effects (eg, nausea, constipation, and diarrhea) are common as well. More serious gastrointestinal adverse effects, including ulceration, bleeding, ischemic colitis, perforation, and bowel necrosis, have\n\nbeen reported. A recent study found increased risk for these serious complications in adults with chronic kidney disease. In particular, commercially available formulations with sorbitol increase the risk of these gastrointestinal complications. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate should be avoided in cases of recent bowel surgery and in those at risk for gastrointestinal obstruction. In addition, oral administration to neonates is contraindicated because of cases of concretion of the resin in the stomach and bowel. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate has also been associated with necrotizing enterocolitis, especially in preterm neonates. Caution should be used with rectal administration in infants and children because of the risk of impaction of the resin. Instead of enteral administration to neonates and infants with chronic kidney disease (CKD), many pediatric nephrologists use extracorporeal dosage in which the resin is mixed into infant formula or expressed breast milk. The resin (typically 0.5-1 g of SPS powder per 100 mL of formula or breast milk) binds with potassium in exchange for sodium, lowering potassium content of the formula. After binding has occurred, the resin is allowed to settle to the bottom for at least 60 minutes, and the formula or breast milk is carefully decanted off the top. Only the decanted breast milk or formula (NOT the resin) is ingested by the infant. Electrolytes need to be monitored, however, because the resin can also bind calcium, magnesium, and phosphate and increase the sodium content of the formula. Two newer alternative binders have been approved for use for treatment of hyperkalemia in adults. Patiromer sorbitex calcium is a nonabsorbed, cation exchange polymer that contains a calcium-sorbitol counterion. Patiromer exchanges calcium for potassium. Patiromer is not fully specific to potassium, and similar to SPS, potential adverse effects include hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and flatulence). More severe gastrointestinal adverse events have not been reported, but use in those at risk for bowel obstruction or motility disorders is discouraged. Patiromer may also bind other medications and should be administered at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after other\n\nmedications. In a recent study of adults with CKD and resistant hypertension, addition of patiromer allowed more adults to continue spironolactone treatment. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is an insoluble, inorganic, nonpolymer zirconium silicate compound. Unlike SPS and patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is a selective cation exchange agent for potassium (>25 times greater affinity for potassium than for calcium and magnesium ions). In exchange for potassium, it releases hydrogen and sodium ions. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate lowers potassium levels in adults with CKD and in those with elevated potassium before hemodialysis. Fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects are reported, but use in patients with motility issues or risk of bowel obstruction is discouraged. Dose-dependent edema has been reported as an adverse effect as well as QTc prolongation. PREP Pearls The most important first treatment for hyperkalemia with signs of cardiac toxic effects is to give intravenous calcium gluconate. The rate of increase can be more important than the serum potassium level: patients with chronic hyperkalemia are less likely to show conduction abnormalities than those with rapid increase. Increased risk for serious gastrointestinal adverse effects of sodium polystyrene sulfonate, including ulceration and bleeding, have been reported in adults with chronic kidney disease.

    "explanation": "Thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by thinning of the lamina densa of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) seen on electron microscopy. Thin GBMs can be seen in 5% to 9% of all biopsy specimens, although TBMN is clinically diagnosed in approximately 1% of the population. Even though it is often familial, with a family history of hematuria in 30% to 50% of cases, and the clinical course is relatively benign with excellent long-term prognosis, the\n\nterminology “benign familial hematuria” used in the past to describe TBMN is out of favor. In fact, up to 30% of patients may develop renal insufficiency and hypertension later on in life, hence long-term follow-up is recommended. Several different heterozygous mutations of COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes encoding α-3 and α-4 chains of type IV collagen may be identified in patients with TBMN; this is similar to patients with autosomal dominant Alport syndrome, or “carriers” of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome, hence there is a phenotypic overlap between these 2 conditions. However, in most cases, the heterozygous genetic defect in TBMN does not lead to the secondary processes that result in proteinuria, impaired renal function, and renal fibrosis that is observed in patients with Alport syndrome. Some patients with TBMN may have no genetic defect identified. The diagnosis of TBMN is usually made from a benign presentation and clinical course with microscopic hematuria (very rarely, gross hematuria) in the absence of proteinuria and renal insufficiency. It is associated with a positive family history of hematuria and a negative family history of renal insufficiency (as in the patient in the vignette). A renal biopsy confirms the diagnosis, although is usually not performed in patients with familial isolated glomerular hematuria unless the clinical manifestations progress, with appearance of proteinuria or renal dysfunction. Light microscopy findings are usually unremarkable, with normal glomerulus and mesangium. Light microscopy is too insensitive to detect GBM thinning, hence it appears normal in thickness, contour, and texture. Glomerular basement membrane thinning can be better appreciated by periodic acid– Schiff or Jones’ methenamine silver staining, but results must be confirmed by electron microscopy. Red blood cells and, occasionally, red cell casts, may be identified within the urinary space. Focal glomerulosclerosis may occur in 5% to 25% of glomeruli with progressive disease but is rare in children. The tubulointerstitial compartment is usually unremarkable, showing only minimal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis in some cases.\n\nDirect immunofluorescence staining is usually negative for complement and immunoglobulins, with no immune complex deposits. Very rarely, there may be a weak segmental mesangial positivity for C3 or IgM. In TBMN there is strong linear GBM staining for α-3,4,5 protein, however, because of the GBM thinning, the staining may appear attenuated, giving an impression of weaker positivity than normal. On electron microscopy, the cardinal feature is marked uniform thinning of GBM in more than 50% of capillary loops, compared to age-matched controls, with no thickening, lamellation, or other GBM alterations seen. However, there is a wide range of GBM thicknesses in the normal population. Glomerular basement membrane thickness also varies with age, gender, and the method of tissue preparation and measurement; hence, it is difficult to have standardized diagnostic criteria defining the degree or extent of GBM thinning required for the diagnosis of TBMN. Normal thickness of GBM is approximately 110 nm at 1 year of age; 250 nm is considered the lower limit of normal in adults. The major differential diagnosis of TBMN is Alport syndrome. Patients with Alport syndrome frequently have a history of hearing loss, characteristic eye findings, and a family history of renal failure. Father-to-son transmission is not seen in X-linked Alport syndrome. The characteristic ultrastructural feature of Alport syndrome is lamellation of the GBM, alternating with segments of thinning, although in some patients, GBM thinning is the only detectable ultrastructural abnormality. Aggregates of interstitial foam cells is a common finding in the more advanced stages of Alport syndrome and is not observed in TBMN. The α-5 chain of type IV collagen (which is the site of the primary abnormality in X-linked Alport syndrome) shows no staining along the GBM, making the diagnosis unlikely in this case. Thin basement membrane nephropathy must be distinguished from other glomerular causes of isolated hematuria such as IgA nephropathy. Patients with IgA nephropathy very commonly have gross hematuria but do not typically have a family history, and they do not have thin GBM on renal\n\nbiopsy. Glomerular basement membrane thinning is often seen in other glomerular pathologies, secondary to GBM damage and remodeling. This patient’s clinical presentation and absence of other glomerular abnormalities on renal biopsy rules out other forms of glomerulonephritides. PREP Pearls In thin basement membrane nephropathy, light microscopy typically reveals unremarkable findings, and direct immunofluorescence reveals no immune complex or complement deposition. In thin basement membrane nephropathy, there is strong linear glomerular basement membrane staining for α-3,4,5 protein like normally present. On electron microscopy, the cardinal feature is marked uniform thinning of glomerular basement membrane in more than 50% of capillary loops, compared to age-matched controls with no thickening, lamellation, or other glomerular basement membrane alterations seen.

    "explanation": "The child in the vignette has claudication in his calf muscles. This is pain elicited by exercise due to diminished blood flow to the affected muscles, which is relieved by rest. In older adults, claudication is a common symptom of arterial obstruction in peripheral artery disease, which carries similar risk factors as coronary atherosclerosis (eg, dyslipidemia, smoking, obesity). In children, claudication can occur as a result of external compression on arterial blood flow, such as from mass effect, or from intrinsic vasculopathy or vasculitis, leading to arterial stenosis. The findings in this patient of blood pressure (BP) in the stage 2 hypertension range, an abdominal bruit, and decreased lower-extremity pulses with muscle atrophy are suggestive of a\n\nvascular cause for hypertension, in particular midaortic syndrome (MAS), a rare condition caused by segmental stenosis of the the proximal abdominal aorta. The next best step in this patient’s evaluation is to obtain upper- and lower-extremity BP measurements to determine whether there is an abnormal gradient. Upper-extremity BPs are expected to be lower than BPs measured in the lower extremities by 10 to 20 mm Hg. Although this is commonly performed as a screen for coarctation of the aorta, the most common cardiothoracic cause of hypertension in children, having significant BP discrepancies between extremities can also be seen with other vascular conditions that affect the large arteries. The epidemiologic mechanisms of pediatric hypertension are changing with the current obesity epidemic in the United States. Primary hypertension, in which no specific underlying cause is identified, is becoming more common across the whole pediatric age range. However, secondary hypertension still remains an important cause in younger children, particularly with severe BP elevation, and is most commonly caused by renal parenchymal disease and renovascular disease. Renovascular hypertension is an umbrella term that refers to a group of conditions that affect renal and/or proximal arterial blood flow due to vessel stenosis. In the setting of decreased renal perfusion, the affected kidney increases renin release from the juxtaglomerular apparatus, activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The most common cause of renovascular hypertension in children and young adults is fibromuscular dysplasia, a noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic disease process that most commonly affects the renal arteries and carotid arteries. Although there is a female predominance for fibromuscular dysplasia in young adults, this is not the case in children. Other disease processes that can cause renovascular hypertension include large vessel vasculitis (eg, Takayasu arteritis), renal artery hypoplasia, and a history of umbilical artery catheterization during the neonatal period (due to renal artery injury and subsequent stenosis).\n\nMidaortic syndrome is a rare condition associated with severe narrowing in the suprarenal abdominal aorta. This syndrome may additionally involve the renal arteries and other major branches from the abdominal aorta, including the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery. The condition as a whole remains poorly defined; a systematic review found that most cases are idiopathic (64%), whereas 15% are associated with a monogenic cause and 17% were seen with inflammatory diseases. A more recent analysis looking at whole exome sequencing of children with MAS found disease-causing mutations in 15 of 35 families studied. The most common mutations were found in genes known previously to be associated with syndromic vascular disease, including NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1), JAG1 (Alagille syndrome), and ELN (Williams syndrome). Children with MAS commonly present with severe hypertension, frequently requiring multiple antihypertensive agents, and may have findings of an abdominal bruit, diminished or absent femoral pulses, postprandial abdominal pain, and claudication. Children with MAS may develop complications from severe hypertension, including heart disease (eg, left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure), hypertensive encephalopathy, and hypertensive retinopathy. Although treatment with pharmacologic therapy may control BP in some patients with mild to moderate vessel stenosis, the severity of hypertension or associated kidney impairment may require a more invasive approach. More severe cases frequently require endovascular techniques (percutaneous balloon angioplasty, with or without stent placement) or surgical management (patch angioplasty, aortoaortic or aortorenal bypass graft placement, or renal autotransplantation). Success of each of these techniques is variable based on published case series, and additional intervention is not uncommon. In most children, however, endovascular and surgical interventions have been associated with decreased antihypertensive medication burden and preservation of kidney function, and in some cases are curative.\n\nThe 2017 American Academy of Pediatrics pediatric hypertension guidelines recommend that any child with stage 2 hypertension has upper- and lower- extremity BP measurement performed during the same office visit. Although the patient has claudication and decreased lower-extremity muscle bulk, which could suggest a possible myopathy, elevation of creatine kinase level does not clearly explain his other clinical findings. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiography may be used as part of a hypertension evaluation to confirm true hypertension and screen for target organ injury, respectively, but these procedures should be performed after upper- and lower-extremity BPs have been obtained. PREP Pearls Although obesity and essential hypertension are becoming more common in children of all ages, renal parenchymal and renovascular diseases remain important causes of secondary hypertension in young children. Measurement of blood pressure in all 4 extremities is an important screening tool for vascular and renovascular causes of hypertension that should be performed in all children who present with hypertension. Common findings in children with midaortic syndrome, aside from severe hypertension, may include postprandial abdominal pain, claudication in the calf and other leg muscle groups, abdominal bruit, and diminished or absent lower-extremity pulses. In addition to pharmacologic treatment with multiple antihypertensive agents, they may require endovascular and/or surgical intervention to preserve kidney function and reduce the long-term target organ injury from severe hypertension.

    "explanation": "Hyperphosphatemia is defined as a phosphate level greater than 4.5 mg/dL (1.45 mmol/L) in adults, but normal serum levels in children are age dependent. More than 80% of phosphorus is in the skeleton, and less than 1% is in the extracellular space. The kidney is the main regulator of phosphorus absorption. Approximately 75% to 90% is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, 15% is reabsorbed in the distal tubule, and 10% to 15% is lost in the urine. There are 3 kidney sodium phosphate cotransporters, which are localized to the apical brush border membrane: NPT2a, NPT2c, and PiT-1. In the gastrointestinal tract, phosphorus is mainly absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum, both actively through the sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter NPT2b in the brush borders of the enterocytes and passively through the tight junctions. Factors that increase phosphate absorption include low-phosphorus diet, calcitriol, chronic hypocalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, and thyroid hormone. A decrease in phosphate absorption is mediated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, hyperphosphatemia, chronic hypercalcemia, metabolic acidosis, and glucocorticoids. In the vignette, despite the high PTH level, the patient remained hypocalcemic and hyperphosphatemic, making pseudohypoparathyroidism more likely. He also has features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, including short fingers, increased weight for age, speech delay, and thyroid problem. In autosomal dominant hypocalcemia or hypoparathyroidism, the PTH level is low, with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria caused by an activating mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor. FGF23 deficiency is associated with hyperphosphatemia but without significant changes in serum calcium or PTH. Vitamin D deficiency is usually associated with hypocalcemia, elevated PTH levels without hyperphosphatemia. Cause of hyperphosphatemia include the following:\n\n1. Excessive phosphate load: Usually exogenous administration of medications, including laxatives and vitamin D, lead to excessive phosphate load. Endogenous causes include massive tissue breakdown (rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, and hemolysis from blood transfusion). The short-term phosphate load exceeds the capacity of the kidney to excrete phosphorus in a short period. 2. Decreased renal excretion: Deficiency in FGF23 or PTH or resistance to actions of FGF23 or PTH leads to inappropriately low phosphorus excretion. Parathyroid hormone decreases phosphorus kidney reabsorption by decreasing expression and promoting the degradation of NPT2a, NPT2c, and PiT-2. FGF23 also reduces the expression and activity of the sodium phosphate cotransporters in the renal proximal tubule, reduces calcitriol by decreasing renal expression of 1α- hydroxylase, increases the expression of 24-hydroxylase to increase degradation, and can suppress PTH. Decreased glomerular filtration rate as seen in patients with chronic kidney disease. FGF23 abnormalities: Mutations in FGF23 coreceptor ɑ-Klotho and UDP-GalNAc transferase 3 (gene GALNT3) lead to low FGF23 levels and hyperphosphatemia, producing tumoral calcinosis in periarticular soft tissue regions, including hips, shoulders, and elbows. Hypoparathyroidism: Most common cause is injury or removal of the parathyroid gland. Functional impairment of PTH secretion can be part of the autoimmune regulator gene (AIRE) mutation (hypoparathyroidism, mucocutaneous candidiasis, adrenal insufficiency, and malabsorption) or autoimmune polyglandular failure type 1, also called autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy. Magnesium abnormalities: Hypomagnesemia leads to impaired secretion and PTH action caused by defective cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generation in the parathyroid gland. Hypermagnesemia can mimic calcium and affects the calcium receptor. Pseudohypoparathyroidism: Resistance to PTH at its receptor is characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and high PTH level. It can also be associated with reduced sensitivity to G protein–\n\ncoupled receptors, including thyroid hormone. There is impaired cAMP generation caused by accelerated degradation or impaired activation and defect in Gsα protein, which couples PTH 1 receptor to adenylyl cyclase. Mutations in the gene encoding the ɑ-subunit of the G protein cause resistance to PTH actions, especially in the proximal tubule. Albright hereditary osteodystrophy is characterized by pseudohypoparathyroidism with other clinical features, including short stature, shortened fourth metacarpal and other bones of the hands and feet, rounded face, obesity, dental hypoplasia, soft tissue calcifications, and cognitive impairment. Medications: Glucocorticoids decrease proximal tubule synthesis and abundance of NPT2a. Thyroid hormone increases phosphate reabsorption by increasing proximal tubule transcription and expression of NPT2a. Dopamine can lead to phosphaturia by reduction in expression of NPT2a in the proximal tubule. 3. Transcellular shifts: These shifts are seen in acidosis, insulin deficiency, leukemia and lymphoma, tissue ischemia, and intravascular hemolysis as in sickle cell anemia. Acidosis stimulates phosphaturia because phosphate serves as titratable acid by inhibition of sodium phosphate cotransporter activity. 4. Genetic mutations: Hyperphosphatemia with hypocalcemia can be seen in autosomal-dominant hypocalcemia or hypoparathyroidism associated with activating mutation of the calcium receptor (type 1) or gain in function of the ɑ-subunit of the G protein G11 (Gα11, type 2), which is a key mediator in calcium receptor signaling. Activating mutation of the calcium receptor increases the sensitivity to extracellular calcium, which suppresses PTH and presents with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, low PTH level, and hypercalciuria (because of the presence of calcium receptor in kidney tubule). PREP Pearls The kidney is the main regulator of phosphate reabsorption. Hyperphosphatemia is associated with abnormalities in parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor 23 activity or its receptor.\n\nABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area Know the causes of hyperphosphatemia Suggested Readings Blaine J, Chonchol M, Levi M.

    "explanation": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) serves to maintain extracellular fluid volume, in particular, circulating volume and blood pressure. Therefore, any condition that could lead to circulating volume loss or decreased blood pressure may stimulate renin. Renin is an enzyme stored and secreted by the juxtaglomerular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, a specialized part of the nephron that acts as a sensor for blood pressure and circulating volume. Juxtaglomerular cells are modified smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole. When there is\n\ndecreased blood volume, sensed as decreased stretch within the afferent arteriole, juxtaglomerular cells will release renin. Another way renin secretion is stimulated relates to the delivery of sodium chloride to the macula densa, a specialized area of the nephron at the end of the loop of Henle and the start of the distal convoluted tubule. The kidney interprets decreased delivery of sodium chloride to the macula densa cells as less blood volume or less blood pressure, and therefore, renin release is triggered. Increased sympathetic tone at the afferent arteriole is a third mechanism that will stimulate renin secretion. In hypovolemia, for example, with gastrointestinal salt and volume losses or with hemorrhage, all of these stimuli will be acting in concert to maximally stimulate RAAS to mitigate the decrease in circulating volume and blood pressure and maintain organ perfusion as best as possible. An antagonist of the sodium chloride cotransporter of the distal convoluted tubule will result in such a potent stimulus of renin. Through enhancement of renal sodium chloride losses, it will lead to decreased circulating volume and activation of the sympathetic nervous system as a response to the decreased blood pressure. Downstream of these effects there will be less sodium chloride delivered to the macula densa and stimulation of renin through this mechanism as well. In contrast, an antagonist of sodium glucose cotransport, which occurs in the proximal convoluted tubule, though it will lead to a decrease in circulating volume, will also lead to enhanced sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa. This is because the antagonism occurs upstream of the macula densa rather than downstream. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system will stimulate renin; however, the resulting increase in blood pressure and sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa will have a mitigating effect, and there will be less potent stimulation as compared to antagonism of the chloride cotransporter. Lastly, though baroreceptors are involved in renin stimulation, activation occurs when there is increased stretch as with increased blood pressure. Therefore, RAAS would be stimulated when there is decreased blood pressure and inactivation of the baroreceptors rather than activation.\n\nPREP Pearls Renin secretion is triggered by any of the following 3 mechanisms including decreased blood volume or stretch at the afferent arteriole, decreased sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa, and/or activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Hypovolemia, as may occur with gastrointestinal losses or hemorrhage, is a potent stimuli of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Antagonism of the sodium chloride cotransporter of the distal convoluted tubule will stimulate renin more so than antagonism of sodium glucose transport in the proximal tubule because the antagonism occurs upstream of the macula densa, leading to a relatively higher delivery of sodium chloride with the latter antagonist. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system will stimulate renin; however, the resulting increase in blood pressure and sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa will have a mitigating effect. Baroreceptors sense and are activated by increased stretch, as occurs with increased blood pressure. Inactivation rather than activation of baroreceptors will stimulate renin.

    "explanation": "The differential diagnosis of gross hematuria and left flank pain includes the following: 1. Urolithiasis: A serious consideration in this patient; however, lack of a positive family history and normal urine calcium-creatinine ratio make this diagnosis less likely. Thus, helical computed tomography (CT) is not indicated as a first step in the evaluation. 2. Acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis: A lack of hypertension, edema, and urine red blood cell casts and normal C3 levels make this diagnosis less likely. 3. IgA nephropathy: Back and abdominal pain and gross hematuria occur in IgA nephropathy; however, unilateral flank pain is less frequently reported. Moreover, this diagnosis requires confirmation by renal biopsy, which can be a future consideration if other less invasive diagnostic test results are negative. 4. Unilateral ureteral bleeding may be confirmed by cystoscopy and can be seen in sickle cell disease, nutcracker syndrome, and intrarenal arteriovenous malformations. However, cystoscopy is not sufficient to distinguish these conditions. 5. Nutcracker syndrome (ie, entrapment of the distal end of the left renal vein [LRV] between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery [SMA]) causes left flank pain and gross hematuria. It is more commonly seen in girls and occurs at a higher frequency after weight loss, as in the patient in the vignette. Accordingly, given the benign history, physical\n\nexamination findings, and laboratory results, nutcracker syndrome must be ruled out before proceeding to other diagnoses that will require invasive procedures. Nutcracker syndrome can be diagnosed by renal ultrasonography with Doppler, CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Given the simplicity and convenience of the procedure, renal ultrasonography with Doppler is the preferred next diagnostic step. Multiple studies have found that Doppler ultrasonography sensitivity and specificity range from 70% to 90% and 90% to 100%, respectively. In evaluating a patient with suspected nutcracker syndrome, special attention should be paid to the ratio of the peak flow velocities, specifically the proximal end (dilated) to the distal end (narrowed) of the LRV; a normal distal-proximal ratio should be less than 3.0. A distal-proximal LRV ratio over 4.0 strongly suggests nutcracker syndrome. Both CT and MRA are recommended if Doppler ultrasonography results are equivocal and for enhanced visualization of the anatomical features of LRV entrapment (Figure). Management of documented left renal vein entrapment in nutcracker syndrome is challenging. For patients younger than 18 years, conservative management is the treatment of choice, with observation for as long as 2 years because up to 75% of patients will experience complete resolution of pain and gross hematuria. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (presumably by decreasing glomerular pressure) may be helpful, especially in those who have coexisting orthostatic proteinuria. In patients with a low body mass index, a trial of increasing caloric intake to increase the perirenal fat content and potentially help separate the involved blood vessels is also suggested. In those patients in whom hematuria and flank pain fail to improve after 24 months of observation, referral to a vascular surgeon is recommended. A variety of surgical approaches have been used, including medial nephropexy with excision of renal varicosities, LRV bypass, LRV transposition, SMA transposition, and renal autotransplantation. Left renal vein stenting has also been used, but long-term follow-up studies are lacking. PREP Pearls\n\nNutcracker syndrome is entrapment of the left renal vein between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery and frequently presents with gross hematuria and left flank pain. A history of short-term weight loss in an adolescent followed by episodes of unexplained left flank pain and gross hematuria should prompt evaluation for nutcracker syndrome. Renal ultrasonography with Doppler is the preferred first diagnostic modality for nutcracker syndrome, followed by computed tomography/magnetic resonance angiography.

    "explanation": "Hematuria in a healthy term infant is uncommon. Gross hematuria in a neonate once confirmed requires urgent evaluation. Urate crystals, vaginal discharge from maternal hormonal withdrawal, skin breakdown from diaper rash, hemoglobinuria secondary to ABO incompatibility and porphyria are some of the conditions wherein hematuria is misdiagnosed. Causes of gross hematuria include but not limited to bleeding diathesis, thrombotic events, tumors, nephrocalcinosis, cortical necrosis, glomerulonephritis, urinary tract infection, trauma to the lower urinary tract, and structural malformations of the genitourinary tract. Vitamin K deficiency results in decreased activity of clotting factors and thus causes hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Vitamin K deficiency bleeding can be categorized into 3 groups based upon the age of onset. Early presentation occurs within the first 24 hours of life and presents with intracranial, intra-abdominal, and other severe bleeding conditions. Classic vitamin K deficiency is defined as bleeding within the first week of life (second day to seventh day) and is associated with less severe bleeding. Bleeding\n\nfrom 8 days and up to 6 months to 1 year of life is classified as late bleeding. There is an increased risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding if the mother is on anticonvulsants, anti-tuberculosis medications, vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin), and broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, cephalosporin). Neonates have decreased levels of vitamin K secondary to inability of the gastrointestinal tract to synthesize the required levels of vitamin K, insufficient placental transfer of vitamin K, decreased levels of vitamin K in breast milk, and decreased hepatic storage. Anemia in this infant is the consequence of bleeding and not the cause of bleeding. Neonatal lupus is an autoimmune disease secondary to transfer of autoantibodies from the mother to the neonate; the 2 commonly affected organs are the heart and the skin. Congenital heart block is the most life- threatening complication of neonatal lupus. In the absence of structural defects of the heart, neonatal lupus is responsible for 80% to 95% of cases with congenital heart block. Neonatal lupus is associated with maternal anti- Ro and anti-La autoantibodies and can be independent of maternal disease. The mothers may have clinical symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus or Sjögren syndrome during pregnancy, but in some cases the mother is completely asymptomatic when the neonate is seen with a congenital heart block. Studies have demonstrated that the presence of antibodies alone is not sufficient to cause neonatal lupus and fetal factors along with environmental factors likely play a role. Although there have been rare cases of neonatal glomerulonephritis secondary to maternal lupus presenting with gross hematuria, the neonates are not seen with bleeding from other organs as seen in this vignette. There are rare cases of traumatic birth causing gross hematuria but the history here is negative for traumatic birth even though the patient was born at home. The patient in this vignette has evidence of abnormal coagulation profile along with pulmonary hemorrhage, bleeding from venipuncture sites, and gross hematuria, which indicates generalized bleeding disorder. Breastfed with an unknown history of vitamin K administration and maternal use of anticonvulsants are the risk factors for vitamin K deficiency in this neonate.\n\nThus, of the available choices, the most likely cause of this neonate’s gross hematuria is maternal use of antiepileptic medications causing vitamin K deficiency. PREP Pearls Neonatal gross hematuria, although rare, requires thorough and rapid evaluation when confirmed. Hemorrhagic disease of the neonate should be considered in the presence of risk factors: lack of vitamin K prophylaxis, maternal use of anticonvulsants, anti-tuberculosis medications, or warfarin.

    "explanation": "The infant in the vignette presents with features typical of congenital nephrotic syndrome. Although not universal, according to a recent review, 96% of such infants are initially treated with albumin infusions for edema. Typically, these albumin infusions are accompanied by intravenous furosemide. Hypokalemia is one of the most common adverse effects of furosemide, making this the most likely adverse effect to occur in the patient in the vignette. Hypomagnesemia and hearing loss are also possible adverse effects of furosemide but occur less commonly. Hypo(not hyper)phosphatemia can also occur.\n\nThere are 2 hypotheses to explain pathogenesis of edema in nephrotic syndrome: 1. Underfill hypothesis: In underfill, the low serum albumin is thought to decrease the oncotic pressure within the blood vessel. According to the Starling principle, the hydrostatic pressure within the vessels exceeds the oncotic pressure, allowing fluid to move into the interstitial space. The kidney then senses decreased effective circulating volume and secondarily upregulates sodium and water reabsorption in response. 2. Overfill hypothesis: In overfill, proteinuria directly activates sodium and water reabsorption. Data from animal models support this hypothesis, indicating that the epithelial sodium channel is activated by filtered proteins. Other studies indicate impaired response to atrial natriuretic protein by the collecting duct. Primary sodium and water retention leads to volume overload and edema. Clinical studies suggest that patients with nephrotic syndrome are not uniform: some have clinical findings consistent with underfill and decreased effective circulating volume (eg, tachycardia, increased blood urea nitrogen– creatinine ratio, and low urinary sodium excretion), whereas others have signs of increased effective circulating volume (eg, hypertension). Optimal treatment for edema differs for patients with underfill vs overfill. Patients with underfill benefit from volume expansion with 25% albumin infusions, typically given with diuretics. In contrast, those with overfill may be at higher risk for complications of albumin infusions (flash pulmonary edema) and benefit from diuresis with diuretics alone. Although controversial, clinical studies comparing albumin and furosemide vs furosemide alone in patients with nephrotic syndrome have not consistently found a benefit of albumin infusions. An albumin level less than 2.0 mg/dL (20 g/L), a blood urea nitrogen–creatinine ratio of 15, and a fractional excretion of sodium [(FeNa)= (SCr × UNa) / (SNa × UCr) × 100] less than 0.2, or a urine potassium index UK + + + /(UK + UNa ) greater than 0.6 have been used as criteria to identify patients with underfill or volume contraction that may benefit from albumin infusions.\n\nIn one study, infants with congenital nephrotic syndrome, such as the infant in the vignette, were more likely to have underfill than children with minimal change disease or idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Albumin infusions are typically restricted to those with serum albumin levels less than 2.0 mg/dL (20 g/L). In such cases, albumin infusions may be helpful not only for expanding intravascular volume but also for delivery of furosemide to the proximal tubular for secretion by the organic anion transporters. Diuretics are a mainstay of edema treatment in nephrotic syndrome. + + − Furosemide is most commonly used and inhibits the Na K 2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Intravenous furosemide achieves more effective diuresis than oral furosemide, and higher oral doses may be needed to achieve similar effects. Other loop diuretics, such as bumetanide (which per milligram dose is more potent than furosemide) may also be used. Loop diuretics have the strongest diuretic effect. However, distal sodium reabsorption can limit the effect of loop diuretics. Thus, addition of thiazide diuretics can be useful in edema resistant to loop diuretics alone. Metolazone is a thiazide diuretic that has particularly potent effects for edema resistant to loop diuretics. Both loop and thiazide diuretics are potassium wasting. The epithelial sodium inhibitor amiloride (potassium sparing) was found in one small study to improve diuresis in childhood nephrotic syndrome, but it has not been tested in larger studies. All diuretics have adverse effects (Table). The most common adverse effects are electrolyte abnormalities. It is also important to monitor for volume contraction or intravascular depletion and acute kidney injury when treating edema in nephrotic syndrome. PREP Pearls Two hypotheses explain edema in nephrotic syndrome. In underfill, decreased effective circulating volume secondarily stimulates sodium and water reabsorption. In overfill, primary activation of renal sodium and water retention occurs. Patients with overfill can be treated with diuretics alone.\n\nThe most common adverse effects of diuretics are electrolyte abnormalities.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis with increased urinary oxalate excretion. The patient is born to consanguineous parents, and because primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is an autosomal recessive disease, there is an increased suspicion of PH in this patient. While the results of evaluation for PH are awaited, it is reasonable to administer vitamin B in 6 this patient, even though it is effective in only a subset of patients with PH1. Vitamin B is a relatively safe and well-tolerated medication. 6 PHs are rare autosomal recessive diseases with an estimated prevalence of 1 to 3 cases per 1 million population in Europe, whereas the prevalence is higher in countries where consanguineous marriages are common. Three\n\nforms of PHs have been identified thus far, and the common end point in all these disorders is overproduction of oxalate. This endogenously produced oxalate cannot be metabolized and has to be excreted in the urine, and in patients with PHs, urinary oxalate precipitates with calcium and forms calcium oxalate crystals, which are poorly soluble. Calcium oxalate deposition leads to kidney injury, and patients develop progressive chronic kidney disease. End-stage kidney disease or advanced chronic kidney disease can be present at the time of diagnosis in approximately 20% to 50% of patients with PH. PH type 1 (PH1) is caused by deficiency of the liver-specific peroxisomal alanine–glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) enzyme, which is responsible for conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. Thus, AGT deficiency results in accumulation of glyoxylate and increased production of glycolate and oxalate. AGT is encoded by the AGXT gene, and multiple mutations in this gene have been described in patients with PH1, resulting in decreased AGT catalytic activity and/or mistargeting of the enzyme from the peroxisome to the mitochondria, where it is ineffective in metabolism of glyoxylate. PH1 is the most devastating and frequent subtype of PH. Patients with Gly170Arg and Phe152Ile mutations are responsive to vitamin B (pyridoxine) and thus have 6 a better outcome compared with patients with other mutations. PH type 2 (PH2) is caused by deficiency of glyoxylate reductase– hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), which is responsible for reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate and hydroxypyruvate to ᴅ-glycerate. PH2 is not responsive to vitamin B , is less severe, and is less frequent compared with 6 PH1. PH type 3 (PH3) is caused by defects in the liver-specific mitochondrial enzyme 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase (HOGA). This enzyme plays an important role in the metabolism of hydroxyproline. The molecular mechanisms that cause glyoxylate accumulation in patients with PH3 are poorly understood. PH3 has a milder phenotype and does not usually progress to end-stage kidney disease.\n\nMost patients with PH present with nephrolithiasis; therefore, evaluation of the patient includes biochemical analysis of urine and kidney stones. Initial analysis of urine can be performed on a random urine sample, but a 24-hour urine sample is central to a thorough evaluation of a patient with nephrolithiasis. Increased urinary oxalate excretion in the presence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis and the absence of secondary causes of hyperoxaluria (enteric hyperoxaluria, increased dietary intake of oxalate precursors, and excessive vitamin C ingestion) is indicative of PH. Urinary oxalate excretion can be variable in the first year after birth but is consistently elevated after that in patients with PH. Hyperoxaluria is generally defined as 2 an oxalate excretion greater than 45 mg/1.73 m /d or greater than 0.5 2 mmol/1.73 m /d. Measurement of other metabolites, including glycolate, ʟ- glycerate, and HOGA, can be helpful in the evaluation. Urinary glycolate levels are elevated in approximately 75% of patients with PH1 and may be elevated in patients with PH3. Increased levels of urinary ʟ-glycerate were previously considered pathognomonic for PH2, but the levels are not always elevated. Increased urinary levels of HOGA are indicative of PH3. Serum levels of oxalate should be measured in patients when the glomerular filtration rate 2 (GFR) is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m . As kidney function deteriorates, oxalate deposits in multiple tissues, including heart, eyes, skin, bone, vasculature, and nervous system. Confirmatory testing includes genetic testing. However, the disadvantage of genetic testing is that deletions may not be detected unless parental studies are performed, or the mutation could be in the promoter or other regulatory sequence and thus can be missed. As genetic testing is becoming more easily available and with the use of whole exome sequencing, genetic testing may become the primary means to diagnose PH in the near future. However, appropriate expertise is required in analyzing whole exome sequencing results. A liver biopsy could be performed and enzymatic activity of AGT and GRHPR could be measured, but this is an invasive procedure, and this procedure is becoming less common. Management of PH includes increased fluid intake to dilute urinary oxalate and urinary alkalinization with citrate supplements or orthophosphates to\n\ndecrease crystallization. Administration of pyridoxine or vitamin B , a 6 cofactor for AGT, can significantly reduce urinary oxalate excretion in a subset of patients with PH1, especially in patients harboring the following mutations: Gly170Arg, Phe152Ile, and Ile244Thr. While workup and classification of PHs are awaited, a trial of pyridoxine in patients suspected to have PH is recommended because it is possible that yet unidentified pyridoxine- responsive genotypes may exist. In patients with PH, dietary elimination of oxalate is not necessarily recommended because the endogenous production of oxalate in these patients is quite high. However, avoiding excessive dietary oxalate intake is recommended, and patients should be educated on avoiding high oxalate-containing foods. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is indicated for treatment of systemic oxalosis in patients with PH. The risk of systemic oxalosis increases significantly when the serum oxalate level is greater than 30 to 45 µmol/L and 2 as the GFR decreases to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m . In contrast to patients with chronic kidney disease of other causes where RRT is initiated at 2 approximately 10 to 15 mL/min/1.73 m , RRT is initiated at a GFR of 2 approximately 30 mL/min/1.73 m in patients with PH. A combined liver- kidney transplant is the best option for patients with PH1. Patients should be 2 referred for evaluation when the GFR is approximately 45 mL/min/1.73 m because of the risk of systemic oxalosis, whereas in patients with other causes of chronic kidney disease, referral for kidney transplant occurs at a 2 GFR of approximately 20 mL/min/1.73 m . A kidney transplant alone is not beneficial because oxalate production will continue unabated, resulting in premature loss of the kidney transplant. In November 2020, lumasiran (ALN-GO1) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients with PH1. Lumasiran is an RNA interference therapeutic that specifically targets hydroxyacid oxidase 1 messenger RNA that encodes glycolate oxidase, an enzyme upstream of the disease that causes enzyme defect in PH1. Currently, lumasiran is indicated only for patients with confirmed genetic diagnosis of PH1.\n\nPREP Pearls Primary hyperoxalurias are rare autosomal recessive diseases, and 3 forms have been identified: types 1, 2, and 3. Type 1 is the most devastating and frequent subtype. While evaluation results and classification of primary hyperoxaluria in a patient are awaited, a trial of pyridoxine in patients suspected of having primary hyperoxalurias is recommended because a subset of patients with primary hyperoxalurias type 1 respond to pyridoxine. Until recently, a combined liver-kidney transplant has been the best option for patients with primary hyperoxalurias type 1. Lumasiran is an RNA interference therapeutic that specifically targets hydroxyacid oxidase 1 messenger RNA that encodes glycolate oxidase, an enzyme upstream of the disease that causes an enzyme defect in PH1.

This largely replaces the old classification types I, II and III, based on the electron microscopy (EM) findings. Treatment of MPGN depends on the pathogenesis and underlying cause. No randomized controlled trials are available in children supporting a particular treatment regimen; hence, treatment is largely based on clinical experience. IC-MPGN can be secondary to an autoimmune process, chronic infection, or monoclonal gammopathy (rare in children), in which case, the therapy should be planned as appropriate for the primary underlying cause. IC-MPGN can also be idiopathic when no underlying etiology can be identified. Patients with normal renal function, inactive urinary sediment (mild hematuria <10 red blood cells/HPF) and non-nephrotic range proteinuria, are usually treated with supportive therapy including antiproteinuric therapy with angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade. Blood pressure control is also important. If proteinuria, however, is more significant and is in the nephrotic range, immunosuppression is recommended in addition. Oral steroids are usually the first line of therapy. A calcineurin inhibitor is an alternative agent if steroids fail to achieve disease remission or is contraindicated. Some patients benefit from mycophenolate, especially those with impaired renal function with signs of acute glomerulonephritis (GN) and intact tubulointerstitial compartment on renal biopsy. Immunosuppression is unlikely to help in patients with impaired renal function with no sign of acute GN and with evidence of chronic tubulointerstitial damage. Rarely, MPGN may present as rapidly progressive crescentic GN. These patients are at risk of progression to end-stage renal disease and need to be treated aggressively and promptly with immunosuppression to salvage renal function, usually with pulse steroids (intravenous methylprednisolone) followed by oral steroids; sometimes the addition of oral or intravenous cyclophosphamide is also considered.\n\nCM-MPGN results from abnormal regulation of the alternative arm of the complement pathway as a result of which complement products are deposited in the glomerulus (C3 in C3GN and C4 in C4 glomerulopathy). Dense deposit disease (type II MPGN in the old classification) is a subtype of C3GN where there is intramembranous deposition of electron dense material giving the characteristic linear appearance of GBM on EM. In other types of C3GN, there are isolated mesangial and subendothelial, and occasionally subepithelial, C3 deposits seen on EM and IF. Generally, supportive therapy is instituted (antiproteinuric agents, anti-hypertensive agents, and lipid-lowering agents as required) for patients with normal renal function and non-nephrotic range proteinuria. If proteinuria is in the nephrotic range, and in patients with no underlying genetic mutation, additional immunosuppression is recommended, usually a combination of mycophenolate and oral steroids, in addition to the angiotensin blockade. If this fails after a trial of 6 months, treatment with eculizumab or an alternative immunosuppressive regimen is considered. In patients with known genetic defects of factor H, regular fresh frozen plasma infusions are recommended to replace the missing or the abnormal protein, irrespective of the renal function and the degree of proteinuria, and immunosuppression usually is ineffective in these patients. Rarely, MPGN may be associated with thrombotic microangiopathy, and treatment is usually geared toward the underlying condition leading to the thrombotic microangiopathy. The patient in the vignette has the dense deposit variety of the C3GN (CM- MPGN) based on the renal biopsy findings. Typically, this condition is hard to treat, and usually refractory to medical therapy, eventually progressing to end-stage renal disease in many cases. Because she has impaired renal function, and nephrotic-range proteinuria, antiproteinuric therapy alone will not be sufficient, and she will need steroids in addition to control the inflammation. Rituximab could be considered when she is in full remission or at least partial remission. Hypertension control is also crucial in this patient, and an ACE inhibitor will act both as an anti-proteinuric and anti-hypertensive agent.\n\nPREP Pearls Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a descriptive histological diagnosis characterized by mesangial hypercellularity giving the glomerular tuft a lobular appearance, along with glomerular basement membrane thickening, seen on light microscopy.

    "explanation": "The infant in this vignette has hyperammonemia. Multiple metabolic pathways in the body are responsible for the production of ammonia, which is both an important source of nitrogen for amino acid synthesis and as a waste product can be toxic at high levels. Normal levels of ammonia in the body are less than 60 to 70 µg/dL (35-40 µmol/L). The definition of ammonia levels needed for hyperammonemia depends on age. In neonates, hyperammonemia is present with an ammonia level above 170 µg/dL (100 µmol/L). In infants, children, and adolescents, the threshold for hyperammonemia to be present is lower (85 µg/dL [50 µmol/L]). Hyperammonemia has multiple effects on the body. It is toxic to neurons and can be fatal if not recognized early and treated. In neonates, hyperammonemia can result in excessive sleepiness, which then progresses to lethargy. Infants can become hypothermic because of loss of normal thermoregulation. They often feed poorly and can have defects in central ventilation, initially hyperventilation and then progressing to hypoventilation. Cerebral edema and seizures can develop before brainstem herniation. In the kidney, ammonia acts as an osmotic agent and can result in an osmotic diuresis despite an infant being hypovolemic because of poor feeding. Hyperammonemia can result from various inborn errors of metabolism, including urea cycle defects and organic acidemias. It can also result from profound liver dysfunction (such as seen with cirrhosis). The recommended further reading provides information on urea cycle defects and organic acidemias. Treatment of hyperammonemia depends on appropriate diagnosis of the cause, reduction of endogenous ammonia production, and increased clearance of ammonia through extracorporeal therapy. On initial presentation, the patient should not be given any protein. Glucose levels need to be monitored closely to avoid protein catabolism, which can contribute to ammonia production (these patients will often require high glucose infusion rates). The blood sample for ammonia needs to be collected\n\nappropriately and transported on ice to the laboratory to avoid falsely elevated levels. Nitrogen scavengers (the metabolic cocktail) can be infused in consultation with your metabolic geneticist. These scavengers are small molecules that are easily cleared by dialysis filters. For those patients who present with critically high levels of ammonia and signs of neurologic dysfunction and/or for whom metabolic cocktails are not effective at decreasing ammonia levels, renal replacement therapy should be used. Historically, peritoneal dialysis was used; however, it has limited efficacy. Hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are now the standard of care. Intermittent hemodialysis can produce rapid decreases in ammonia; however, there is the potential for rebound after discontinuation, and consideration needs to be given for the potential for dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. Intermittent hemodialysis can be used as a bridge to CRRT, although with the increased capabilities for high-volume dialysis and hemofiltration rates, it may be possible to initiate therapy with CRRT without hemodialysis first. The infant in the vignette already has signs of critical illness and impaired homeostasis attributable to his hyperammonemia. The first step in the care of this patient is to remember the ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation). Despite poor intake, the infant in the vignette is polyuric, and the laboratory study findings indicate evidence of an intravascular volume contraction. As such, he should receive a bolus of intravenous isotonic fluids to help restore intravascular volume losses. Given his markedly elevated ammonia level, he is a candidate for renal replacement therapy. Intermittent hemodialysis and CRRT are the recommended forms of dialysis because of their increased efficiency at clearing ammonia when compared with peritoneal dialysis. There are case reports of the use of therapeutic hypothermia in conjunction with renal replacement therapies; however, therapeutic hypothermia would not be the first step in management of this patient. PREP Pearls Hyperammonemia is a medical emergency that requires coordinated care among the nephrologists, critical care physicians, and metabolic\n\ngeneticists. Hyperammonemia often presents with vague symptoms, and a high clinical suspicion is needed. Intermittent hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy are the preferred forms of renal replacement therapy in patients with critical levels of ammonia and signs of neurologic dysfunction.

    "explanation": "Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) can lead to the development of renal osteodystrophy. Although invasive, bone biopsy is the gold standard to diagnose and classify renal osteodystrophy, especially in the presence of hypercalcemia, a low parathyroid hormone level, and continuing hyperphosphatemia. The most common finding is osteitis fibrosa, but over the last decade, adynamic bone disease is increasing. Adynamic bone is characterized by low bone turnover and has been described when parathyroid hormone level is less than 150 pg/mL. In the vignette, osteomalacia has been described with the use of aluminum phosphate binders. Aluminum is associated with mineralization defects, reduction in osteoclast resorption, and decrease in osteoblast number. Aluminum bone disease is usually associated with skeletal pain, fractures, hypercalcemia, and a low parathyroid hormone level even in the presence of hyperphosphatemia. The bone histology frequently associated with prolonged use of calcium-binding agents is low turnover bone disease or adynamic bone. Hypercalcemia is a common finding due to the inability of the bone to incorporate excess calcium load. Lanthanum carbonate, a non- calcium, non-aluminum–containing phosphate-binding agent, has not been shown to lead to low turnover bone disease in adult patients. There are currently no recommendations for lanthanum to be used in children because it is a heavy metal like aluminum. Sevelamer carbonate has not been shown to have significant effects on the skeleton.\n\nAluminum bone disease is now rarely seen due to avoidance of aluminum phosphate-binding agents (eg, aluminum hydroxide) and elimination of aluminum in the dialysis fluid. Aluminum has no known biological function and is rapidly excreted in the kidneys, but there are still concerns regarding its presence, albeit in small quantities, in total parenteral nutrition, infant formula, antiperspirant, medications (eg, sucralfate), and vaccine adjuvants. PREP Pearls Osteomalacia is the most frequent bone histologic finding in aluminum bone disease. Low turnover bone disease or adynamic bone can be seen with prolonged use of calcium-containing binders.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette is seen with a hypertensive emergency likely due to renal artery stenosis. On the basis of the severity of the blood pressure and evidence of end organ damage, this patient could be diagnosed with malignant hypertension (MHTN). In this scenario, a kidney biopsy is unlikely to be performed. However, if a biopsy were performed, classic changes seen with MHTN would be apparent (Response Choice D). Overall, the prevalence of MHTN is low in the general population and a rare diagnosis in children. MHTN can be defined as an extreme elevation in blood pressure along with the presence of end organ damage in at least 3 different organs. Patients are often diagnosed with severe grades of hypertensive retinopathy. However, the organ involvement can involve the kidney, heart, brain, or microangiopathy. In many cases, the first presentation of MHTN can be acute kidney failure. In the past, the prognosis was poor overall but can be somewhat improved with early detection and treatment. In children, MHTN is likely attributable to secondary causes of hypertension. Two-thirds of children are eventually diagnosed with renal parenchymal disease, with one-third attributable to aortoarteritis and fibromuscular dysplasia. In adults, most cases can be attributed to essential hypertension, which is responsible for a few cases in children. Even though biopsies are usually not needed to determine the cause of MHTN, there are a few characteristic features found on kidney biopsy. The pathological changes can be divided into 2 categories. The first category is fibrinoid necrosis of renal arterioles. The second major lesion that often accompanies the necrosis is endarteritis in renal interlobular arteries. This characteristic finding is known as onion skinning. As a result of the vasculature changes, there can be lumen narrowing and severe ischemic dysfunction of the glomeruli, which leads to activation of the renin- angiotensin system with subsequent vasoconstriction. Often early in disease, profound intimal thickening by myxoid connective tissue is apparent. Later in\n\nMHTN, the scarring, concentric thickening of vessel walls and onion skin appearance become apparent. See the Table for a complete list of pathologic findings. Mesangial hypercellularity (Response Choice A) can also be seen in IgA nephropathy, but this patient has no evidence of hematuria, which is commonly seen with IgA. An enlarged glomerulus (Response Choice B) with mesangial hypercellularity and endocapillary proliferation is consistent with a diagnosis of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. In a patient with no hematuria, minimal proteinuria, and normal complements, this diagnosis would be less likely. Epithelial cell vacuoles with cell swelling and epithelial cell flattening (Response Choice C), as well as incomplete or complete lack of the brush border, would be found in acute tubular necrosis. In this case, the creatinine level is normal, and the urine has only minimal proteinuria, making this finding less likely. PREP Pearls Malignant hypertension is a type of hypertensive emergency for which there is an extreme elevation in blood pressure along with end organ damage in at least 3 organ systems. In children, malignant hypertension is rare and often associated with a secondary cause of hypertension, with renal parenchymal disease being the most common cause. On light microscopy, the typical findings of malignant hypertension are fibrinoid necrosis and endarteritis in renal interlobular arteries, which leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin system.

    "explanation": "The child in this vignette is seen with polyuria, polydipsia, and secondary enuresis associated with a first morning urinary concentrating defect. He also has a mildly elevated serum creatinine level for his age and abnormal kidney ultrasonography findings. This constellation of findings suggests the early signs of juvenile nephronophthisis (NPHP).\n\nNephronophthisis is a monogenic disease associated with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. There are 3 major types of NPHP that are associated with the age of presentation: infantile (NPHP2 gene), juvenile (NPHP1 gene), and adolescent (NPHP3 gene); however, at least 19 different genes have been identified as monogenic causes of NPHP. Juvenile NPHP is the most common form of NPHP and accounts for at least 20% of all NPHP cases. Clinically, all patients with NPHP have a urinary concentrating defect. They generally have bland urine and early-onset anemia that is disproportionate to the degree of chronic kidney disease, likely due to destruction of erythropoietin-producing interstitial cells in the kidney. They also have growth retardation that is out of proportion to the degree of chronic kidney disease. Patients with NPHP will typically be normotensive, although hypertension can develop with progressive declines in kidney function as they approach end-stage kidney disease. All patients with NPHP eventually progress to end-stage kidney disease, with the age at onset depending on the type of NPHP: infantile NPHP (<5 years of age), juvenile (median age of 13 years), or adolescent (median age of 19 years). Renal ultrasonography will uniformly show echogenic kidneys with poor corticomedullary differentiation. Classically, individuals with NPHP have kidney cysts present at the corticomedullary junction; however, the cysts may not be seen on ultrasonography at early stages of the disease. The proteins that are mutated or deleted in nephronophthisis are all associated with the primary cilia of the cell. As such, NPHP is a ciliopathy and falls on the spectrum with other cystic kidney diseases, including autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, medullary cystic kidney disease, and Bardet-Biedl syndrome, among others. Given the importance of the primary cilia in multiple cells throughout the body, patients with NPHP may have extrarenal manifestations that can affect the eyes, brain, liver, and skeletal system. Various syndromes have been named for patients with NPHP and characteristic extrarenal manifestations, including Senior- Loken syndrome (retinitis pigmentosa), Joubert syndrome (nystagmus, coloboma, hepatic fibrosis, and vermis aplasia), Jeune syndrome (short ribs), and Meckel-Gruber syndrome (encephalocele and hepatic fibrosis).\n\nThe child in the vignette is most likely to have early-onset anemia. He is unlikely to be hypertensive or tall for his age. An elevated uric acid level may be seen in medullary cystic kidney disease type 2; however, this condition is unlikely to appear in a child and much more likely to appear in an adult. PREP Pearls Nephronophthisis is a rare autosomal recessive monogenic disease that results in early onset end-stage kidney disease due to mutations in the primary cilia. Patients with nephronophthisis are seen with urinary concentrating defects and bland urine along with anemia and growth retardation. Nephronophthisis can be associated with multiple different extrarenal manifestations depending upon the gene mutation.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette is seen with nephrotic syndrome, consisting of heavy proteinuria with subsequent hypoalbuminemia, edema, and dyslipidemia. His laboratory studies reveal mild hyponatremia, prerenal azotemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Although this patient is edematous, his clinical state is consistent with\n\nintravascular volume depletion. Hypocalcemia in nephrotic syndrome, in the absence of acute kidney injury, is primarily related to hypoalbuminemia with a decreased fraction of albumin-bound calcium. Total serum calcium is divided into ionized and nonionized fractions, with approximately 50% of total serum calcium being bound to albumin at any given time. Ionized calcium is the physiologically active and hormonally regulated form, and when decreased, this produces the classic clinical findings of hypocalcemia, including tetany, seizures, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Children with nephrotic syndrome who have hypocalcemia do not usually have symptoms because their albumin-bound fraction of calcium is low but their ionized calcium level remains normal. In children with hypoalbuminemia, whether attributable to nephrotic syndrome or another cause, serum ionized calcium should be measured or the corrected calcium level accounting for hypoalbuminemia should be calculated: 2 2 Corrected Ca + = Measured Total Ca + + 0.8 × (normal albumin − patient albumin) For the patient in the vignette, assuming a normal serum albumin level of 4 g/dL, the calculation would appear as follows: 2 Corrected Ca + = 7.1 mg/dL + 0.8 × (4 g/dL − 1.2 g/dL) = 9.34 mg/dL Although hypoalbuminemia can produce a pseudohypocalcemia, children with nephrotic syndrome who have frequent relapses or prolonged periods of nephrosis may be at risk for true hypocalcemia from altered mineral and vitamin D metabolism. Glucocorticoids suppress new bone formation and can enhance urinary calcium excretion. Urinary losses of vitamin D–binding protein, responsible for transporting most of the vitamin D and its metabolites in circulation, may lead to vitamin D deficiency that produces hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and decreased bone mineral density.\n\nTriglyceride level does not significantly affect serum calcium levels in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Even if this patient had a low serum ionized calcium level, the expected response would be a secondary hyperparathyroidism, not hypoparathyroidism. Hypocalcemia can be associated with hyperphosphatemia, but this patient’s serum phosphorus level is normal for age. Hypoalbuminemia in nephrotic syndrome is associated with other complications as well, including predisposition to edema formation and risk of acute kidney injury through intravascular hypovolemia. Although the mechanisms of edema development in nephrotic syndrome are controversial, the role of urinary albumin loss seen in this condition is central to one theory (the underfill hypothesis). Disruption in Starling forces across the capillary wall, in particular decreased plasma oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia, reduces intravascular volume and promotes fluid accumulation in the interstitial compartment. In contrast, for some patients with nephrotic syndrome, the primary driver for edema may be the sodium and fluid retention that accompanies urinary protein losses, leading to plasma volume expansion with excess fluid entering the interstitial space (the overfill hypothesis). Recent research supporting this has demonstrated that urinary proteases found in patients with nephrotic syndrome can activate the epithelial sodium channel in the distal nephron, enhancing sodium and fluid retention and leading to edema. PREP Pearls Hypocalcemia is a common electrolyte abnormality seen in children with nephrotic syndrome. This condition is related to hypoalbuminemia, with decreased albumin-bound calcium from urinary albumin losses. In longstanding nephrosis, vitamin D deficiency from urinary losses of vitamin D–binding protein may contribute as well. The serum ionized calcium level is typically normal in nephrotic syndrome. The total serum calcium level needs to be corrected for the degree of hypoalbuminemia.\n\nABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area Know the pathogenesis and consequences of hypoalbuminemia in nephrotic syndrome Suggested Readings Ellis D.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has new-onset nephrotic syndrome in the setting of congenitally acquired HIV. He has mild hypertension and a normal creatinine level without evidence of coinfection with hepatitis. The most likely finding on biopsy would be focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). In both the pediatric and adult HIV population, FSGS remains the most common finding on biopsy. HIV infection has been associated with a spectrum of renal disease in both the pediatric and adult population. Children can have acute kidney injury, chronic kidney injury, electrolyte disturbances, tubular dysfunction, proteinuria (from microalbuminuria to nephrotic range proteinuria), and glomerular disease (Table). In adults, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) refers to the collapsing form of FSGS. On the pediatric side, not all children undergo renal biopsy. Therefore, childhood HIVAN can be defined clinically as proteinuria for more than 3 months, enlarged, echogenic kidneys found on renal ultrasonography, and abnormal microscopic examination findings in the urine. The exact prevalence of childhood HIVAN remains unknown. Studies have found that 3% to 31% of children with HIV have proteinuria. There is increasing awareness about HIVAN, which could lead to higher rates of detection, but new antiretroviral medications can also prevent renal disease. There are several factors involved in the pathogenesis of HIVAN. First, infection of kidney epithelial cells by HIV can occur. In animal models, there is\n\nevidence that HIV gene expression is needed for the development of HIVAN. At a cellular level, HIV expression can damage cytokinesis in renal tubular epithelial cells. Second, APOL1 and MYH9 genes are common in those of African descent, and have been linked to an increased risk of HIVAN. The differential diagnosis in this case would be any cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. In adults who are HIV positive, the most classic form of HIVAN would be the collapsing variant of FSGS. However, in children with HIV, the non collapsing type of FSGS tends to be the most common finding. In one cohort of children from Africa living with HIV, 65% of patients had FSGS, with more than 59% with the classic variant. In addition, 10% of patients had HIV- associated immune complex disease, and 8% had minimal change disease. In an adult series of 107 patients from Johns Hopkins, 77% had FSGS, with most having the collapsing variant. Other diagnoses included membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), amyloidosis, diabetic nephropathy, and lupus-like immune complex glomerulonephritis. In childhood HIVAN, changes can be seen throughout the nephron on renal biopsy and include both glomerular and interstitial disease. A kidney biopsy in childhood HIVAN with the collapsing variant classically shows tubuloreticular inclusions in the endothelium with collapse of glomerular capillaries associated with FSGS (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Early in the development of renal disease, mesangial hyperplasia with microcystic tubular dilation can occur. Interstitial inflammation may also be present. Immunofluorescence typically displays no deposits or nonspecific immune complexes. In a few pediatric cases, mesangial proliferative lesions occur secondary to immune complex disease. The most definitive therapy for HIVAN is effective antiretroviral therapy. Therapy should be started in patients if they are not already receiving it. If patients develop renal disease while undergoing treatment, this could possibly indicate a failure of the regimen, and the medications might need to be changed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers can be used in combination with antiretrovirals to help\n\nreduce proteinuria. The role of corticosteroids is unclear and often not recommended. For patients who develop end-stage renal disease, renal transplant is recommended, but fewer data are available on the outcomes in children compared with adults. There is a risk of recurrent disease in the allograft. Patients with HIV after transplant can also have a greater risk of rejection and delayed graft function. There is always the risk of opportunistic infection, but this can be similar to patients without HIV if a patient has a low viral load and adequate CD4 cell count. In general, children have a better prognosis than adults. In the clinical vignette, all options are possible. However, in a child with known HIV, FSGS is the most likely diagnosis. HIV-associated immune complex disease can include lupus-like glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, MPGN, and postinfectious glomerulonephritis. These conditions are overall poorly understood and rarely reported in pediatrics. The patient in the vignette has no features to support these diagnoses and no evidence of gross hematuria or elevated creatinine levels as seen in glomerulonephritis. Measuring complements could further help in diagnosis. Minimal change disease is a good option in an 8-year-old with new-onset nephrotic syndrome but not the primary diagnosis in children who are HIV positive. PREP Pearls Childhood HIV-associated nephropathy is defined clinically by proteinuria for more than 3 months, enlarged, echogenic kidneys on renal ultrasonography, and abnormal urine microscopy findings. In adults, HIV- associated nephropathy refers to the collapsing form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is the most likely diagnosis in a child with HIV-associated nephropathy, with most patients having the classic vs the collapsing variant. The treatment for childhood HIV-associated nephropathy should be a combination of antiretroviral therapy along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers if proteinuria is present.\n\nABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area Know the renal manifestations of HIV infection Know the renal histopathology of HIV infection Know the differential diagnosis of the presentation of HIV‑associated renal disease Know the therapeutic options for HIV‑associated renal disease, including the risks involved in transplantation Suggested Readings Beng H, Rakhmanina N, Moudgil A, et al.

    "explanation": "The early-onset hypertension in the patient in the vignette, who has normal electrolyte levels, low plasma renin activity (PRA), and a high plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio of greater than 30 along with the family history of hypertension that is unresponsive to conventional therapy, fits with a diagnosis of glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism (GRA). This is an inherited form of primary hyperaldosteronism and is the most likely diagnosis in this case. This is unlikely to be acquired primary hyperaldosteronism because of the family history, early presentation, and\n\nonly moderately elevated aldosterone level. Liddle syndrome is characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis along with hyporeninemia, and markedly suppressed plasma aldosterone level. Gordon syndrome, on the other hand, is characterized by hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, with suppression of PRA and a normal or high plasma aldosterone level. The hyporeninemia in this patient does not fit with a diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. The enzyme aldosterone synthase facilitates aldosterone synthesis in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex under the control of angiotensin II, and 11-β-hydroxylase facilitates cortisol synthesis in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex under the control of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The corresponding genes for these enzymes lie side by side on chromosome 8. A chimeric gene results when 2 gene pieces fuse that had become improperly arranged during the crossover event during the first mitotic division, thereby having the promoter element of one gene and the coding region of another (Figure). Glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism results from such unequal crossover, and the hybrid chimeric gene has a promoter element that is ACTH responsive, with coding region of aldosterone synthase, resulting in aldosterone synthesis stimulated by ACTH, independent of sodium balance and renin. In addition, in GRA, 18-oxocortisol and 18- hydroxycortisol are 2 corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity produced in the zona fasciculata from cortisol by aldosterone synthase. This activity results in high levels of circulating mineralocorticoids that activate the mineralocorticoid receptor in the distal nephron, mainly the principal cells in the collecting tubules, thereby increasing reabsorption of sodium through the sodium channels in the apical membrane (ENaC) and potassium secretion into the lumen via the renal outer medullary potassium channels. Aldosterone also increases the number of open ENaC channels as well as the Na-K-ATPase pumps on the basolateral membrane, which provides the energy and further facilitates sodium reabsorption by providing a negative electrochemical gradient in the tubular cell lumen. The increase in reabsorbed sodium, and hence water leads to hypertension that is associated with low PRA.\n\nGlucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with different crossover patterns of the hybrid gene in different pedigrees, hence resulting in variable phenotypic severity within the same family. GRA is characterized clinically by hypertension that presents early in childhood or in adolescence, usually refractory to conventional therapies. GRA is also associated with intracranial aneurysm, which, associated with hypertension, may lead to hemorrhagic strokes. Magnetic resonance angiography screening beginning at puberty is recommended. There may be mild hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, although serum electrolyte levels are usually normal. PRA is low, but plasma aldosterone concentration may be normal. A high ratio of plasma aldosterone to PRA more than 30 (normally less than 20) is diagnostic. Dexamethasone suppression test and increased urinary corticosteroid profiles (high 18- oxocortisol) are additional diagnostic tests. Adrenal imaging and adrenal vein sampling will rule out other types of primary aldosteronism. However, genetic testing for the chimeric gene confirms diagnosis, eliminating the need for such additional tests. Treatment with glucocorticoid (dexamethasone or prednisolone) will suppress ACTH, thereby reducing mineralocorticoid production and hence controlling hypertension. Other treatment alternatives are mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which will counteract the action of increased mineralocorticoids and can be used in combination with the glucocorticoid. ENaC channel blockers (triamterene and amiloride) can also be used as adjunctive therapy. PREP Pearls Inherited monogenic forms of hypertension should be suspected in a child with hypertension with low plasma renin activity. Glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism should be suspected in cases of hypertension, low plasma renin activity, and high aldosterone-to-renin ratio and can be confirmed by genetic testing. Hypertension in glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism is typically unresponsive to conventional therapy and is treated with glucocorticoid\n\ntherapy with or without mineralocorticoid receptor blocker.

The patient is not interested in the visit and does not share much additional history but is willing to be examined and undergo some laboratory tests. On examination, the patient appears well, although a 4.5-kg weight loss is confirmed since the last visit 4 months ago. The heart rate is 92/min and blood pressure is 96/52 mm Hg.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has both weight loss and a hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with high levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the urine. These findings are most consistent with hydrochlorothiazide use. When exploring the cause of a metabolic alkalosis with volume loss, one can aim to differentiate between causes with a low renal chloride loss vs causes with a high renal chloride loss. Extrarenal causes of metabolic alkalosis with volume loss, such as from gastrointestinal losses, would be associated with a low renal chloride metabolic alkalosis. Gastrointestinal salt loss leading to hypovolemia will stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which in turn results in increased reabsorption of sodium throughout the nephron, including through the sodium-hydrogen exchanger. An activated RAAS will also lead to enhanced sodium reabsorption at the cortical collecting duct through the epithelial sodium channel. In exchange for this cation reabsorption, cation secretion occurs through both potassium and hydrogen ion secretion. Ultimately, this effect leads to low levels of sodium and chloride in the urine, with potassium and acid losses in the urine, and a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Given that the patient in the vignette has high sodium and chloride levels in the urine, gastrointestinal causes, such as vomiting or laxative abuse, are excluded. Renal causes of metabolic alkalosis with volume loss, such as from loop diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics, inhibit sodium chloride reabsorption, leading to volume loss from high levels of sodium chloride in the urine.\n\nSimilar to gastrointestinal losses, the resulting hypovolemia will stimulate RAAS, leading to high losses of potassium and acid and a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, such as lisinopril, could impair sodium chloride reabsorption; however, it would not lead to hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis as seen in this patient. PREP Pearls While exploring the cause of a metabolic alkalosis with volume loss, one can aim to differentiate between causes with a low renal chloride loss vs causes with a high renal chloride loss. Extrarenal salt losses, such as with gastrointestinal volume loss, will stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and lead to low levels of sodium chloride in the urine.

    "explanation": "The detection of glucose and other sugars in the urine relies on coupled chemical reactions in which a colorimetric compound (chromogen) is produced. With a routine urinalysis, the enzyme glucose oxidase is impregnated within the square on the dipstick for glucose testing. In the presence of glucose in the urine, this enzyme oxidizes glucose into glucuronic acid, and the reaction also produces hydrogen peroxide. Then the hydrogen\n\nperoxide is used as a substrate in a second chemical reaction that leads to the production of a chromogen. Different commercial urinalysis dipsticks use different chromogens. A glucose oxidase test is not the only test that can detect glucose in the urine. A copper reduction test can detect glucose via its ability to reduce cupric sulfate (CuSO ) into cuprous oxide (Cu O). In this reaction, CuSO starts as a 4 2 4 blue or blue-green color and turns into Cu O, which has a yellow to red color. 2 The copper reduction test is often run as reflex testing in the laboratory when a glucose oxidase test result is negative. In a reduction-oxidation reaction, oxidation is defined as the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain of electrons. A reducing substance is a chemical that donates electrons: it causes another chemical to be reduced but is itself oxidized in the process. Glucose is a reducing substance because it contains chemically accessible oxygen molecules, which are excellent electron donors. However, glucose is not the only substance in the urine that can act as a reducing substance. As chemicals with a low molecular weight, glucose and other sugars should freely pass through the glomerular filter. Although the renal proximal tubule has various transporters to reabsorb glucose, it does not for other sugars, such as galactose. In patients with inborn errors of metabolism, other sugars besides glucose can be produced in significant quantities and end up in the urine. These sugars should not be detected by the glucose oxidase test strip but can be detected by the copper reduction test and will be reported by the laboratory as “reducing substances present.” There are other non sugar chemicals that can show up in the urine and alter copper reduction test results, including β-lactam antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins) and salicylates. Some forms of iodinated intravenous contrast may also interfere with glucose oxidase and copper reduction testing.\n\nIn the vignette, the reducing substances in the urine are most likely attributable to the 2 β-lactam antibiotics that the infant is receiving. As such, the next best management step for the patient is to repeat a urinalysis after he has completed the course of antibiotics. Urine carbohydrate testing can be performed to look for specific sugars that may be present in the urine. It uses a different technique and is not affected by the use of β-lactam antibiotics. Of note, the infant receiving dextrose-containing intravenous fluids should not receive any galactose and should not have any other sugar-based reducing substances in the urine. In addition, all states require newborn screening for more than 30 types of inborn errors of metabolism, including galactosemia, the most common inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism (aside from diabetes) and the most likely to cause symptoms in the newborn period. Although a bolus of intravenous fluids would not be harmful, it would not help to determine the reason why the infant has reducing substances in the urine. Infants with inborn errors of metabolism are at risk of having reducing substances in the urine. Testing for ammonia is appropriate for infants with suspected urea cycle defects or organic acidemias. It would not be the first test in an infant suspected of having reducing substances. PREP Pearls Glucose in the urine can be detected via a glucose oxidase or copper reduction test. In a patient with a negative glucose oxidase test result, a positive copper reduction test result may indicate the presence of reducing substances in the urine, such as galactose and other simple sugars. Antibiotics and salicylates can result in false-positive copper reduction test results.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has red blood cell casts, hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency in the presence of normal complement levels. Complement pathway is an important defense mechanism and is part of the innate immune system. There are 3 different complement pathways: classic pathway, alternate pathway, and mannose-binding collecting pathway. All the 3 pathways convert at C3 convertase and result in downstream production of membrane attack complex, which causes cytolysis. Activation of the complement cascade produces several different complement fragments that act as proinflammatory agents. The ability of the complement pathway to distinguish between host (self) and pathogenic cells is critical and is accomplished by complement regulatory proteins. Thus, when this delicate balance is gone awry with loss of function in complement regulatory proteins or gain-of-function mutations of the complement proteins, host injury occurs in the form of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. In many of the autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, although there is systemic activation of complement, for yet unknown reason, the kidney is particularly vulnerable to complement-mediated injury. Complement activation within the kidney results in glomerular inflammation, glomerular capillary wall injury, and complement deposition. Most commonly measured complement proteins are C3, C4, AH50, and CH50. These tests have been used to differentiate glomerular diseases and in some instances have been used to monitor disease activity. In addition to serum levels, immune staining of complement protein in a kidney biopsy is used to aid in the diagnosis of glomerular diseases. The concentration of complement proteins depends on production in the liver and systemic/local consumption. Even though the kidney plays a small role in the overall consumption of complement proteins, activation of the complement pathway in the kidney causes significant injury. In general, activation of the classic complement pathway results in low C3 and C4 levels, and activation of an alternate pathway results in low C3 but normal C4 levels. Low complement protein levels are not necessarily specific for glomerulonephritis but can be seen in\n\nother diseases, such as sepsis, HIV infection, pancreatitis, and atheroembolic disease. In addition, decreased production of complement can be seen in liver disease or malnutrition. Complement proteins can be elevated as part of an acute-phase response or in pregnancy. IgA nephropathy is the most common glomerulonephritis seen globally, with the highest incidence in the Pacific Asian regions. Genetic and environmental factors play an important role in the risk of disease occurrence and progression. Patients with IgA nephropathy have circulating and glomerular deposition of immune complexes that consist of galactose-deficient IgA1, IgG autoantibody directed against the hinge region O-glycans, and C3. Galactose- deficient IgA1 levels are elevated in 25% of blood relatives of patients with IgA nephropathy. Studies have found that environmental factors, such as infection, can influence the levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 and thus might act as a triggering factor in the presentation of IgA nephropathy. Clinical presentation of IgA nephropathy can be variable from isolated microscopic hematuria to progressive glomerulonephritis, leading to end-stage renal disease. In general, isolated microscopic hematuria with minimal or no proteinuria is considered a favorable prognostic indicator; however, a proportion of these patients have a risk of developing progressive kidney disease, and thus long-term follow-up is important in these patients. Poor prognostic indicators at presentation include hypertension, proteinuria, and decreased glomerular filtration rate. Although complement deposition is seen on renal biopsy, serum C3 and C4 levels are usually within the normal range. The patient in this vignette does not have a history of fever, heart disease, or skin stigmata indicative of infective endocarditis. Patients with lupus nephritis have classic complement pathway activation, and C3 and C4 levels are depressed in more than 90% of patients with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. In addition, a decrease in C3 and C4 indicates disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis have low C3 but normal C4 levels on laboratory testing, and C3 levels normalize approximately 8 to 12 weeks after presentation.\n\nThus, the most likely cause of the patient’s presentation with nephritic syndrome and normal complement levels is IgA nephropathy. Table 1 and Table 2 list the systemic and renal-specific diseases associated with normal and low serum complement levels. PREP Pearls Patients with IgA nephropathy have normal circulating levels of C3 and C4. Activation of the classic complement pathway causes low C3 and C4 levels and is seen in lupus nephritis. Activation of the alternate complement pathway results in low C3 but normal C4 levels as seein in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.

    "explanation": "The child in the vignette is seen with recurrent episodes of epistaxis and bruising, which is concerning for a possible bleeding diathesis. His initial laboratory study findings are notable for anemia and profound kidney dysfunction. Given his short stature and the presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, his kidney disease is most likely chronic in nature. The normal platelet count argues against decreased production of platelets, such as in bone marrow failure states, or increased destruction of platelets, as in\n\nimmune thrombocytopenic purpura or the thrombotic microangiopathies. His normal prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time suggest that proteins involved in the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways are quantitatively intact, respectively. On the basis of the information presented and his clinical features of uremia, his bleeding symptoms are most likely related to a qualitative defect in platelet function. The most likely cause is impaired platelet aggregation from uremia-induced dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Uremia, literally urine in the blood, is a condition of biochemical and physiologic derangements that accompanies severe kidney dysfunction as a result of impaired clearance of waste products. Uremia is common in children with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) but may also be seen in some children with acute kidney injury, depending on the duration and severity of injury. Although blood urea is one such example of a solute that exhibits toxic metabolic effects at sufficient concentrations, it is only one of many uremic toxins present with advanced kidney disease. Uremic toxins can be classified by their chemical and physical properties into 3 groups: 1. Small water-soluble molecules (eg, urea) 2. Small protein-bound molecules (eg, indoxyl sulfate) 3. Middle-weight molecules (eg, β -microglobulin) 2 Small water-soluble molecules have a molecular weight less than 500 Da and have minimal if any protein-binding capacity. Examples include urea, guanidines, and methylamines. Urea was traditionally believed to be biologically inert; however, experimental studies have found that it has a host of toxic effects, including promotion of free radical production, cellular apoptosis, and molecular changes responsible for insulin resistance. Urea additionally generates cyanate carbamylation compounds, which contribute to atherogenesis. Guanidines, structural metabolites of arginine, were first studied as a cause of uremic neurotoxicity but have since been found to play\n\na role in other key biologic functions, including inflammation, suppression of osteoblast calcification and calcitriol synthesis, and inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Decreased NO production is proposed to be the key toxic effect of guanidines in end-stage kidney disease, promoting immune dysfunction, vasoconstriction, and neurologic sequelae. Methylamines have been primarily associated with atherosclerosis and inhibition of renal secretion of drugs by inhibiting the organic cation transporter 2. Trimethylamine N-oxide in particular has been associated with cardiovascular disease in the general population and in patients with CKD and may also contribute to CKD progression. Small protein-bound molecules, unlike the water-soluble uremic toxins previously mentioned, are difficult to remove by dialysis because of their protein-binding capabilities. Examples include indoles (eg, indoxyl sulfate) and homocysteine. Indoles are produced by gut bacteria through metabolism of tryptophan and in sufficient concentrations through experimental studies cam promote glomerular sclerosis, endothelial cell dysfunction, and atherosclerosis. Homocysteine, a demethylated metabolite of the amino acid methionine, increases proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Although observational studies have found that homocysteine levels in patients with CKD are 2- to 4-fold higher than in healthy individuals, dietary factors (eg, nutrition, folic acid intake) and genetics may also affect serum concentration. Middle-weight molecules, arbitrarily designated as larger than 500 Da, are still small enough to be filtered by the glomerulus (<59,000 Da). Most of these proteins and peptides have a molecular size that exceeds 10,000 Da, which makes their clearance by dialysis require a membrane with a large pore size (eg, high-flux dialyzers). β -microglobulin, the prototype in this group, has 2 been associated with cognitive decline and proaging activity and is the primary substance found in dialysis-related amyloid.\n\nUremic toxins are believed to contribute to a bleeding diathesis in advanced CKD through several mechanisms that affect platelet function and formation of the primary clot. Specific toxins that interfere with hemostasis include urea, creatinine, guanidines (eg, guanidinosuccinic acid, methylguanidine), and phenolic acid. Platelets in patients with uremia typically have a normal number of glycoprotein IIa/IIIb surface receptors, which are necessary for platelet aggregation. However, in the uremic milieu, there is a conformational change in this glycoprotein, impairing its ability to bind von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen. PREP Pearls Bleeding risk in patients with uremia, although multifactorial, is commonly attributed to defective platelet aggregation as a result of dysfunctional glycoprotein IIa/IIIb binding to von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen. Uremic toxins accumulate with progression of chronic kidney disease, negatively affecting a variety of biochemical pathways and physiologic processes in multiple organ systems. Uremic toxins can be grouped based on molecular weight, protein- binding ability, and ease of which they are cleared by dialysis.

    "explanation": "Oligomeganephronia is a form of renal hypoplasia with small kidneys, usually bilateral. Histology typically shows a reduced number of nephrons and hypertrophy of glomeruli and tubules, and would be the most likely kidney histology to be seen in the vignette. These findings are associated with hypertension when the hypoplasia is segmental, a condition known as Ask- Upmark kidneys. Thyroidization (colloid casts) is a manifestation of chronic inflammation and is more compatible with chronic pyelonephritis and development of renal scars. While patients with these conditions may display hypertension, the child in the vignette did not have a history of urinary tract infections or urinary abnormalities, and the kidney ultrasound did not reveal scars. Large cysts with fibrotic parenchyma and flattened cuboidal epithelium are seen in multicystic dysplastic kidneys, not seen in this child’s kidney ultrasound. Tubular dilatation, tubular casts, and thinning of the brush border is seen in patients with acute tubular necrosis, which is unlikely in this vignette with a normal serum creatinine. In 1929, Eric Ask-Upmark described a distinct kidney abnormality known as “segmental hypoplasia” in a group of children and adolescents seen with significant hypertension. The kidney is often congenitally small, and histologic description includes decreased number of pyramids, atrophic tubules, absent or few glomeruli, and thin cortex with distinctive groove on the capsular surface denoting the hypoplastic segment. Proposed pathogenesis includes developmental arrest or possible congenital defect in renal vasculature leading to segmental hypoplasia. Angiographic studies demonstrated a uniformly small renal artery without evidence of stenosis. Other investigators proposed that this may be a form of embryo fetopathy resulting from an intrauterine insult and not developmental arrest. Hypertension can be\n\nexplained by the elevated renin levels found in the surrounding normal kidney tissue; however, this finding is not consistent. In more recent studies, it has been proposed that this may be a variant of a renal scar because vesicoureteral reflux has been reported in 70% to 80% of children with segmental hypoplasia. In some cases, segmental resection of the hypoplastic area leads to the resolution of hypertension. In 1962, Ljungvist and Lagergen reported only 3 cases of Ask-Upmark kidneys of 1,000 autopsies and 100 nephrectomies. The kidneys were small and histologically different from chronic pyelonephritis or atrophic segmentation secondary to vascular anomalies. The segmental changes can be in the cortex or medulla. A relative lack of glomeruli in the cortex is characteristic of segmental hypoplasia and not of chronic pyelonephritis. PREP Pearls Ask-Upmark kidney is a form of segmental hypoplasia usually associated with hypertension in childhood and adolescence. Histologically different from chronic pyelonephritis scar, Ask-Upmark kidney has absent or few glomeruli, small number of pyramids, and atrophic tubules separated by a thin groove from normal kidney tissue.

On day 3, he noticed that his arms started to feel sore, and by day 4, the soreness felt disproportionate to what he was accustomed to, and he was unable to extend his arms fully.

    "explanation": "The evaluation of the urine for blood is a common screening test performed in a variety of clinical scenarios. Urinalysis reagent strips do not detect red blood cells per se but instead use the peroxidase activity of the heme moiety\n\nwithin hemoglobin to convert tetramethylbenzidine into a blue-green chromogen. A heme-positive urine sample may contain red blood cells (which can be confirmed through microscopic analysis), or the urine sample may contain pigments that also have peroxidase activity. The 2 most common pigments are free hemoglobin, which can be present in the urine as a result of intravascular hemolysis, and myoglobin, which can be present in the urine as a result of rhabdomyolysis. In both cases, an individual with pigmenturia is at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) because both the free hemoglobin and myoglobin are freely filtered by the glomerulus. Within the tubular lumen, these proteins are oxidized and release the free heme, which contributes to tubular cell injury through a variety of mechanisms, including vasoconstriction, formation of plugs within the tubular lumen, oxidative stress, and activation of inflammatory processes. The patient in the vignette has exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis. The preferred next step in this patient’s treatment is intravenous hydration with normal saline. Often patients with exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis will have brown urine, although this patient did not. He had heme-positive urine that did not have any red blood cells present on microscopy. He presented with a significantly elevated creatine kinase (CK) level, which is often used as a surrogate for urine myoglobin because the CK assay is fast and reliable, whereas myoglobin testing is often delayed and has high false-negative rates. A CK level greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (approximately 1,000 U/L) is diagnostic of rhabdomyolysis; however, it is not uncommon to see CK levels in excess of 10,000 U/L, and levels greater than 100,000 U/L can be seen with severe cases. In a patient with pigmenturia, the mainstay of treatment is high-volume intravenous fluids. The goal with these fluids is to produce a high urine output that helps to flush out any free heme pigments to decrease the chance that these pigments can cause tubular obstruction and AKI. Patients often receive 0.9% normal saline. Studies in animals have suggested a role for urinary alkalinization; however, alkalinization of intravenous fluids has not been definitely shown to be effective in humans.\n\nIn the patient in the vignette, the use of sodium bicarbonate in his intravenous fluids would not be indicated because his urinalysis shows a neutral pH 7 and his chemistry panel shows a serum bicarbonate of 29 mEq/L (29 mmol/L). Observation alone would not be appropriate because of the risk of AKI given that his CK level is already 25 times the upper limit of normal and his muscle injury only occurred within the past 2 days. Increased oral hydration is appropriate for the recovery stages of rhabdomyolysis. It is not appropriate in the initial stages of treatment. PREP Pearls Free hemoglobin and myoglobin cause heme-positive urinalysis results in the absence of red blood cells in the urine. Patients with pigmenturia are at high risk of developing acute kidney injury. Intravenous fluids are the mainstay of treatment for patients with rhabdomyolysis.

In the vignette, the chi-square test (X ) should be used because the data are categorical (binary and nominal) and there are 2 or more independent groups. The most frequent example is a 2 × 2 table comparing 2 or more groups. If the sample size is small and the expected frequency (not observed frequency) is 2 or less, then the Fisher exact test rather than the chi square is more appropriate.\n\nThe Mann-Whitney U test also known as Wilcoxon rank test uses data that are nonlinear and ranks the data in order of occurrence. This test is not used for categorical data. An example would be comparing the 2-year posttransplant chronic kidney disease stage from 2 groups of patients with different induction regimens. One of the most frequently used parametric statistical tests is the Student t- test, which is used to determine whether the mean of 2 groups are different from each other. The t-test is used for continuous data and assumes a normal distribution of values. The t-test uses the mean, standard deviation, and number of samples in each group. An example would be comparing the 2-year posttransplant estimated glomerular filtration rates from 2 groups of patients with different induction regimens (if normally distributed). 2 X test will show if there is a difference between the observed frequency from the expected frequency as shown in the formula below: 2 2 X = sum of (observed-expected number of individuals in cell) expected number of individuals in cell or 2 x2 = ∑ (O-E) E The null hypothesis is that the chosen variables are independent of each other. If the calculated observed frequency is higher than expected frequency, then the null hypothesis is rejected, and a dependent relationship is established between the categorical variables. In the vignette, if the observed frequency of influenza is higher than expected frequency, then the proposed hypothesis that influenza vaccination is associated with a lower prevalence of influenza in the chosen groups is accepted.

Blood pressure is measured in all 4 extremities and is elevated in all 4 extremities, although the infant is crying during measurement and unable to be consoled. In the upper extremities, systolic blood pressure is in the 120- to 130-mm Hg range, and in the lower extremities, systolic blood pressure is in the 100- to 110- mm Hg range.

    "explanation": "The infant in the vignette has a number of signs and symptoms concerning for a coarctation of the aorta (CoA). CoA is screened for in the newborn nursery by comparing the upper-extremity peripheral oxygenation saturation with that of the lower extremities. In the setting of a significant CoA, a\n\nneonate may have a right-to-left shunt via the ductus arteriosus, leading to deoxygenated blood in the postductal circulation. This condition occurs in severe obstruction when there would otherwise be significantly reduced perfusion pressure in the postductal aorta. In milder forms of CoA, however, this condition may go undetected. In these cases, the diagnosis is most often made related to impacts on renal blood flow. Because there is impaired renal blood flow distal to the coarctation, stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system occurs. The resulting systemic vasoconstriction and sodium reabsorption serve to increase circulating volume and blood pressure to the otherwise poorly perfused kidneys, which leads to often severe hypertension proximal to the coarctation. In addition, stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system enhances potassium and acid secretion from the distal nephron. Therefore, the presence of hypokalemia would be consistent with a diagnosis of CoA. Even though there is enhanced sodium reabsorption, this finding would be accompanied by water reabsorption and would not be expected to lead to hypernatremia; rather, it would lead to hypervolemia and hypertension proximal to the coarctation. Similarly, because the patient’s circulating volume status proximal to the coarctation is elevated rather than reduced, a volume- induced stimulation of antidiuretic hormone or other mechanisms that would lead to hyponatremia is not anticipated. Lastly, as noted above, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is associated with increased acid secretion from the distal nephron, so metabolic alkalosis rather than hyperchloremic acidosis would be more consistent with a diagnosis of CoA. PREP Pearls In the setting of a significant coarctation, a neonate may have a right-to- left shunt via the ductus arteriosus, leading to deoxygenated blood in the postductal circulation and decreased lower-extremity oxygenation saturation compared with the upper extremity. Impaired renal blood flow distal to the coarctation leads to stimulation of\n\nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, systemic vasoconstriction, and sodium reabsorption, resulting in often severe hypertension proximal to the coarctation.

    "explanation": "This patient with neurogenic bladder and history of recurrent urinary tract infections has features of pyelonephritis (eg, fever, flank pain, and pyuria) with a staghorn calculus in the left renal pelvis. The alkaline urine level with coffin-lid shaped crystals is suggestive of a struvite stone. Struvite stones are composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium carbonate apatite. Struvite stones typically develop in the context of urinary tract infection (UTI) with urease-producing bacteria such as Proteus spp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp, Morganella morganni, and Providencia spp. Urease causes urinary urea to break down into ammonia and carbon dioxide. Ammonia then combines with water to form ammonium and hydroxide, resulting in an alkaline urine. In the setting of high urine pH, phosphate solubility is decreased. Ammonium combines with magnesium, phosphate, and water to create magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) stones. Ammonia also causes damage to the glycosaminoglycan layer of the urothelium, allowing bacteria to attach and form a biofilm. Carbon dioxide formed by urease combines with water to form bicarbonate and then carbonate. Carbonate combines with calcium and phosphate to form calcium carbonate apatite. Struvite stones can be mixed with calcium oxalate. These stones typically begin as a calcium oxalate stone with secondary infection leading to struvite accumulation. Struvite stones occur more commonly in females. They are relatively uncommon in children. Struvite stones are most commonly seen in patients with neurogenic bladder, indwelling urinary catheters, or urinary diversion. Struvite stones are typically diagnosed in the setting of UTI symptoms. They can also present with flank pain, abdominal pain, or gross hematuria. The urine is typically alkaline with pH >8, and magnesium ammonium phosphate crystals may be seen on microscopy (coffin-lid appearance). Struvite stones are usually radiopaque due to the calcium component and can be visualized\n\non plain radiographs, ultrasound, and computed tomography scan. Noncontrast computed tomography scan is usually recommended for diagnosis and surgical planning. Struvite stones often grow rapidly and can progress into staghorn calculi that fill the renal pelvis and calyces. Untreated struvite stones can lead to kidney damage and sepsis. Struvite stones, especially if they have developed into a staghorn calculus, rarely pass spontaneously. Medical therapy is not usually effective in treating struvite stones and is not recommended as first-line therapy. Surgical intervention is required for definitive management. Surgical options included percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL), shock-wave lithotripsy (SWL), open surgical anatrophic nephrolithotomy (ANL), and laparoscopic or robotic ANL. Complete stone removal is recommended, because the presence of residual stone fragments increases the risk of stone recurrence. According to American Urological Association guidelines, PNL monotherapy is first-line management for struvite straghorn calculi. Stone-free rates are reported as 80% to 90% after PNL monotherapy. Ureteroscopy is sometimes performed in conjunction with PNL to remove stone fragments. Open surgical excision used to be considered the gold standard for staghorn calculi, with stone-free rates of 80% to 100%. However, open surgical ANL is rarely performed today because PNL has similar stone-free rates with lower risk of complications. Laparoscopic or robotic ANL is also not typically recommended first-line given lower stone-free rates than PNL. Shock-wave lithotripsy is not recommended alone for struvite staghorn stones due to inferior stone-free rates compared with PNL. Shock-wave lithotripsy may be considered in patients with small stones and no hydroureteronephrosis. Shock-wave lithotripsy can be combined with PNL if stones are large or if all stone fragments are not accessible by PNL. Complications of surgical removal of struvite stones include perforation of the renal pelvis, sepsis, perinephric hematoma, blood loss, and urinoma. Complication rate is lowest for PNL and highest for open ANL.\n\nMedical therapy may be considered as adjunctive treatment to limit the growth of struvite stones or to prevent recurrent stones. Antibiotic therapy to eradicate urease-producing bacteria may prevent recurrent struvite stones, but antibiotics do not penetrate into an existing infection stone. Because struvite stones occur at high urine pH, acidification of the urine to less than 6.5 can increase the solubility of these stones. Therapies to acidify the urine, including ascorbic acid, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrite, and L-methionine, have been reported, but these are rarely used in clinical practice. Acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) is a urease inhibitor that achieves high urinary concentration and can penetrate bacterial cell walls. Randomized controlled trials of AHA have shown reduction in stone growth but no effect on decreasing existing stone burden. Significant side effects are reported in 20% to 60% of patients taking AHA, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, rash, palpitations, and anemia. Urease inhibitors are rarely used due to high rates of adverse effects. Acetohydroxamic acid can be considered after surgical intervention for patients with residual struvite stone fragments or recurrent struvite stones. PREP Pearls Struvite stones are composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium carbonate apatite and typically develop in the context of urinary tract infection with urease-producing bacteria in patients with neurogenic bladder or urinary diversion. Struvite stones can develop into staghorn calculi, which rarely pass spontaneously and require surgical intervention.

The most appropriate long-term management after kidney transplant in such patients is to continue treatment with oral cysteamine and cysteamine eye drops. Cystinosis is a rare disease that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Cystinosis is caused by mutations in the CTNS gene, which encodes for the cystine transporter cystinosin. In the absence of cystinosin, patients with cystinosis have accumulation of lysosomal cystine. Three different clinical forms of cystinosis have been described: infantile, juvenile, and adult or ocular cystinosis. The infantile form or early-onset nephropathic cystinosis is the most severe and the most common form, accounting for approximately 95% of cases. Patients usually are seen with renal Fanconi syndrome within the first year after birth, and without appropriate treatment, patients develop end-stage kidney disease by 10 to 12 years of age. The age at disease onset in juvenile or late-onset nephropathic cystinosis is around the time of adolescence. Ocular or non-nephropathic cystinosis is characterized only by corneal crystals. Accumulation and crystallization of cystine occur in lysosomes of all organs, resulting in tissue damage. Proximal tubules are affected early in the disease, resulting in the presentation of Fanconi syndrome. Extrarenal complications develop in several organs, including thyroid, eyes, muscle, brain, bones, lungs, gonads, and pancreas. Therefore, early diagnosis and initiation of treatment are critical in preventing multiorgan dysfunction and in improving overall prognosis. Cysteamine is currently the treatment of choice to decrease lysosomal cystine accumulation. Cysteamine enters the lysosome via an unknown transporter and causes breakdown of cystine into cysteamine-cysteine disulfide complexes and cysteine, which are removed from the lysosome via a lysine/arginine transporter (PQLC2) and cysteine transporter, respectively. Cysteamine delays progression to end-stage kidney disease. Challenges to\n\nmedication adherence include unpleasant body and breath odor, pill burden, and adverse effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms, neutropenia, and allergic rashes, among others. Orally administered cysteamine does not enter the cornea; therefore, cysteamine eye drops should be used to dissolve corneal crystals. These eye drops must be applied multiple times a day, which also decreases medication adherence. Long-term studies have found that early initiation and strict adherence to therapy improve life expectancy and extrarenal outcomes in these patients with cystinosis. Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage kidney disease and cystinosis. After kidney transplant, proximal tubular disease does not recur because the grafted kidney has normal expression of cystinosin. Although over time cystine crystals have been shown to accumulate in the interstitium of the graft, this accumulation is without clinical or biochemical phenotype. On the contrary, cystine will continue to accumulate in other organs; therefore, the use of oral cysteamine and cysteamine eye drops should be continued lifelong. Although studies have found that patients with cystinosis have better long-term kidney graft survival compared with patients with end-stage kidney disease from other causes. Immunosuppressive regimens are comparable between patients with cystinosis and without cystinosis. The risk of diabetes can be higher in patients with cystinosis, especially in those taking corticosteroids and tacrolimus; thus, close monitoring is required. PREP Pearls Cystinosis is a rare disease caused by mutations in the CTNS gene, which encodes for the cystine transporter cystinosin. In the absence of the transporter, cystine accumulates in the lysosomes of all organs. Oral cysteamine decreases cystine accumulation in the lysosomes. Similarly, cysteamine eye drops dissolve cystine crystals in the eyes. Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with cystinosis and end-stage kidney disease. The use of cysteamine both orally and topically in the eyes should be continued after kidney transplant.\n\nABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area Know the natural history of cystinosis following renal transplantation Suggested Readings Ariceta G, Giordano V, Santos F.

She was in a motor vehicle crash the day prior and had bilateral femur fractures and a grade 3 laceration of her left kidney. On arrival at the hospital the day before, her heart rate was 130 beats/min, and her blood pressure was 76/42 mm Hg. She received three 1-L boluses of normal saline. During the night, she also received 2 units of packed red blood cells and was given nothing by mouth. She received 150 mL/h of normal saline. She has central venous access, and this morning was ordered to receive total parenteral nutrition. Her pain is controlled with a fentanyl infusion. This morning her respiratory effort has increased, although her oxygen saturation remains 98% on room air. Her heart rate is 100 beats/min and blood pressure is 80/50s mm Hg. The intensivist notes that her fluid balance includes an intake of 6 L and only 750 mL of urine output. Her serum electrolyte levels are all normal.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has acute kidney injury. Although with 750 mL of urine output she does not technically have oliguria, her urine output is considerably inadequate compared with her 6 L of fluid intake. If her kidney injury and urine output do not improve, she is at risk for worsening fluid overload and its related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this patient’s management is to concentrate total parenteral nutrition and necessary intravenous medications. Fluid overload has been associated with poor outcomes in a number of critically ill settings, including general pediatric intensive care unit patients and surgical patients, such as the one in the vignette. Most importantly, fluid overload in these settings is associated with greater mortality independently of other clinical factors and illness severity ratings. In many of these studies, fluid overload is also associated with increased hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, prolonged duration of acute kidney injury, and increased duration of mechanical ventilatory support. Of note, one study, the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) study, randomized 3,141 children with severe febrile illness and impaired perfusion to 1 of 3 fluid resuscitation strategies: a 5% albumin group, a normal saline group, and a no bolus group. The authors found that either 5% albumin or normal saline increased mortality when these critically ill children had signs of impaired perfusion. This trial was met with controversy because many other studies have demonstrated the importance of fluid resuscitation early in the management of critically ill children. Even so, the study suggests that there seems to also be a point where ongoing fluid resuscitation may be causing harm rather than benefit. The patient in the vignette appears to have\n\nreached this point because she has received 6 L of fluid intake with only a small improvement in her hemodynamics. However, in the context of major surgery or trauma, patients may continue to have third space fluid for up to 72 hours, so she will need frequent reappraisal of her hemodynamic and respiratory status in the context of evolving acute kidney injury. Treatment of fluid overload in the setting of acute kidney injury should begin with fluid restrictions, especially when the disease process causing the fluid overload is considered time limited. Diuretics warrant consideration but are not without risk and have never been demonstrated to improve outcomes. In this patient with ongoing hypotension and signs of decreased circulating volume, diuretics may not be effective and may worsen the patient’s effective circulating volume. Therefore, if used, management should begin with a single large dose of a loop diuretic to assess its effectiveness and the patient's ability to tolerate the diuretics before starting a diuretic infusion. If this patient’s acute kidney injury were to continue or worsen and her fluid overload to persist or worsen, then renal replacement therapy, preferably a form of continuous renal replacement therapy, would be indicated. However, the patient has not clearly reached this point yet and may respond to management of her underlying condition, fluid restriction, with or without a diuretic trial. PREP Pearls Fluid overload has been associated with poor outcomes in a number of critically ill settings, including increased morbidity (eg, increased hospital length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation) and mortality. Treatment of fluid overload in the setting of acute kidney injury should begin with fluid restrictions and may include a trial of a single high-dose loop diuretic. Continuous renal replacement therapy should be considered if fluid overload persists or worsens despite appropriate fluid restrictions and a diuretic trial or if intake requirements, such as for nutrition or transfusions, exceed restriction goals.\n\nABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area Calculate the appropriate fluid therapy for a patient with acute kidney injury with or without oliguria Understand that fluid is a drug and may affect morbidity and mortality in acute kidney injury Evaluate the clinical course and adequacy of fluid therapy for a patient with oliguria Suggested Readings Maitland K, Kiguli S, Opoka RO, et al; FEAST Trial Group.

    "explanation": "Nephrotoxicity is an important complication of chemotherapy conventionally used to treat different types of cancer, thereby limiting treatment efficacy and increasing morbidity as well as mortality. The Childhood Cancer Survivor\n\nStudy reported that significant kidney involvement is present in approximately 0.5% to 0.8% of long-term survivors (follow-up period >5 years) compared with approximately 0.2% in their siblings (relative risk, 8.1). Chemotherapeutic agents may affect any nephron segment, vasculature, tubules, glomerulus, or the interstitial compartment of the kidney. Drug- induced acute kidney injury (AKI) may be secondary to tubular necrosis, crystalline nephropathy, Fanconi syndrome, electrolyte disturbances, interstitial nephritis, or thrombotic microangiopathy and may be irreversible or lead to various stages of chronic kidney disease. In addition to the innate drug toxicity, renal handling of the drug and certain host factors contribute to the development of AKI, particularly states of hypovolemia, concomitant use of other nephrotoxic agents (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, certain antibiotics, or use of radiographic contrast media), or when associated with underlying renal insufficiency at baseline. The degree of nephrotoxicity also varies with the heterogeneity of the underlying disease, age of the patient, and prior treatment received. Assessing baseline renal function accurately and adjusting dose accordingly, identifying and minimizing the risk factors (eg, maintaining adequate hydration and avoiding use of other nephrotoxic agents) as much as possible before chemotherapy, and vigilant monitoring of the patient afterward will reduce the development and severity of nephrotoxicity with discontinued use or dose reduction of the offending agent for optimal renal recovery. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that is associated with bone marrow suppression, alopecia, infertility, pulmonary fibrosis, and carcinogenesis, particularly when multiple high doses are used over prolonged periods. Acute hemorrhagic cystitis is a known complication, typically occurring 1 to 2 days after a dose of cyclophosphamide, although late occurrence after a month has also been reported. Acrolein, a product of cyclophosphamide metabolism, has direct toxic effect on bladder mucosa, leading to cystitis, with cystoscopy revealing hyperemic bladder wall with actively bleeding petechial spots. Symptoms usually subside within a few days, and no active treatment is required in mild cases; however, more severe cases can last for\n\nmuch longer, requiring active intervention, such as cauterization or cryosurgery. Hyperhydration, bladder irrigation, and frequent voiding are measures taken to decrease the time of contact of acrolein with bladder mucosa. 2-Mercapto-ethane sulfone sodium (MESNA) binds with acrolein, thereby reducing toxicity, and is used for prophylaxis. Other bladder complications of cyclophosphamide therapy include bladder fibrosis and cancer. Ongoing vigilance for bladder cancer is recommended in patients with hemorrhagic cystitis. The patient in the vignette has cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis. Cyclophosphamide therapy has also been associated with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), especially in those receiving high doses intravenously, leading to hyponatremia, as seen in the patient in this vignette. Hyponatremia is less common with oral therapy. Hyponatremia tends to occur more in the setting of fluid overload, which is often seen in these patients. To prevent hemorrhagic cystitis, isotonic saline is used instead of hypotonic saline. Typically, hyponatremia occurs acutely and resolves within 1 to 2 days or after discontinued use of the drug. Dose reduction is strongly recommended to prevent these complications in patients with renal dysfunction. Methotrexate is nephrotoxic, especially with underlying renal insufficiency. High-dose intravenous methotrexate causes tubular injury by precipitating in the renal tubules, leading to crystalline nephropathy, especially in dehydrated patients who are excreting acidic urine. Methotrexate can also cause arteriolar constriction, leading to functional renal impairment with a transient reduction in glomerular filtration rate that recovers within several hours of discontinued use of the drug. Methotrexate can also be associated with SIADH as well as myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxic effects. The patient in the vignette, however, received intrathecal methotrexate, which can cause neurologic adverse effects, such as headaches, dizziness, blurry vision, or loss of balance for a few hours after administration, but does not cause the systemic adverse effects seen with intravenous administration.\n\nDaunorubicin is usually not associated with nephrotoxicity but is known to be associated with myocardial toxicity that can occur months to years after therapy and bone marrow suppression. Drug dose should be reduced in patients with preexisting impaired renal function. Vincristine and other vinca alkaloids are metabolized by the liver, and very little drug can be recovered in the urine. Dose reduction is not required in patients with renal insufficiency but may be required if the patient is undergoing dialysis. Vincristine has been sometimes associated with SIADH, but nephrotoxic effects have not been reported. The patient also received asparaginase, which is not nephrotoxic but has been associated with hypersensitivity or infusion reactions, thromboembolic complications, hyperglycemia, pancreatitis, and hepatotoxicity with hyperbilirubinemia. PREP Pearls Cyclophosphamide is associated with acute hemorrhagic cystitis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and rarely bladder cancer and fibrosis. Intravenous (and not intrathecal) methotrexate is nephrotoxic, leading to crystalline nephropathy and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Daunorubicin and vincristine are not nephrotoxic.

    "explanation": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common in infants. Infants often experience nonspecific symptoms, including fever, vomiting, poor appetite, and decreased energy. As a result, physicians should have a high index of suspicion for UTIs in febrile infants. For the diagnosis, treatment, and management of infants with febrile UTIs, a screening urinalysis can be performed on a bag urine sample or a sample obtained by transurethral catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA).\n\nVarious studies have considered the sensitivity and specificity of elements of a urinalysis for the diagnosis of UTI. In general, a positive test result for leukocyte esterase has good sensitivity for a UTI but only moderate specificity. A positive test result for nitrites has poor sensitivity but high specificity. The presence of bacteria on a Gram stain of an uncentrifuged urine sample has good sensitivity and specificity; however, whether in isolation or combined, elements of a urinalysis alone are not sufficient for the diagnosis of a UTI. A UTI can only be diagnosed via a urine culture from an appropriately collected sample. A urine culture should be obtained only via transurethral catheterization or SPA. While SPA is the ideal standard sample to be used for culture, it requires some technical skill and may not be well received by parents. As such, transurethral catheterization is commonly used. When performed properly, transurethral catheterization has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99%, assuming high bacterial colony counts in the sample. A bacterial colony count greater than 100,000 CFU/mL of a single organism is considered significant for infection. It is appropriate to start empiric treatment with antibiotics based on the clinical assessment of the physician; however, this treatment should only be given after transurethral catheterization or SPA has been performed. Infants with a febrile UTI are at high risk of having predisposing risk factors that may have contributed to the development of the UTI, such as congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract and vesicoureteral reflux. It has been recommended that all infants younger than 24 months presenting with a first febrile UTI have kidney and bladder ultrasonography performed, especially if the kidney and bladder ultrasonography finds any abnormalities suggestive of vesicoureteral reflux or if atypical organisms are identified in the urine culture. In general, voiding cystourethrography can be performed after a recurrent febrile UTI whether or not ultrasonography has any abnormal findings.\n\nIn the vignette, the infant likely has a febrile UTI. Despite the positive urinalysis results, the next best step in the management is to obtain a urine sample via transurethral catheterization or SPA. It is not appropriate to send the bag urine sample for culture because of the high false-positive culture rates with bag samples. Empiric trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy can be started but only after a transurethral catheterization or SPA is performed to obtain a urine sample for culture. Kidney and bladder ultrasonography would be indicated if the urine culture confirms the diagnosis of a febrile UTI. PREP Pearls Urinalysis results can be suggestive of a urinary tract infection but are not diagnostic of a urinary tract infection. A urinary tract infection should be diagnosed by culture on a sample obtained by suprapubic aspiration or transurethral catheterization. All infants younger than 24 months with a febrile urinary tract infection should have kidney and bladder ultrasonography performed with their first febrile urinary tract infection.

    "explanation": "The patient in this vignette has a history of polymyositis, Raynaud phenomenon, arthritis, and edema of the hands and now has nephrotic- range proteinuria and pathologic features of membranous nephropathy. He has a positive antinuclear antibody test result with a speckled pattern but normal serum complements and negative anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies. His clinical presentation is most suggestive of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). The presence of high-titer anti–uridin 1 ribonucleoprotein (U1 RNP) antibodies is a hallmark of MCTD. Mixed connective tissue disease is a systemic autoimmune condition that was initially described in the 1970s as an overlap syndrome with features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), polymyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Mixed connective tissue disease is usually seen in female patients in the second or third decades of life. Although debate remains on whether MCTD is truly a distinct clinical entity, several clinical and laboratory findings favor a diagnosis of MCTD over other connective tissue disorders. The most common clinical features of MCTD include Raynaud phenomenon, swollen hands, polyarthritis, and polymyositis. Patients with\n\nMCTD almost always develop Raynaud phenomenon early in their disease, whereas Raynaud phenomenon occurs in only approximately 25% of patients with classic SLE. Arthritis in MCTD is usually more frequent and severe than in SLE. Pulmonary involvement is a hallmark of MCTD, affecting approximately 75% of patients. Pulmonary manifestations include pulmonary hypertension, pleural effusions, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary vasculitis. Pulmonary hypertension is the leading cause of mortality. Additional clinical features can include esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and cardiac involvement, including conduction abnormalities, pericarditis, and mitral valve prolapse. Sjögren syndrome has been reported in approximately 50% of patients with MCTD, although symptoms of sicca complex are usually less severe than in patients with anti-La (SS-B) antibodies. Many initial diagnoses of MCTD will eventually evolve into another connective tissue disorder. The presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies is highly predictive of evolution into SLE, and the presence of esophageal dysmotility or sclerodactyly is predictive of future SSc. Severe renal disease is rare in patients with MCTD as opposed to those with classic SLE. It has been hypothesized that high titers of anti–U1 RNP antibodies may protect against the development of diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. However, some degree of renal involvement occurs in approximately 25% of patients. Membranous nephropathy is the most common finding. Patients can also develop renal vasculopathy and severe hypertension, similar to what is observed in patients with SSc. Renal amyloidosis has also been described. Glomerular disease in MCTD is typically treated like SLE nephritis, with therapies such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and/or mycophenolate mofetil. The diagnosis of MCTD is dependent on the presence of anti–U1 RNP antibodies. U1 RNP is involved in the splicing of messenger RNA and is composed of 8 polypeptides linked to RNA. Mixed connective tissue disease is specifically associated with anti–U1 RNP antibodies to 1 or more of the following polypeptides: 68-kD, A, and C. The other polypeptides, mainly 28 kDa and 16 kDa, react with anti-Smith antibodies. Both anti–U1 RNP and anti-\n\nSmith antibodies will produce a coarse nuclear speckled antinuclear antibody pattern. Although anti–U1 RNP antibodies can be present in patients with SLE, RA, SSc, and Sjögren syndrome, high-titer anti–U1 RNP antibodies are present in all patients with MCTD. Patients with MCTD also usually have normal or elevated complement levels, negative anti-dsDNA antibodies, and negative anti-Smith antibodies, giving MCTD a distinct serologic profile from classic SLE. Approximately 70% of patients with MCTD will also have a positive rheumatoid factor or antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide. The finding of a positive anti-Smith antibody test result has high specificity for classic SLE as opposed to MCTD. Although it can be difficult to differentiate between SLE and MCTD, a few findings in this vignette are more suggestive of MCTD, including the history of Raynaud phenomenon and polymyositis. The absence of anti-dsDNA antibodies; the lack of immunofluorescence staining for IgA, IgM, and C1q; and the absence of subendothelial immune deposits or tubuloreticular structures in the glomerular endothelial cells also argue against classic SLE. The finding of anti–phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies would be indicative of primary membranous nephropathy. Hepatitis B infection can lead to secondary membranous nephropathy, but infectious causes of membranous nephropathy would not typically be associated with the systemic symptoms described in the vignette. PREP Pearls Mixed connective tissue disease is an overlap syndrome with features of systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and polymyositis. The most common clinical manifestations of mixed connective tissue disease include Raynaud phenomenon, arthritis, puffy hands, polymyositis, and pulmonary disease, and the hallmark laboratory finding is anti–uridin 1 ribonucleoprotein antibodies. Renal disease is less frequent in mixed connective tissue disease than in systemic lupus erythematosus, but the most common manifestation is membranous nephropathy.\n\nABP Content Specifications(s)/Content Area Know the diagnostic tests for mixed connective tissue disease Know the natural history and epidemiology of the renal manifestations of mixed connective tissue disease Know the therapeutic options and complications of treatment for the renal manifestations of mixed connective tissue disease Suggested Readings Cappelli S, Randone SB, Martinovic D, et al. “To be or not to be,” ten years after: Evidence for mixed connective tissue disease as a distinct entity.

    "explanation": "Renal angiomyolipomas (AML) are collections of disordered blood vessels, smooth muscle cells, and fat tissue. They are the most common benign tumor of the kidney. Angiomyolipomas can develop sporadically, although they are\n\ncommonly seen in patients with tuberous sclerosis (TS) complex, in which 80% of patients can develop AML. Angiomyolipomas can exist in 3 subtypes, including classic AMLs that contain fat, fat-poor AMLs, and epithelioid AMLs, which do have a risk of malignancy and metastasis. The major complication of AMLs is the risk of rupture, which can result in massive retroperitoneal hemorrhage and even death. Traditionally, the risk of rupture has been associated with AML size, and a cutoff of 4 cm has been used to distinguish between lesions that are at increased risk of spontaneous rupture. Recent studies have questioned the validity of the 4-cm threshold, as rupture/bleeding has been described in AMLs smaller than 4 cm, and significantly larger lesions can be followed conservatively without any evidence of rupture. It should be noted that most studies of AMLs are retrospective in nature and subject to the biases inherent to this study type. Nonetheless, increases of greater than 0.25 cm per year are concerning and require close follow-up and intervention. Additional risk factors for AML rupture include the presence of aneurysms greater than 5 mm in diameter and having underlying TS. Sporadic AMLs outside of TS appear to be at a lower risk of rupture. Treatment of AMLs includes the use of mTOR inhibitors, such as everolimus, arterial embolization, and nephron-sparing surgery. mTOR inhibitors are most appropriate for patients with TS, and the phase 3 EXIST-1 trial showed that approximately 50% of patients with TS will experience a positive response to the use of everolimus. Arterial embolization can be used both to treat an AML that is actively bleeding and to prevent the development of AML rupture. Arterial embolization offers benefits over nephron-sparing surgery. It is less invasive than surgery, has low complication rates and good outcomes, and preserves overall renal function. Surgery remains the appropriate choice for patients with large AMLs that may not be amenable to embolization techniques.\n\nIn the vignette above, the patient has shown growth of her largest AML over the past 2 years, which has averaged more than 0.25 cm per year. As such, she warrants an intervention. Observation with ultrasonography alone is not the preferred choice. Given her underlying TS diagnosis and the still relatively small size of the AML, the addition of an mTOR inhibitor is the preferred next step. Her AML is asymptomatic and too small to require the use of embolization or nephron-sparing surgery. PREP Pearls mTOR inhibitors are useful agents to treat slowly enlarging angiomyolipomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Angiomyolipomas are the most common benign renal neoplasm. Larger angiomyolipomas and those with internal aneurysms are at an increased risk of spontaneous rupture.

    "explanation": "purpura nephritis)\n\nThe Oxford classification for IgA nephritis was first introduced in 2009 with the aim of identifying renal biopsy features in patients with IgA nephritis that were reproducible, had an independently predicted outcome, and provided prognostic information in addition to prognosis provided by clinical features alone. The initial classification included mesangial hypercellularity (M), segmental glomerulosclerosis (S), and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis (T) and endocapillary hypercellularity (E). These are also labelled as the MEST scores. Mesangial score <0.5 (M0) or >0.5 (M1) Endocapillary hypercellularity absent (E0) or present (E1) Segmental glomerulosclerosis absent (S0) or present (S1) Tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis ≤25% (T0), 26% to 50% (T1), or >50% (T2) Despite the use of the Oxford classification worldwide by clinicians and investigators, evidence suggests inconsistency in reporting of the E (more frequent) and M lesion. In children too, validation studies have reported the value of the MEST scores using univariate analysis. It is important to note that in children, due to shorter follow-up and small numbers of progressive cases, there is a need for greater collaboration to generate larger datasets of patients with IgA nephritis. A recent update from the IgA Nephropathy Classification Working Group, has recommended that a crescent (C) score be added to the original MEST score of the Oxford classification. This recommendation is based on validation studies reporting poor renal outcome if not treated with immunosuppression in patients with a C1 score (crescents in <25% of glomeruli) and poor outcome despite treatment in patients with a C2 score (crescents in >25% of glomeruli). Based on these guidelines, the original MEST score has been updated to a MEST-C score. Additionally the update recommended adding text to indicate presence or absence of podocytopathic features (podocyte hypertrophy/tip lesions) in biopsy specimens with S1.\n\nThe update also evaluated the prognostic significance of the E lesion. In patients with IgA nephritis undergoing repeat renal biopsy, studies have shown that the E lesion is responsive to immunosuppression. Therefore the E score is predictive of outcome only in patients who have not received immunosuppression. The current guidelines also emphasize that current evidence does not support selection of therapy based on E or MEST scores. Light microscopic findings (and not immunofluorescence findings) form the basis of the Oxford Classification. Studies have reported on the poor prognosis in patients with IgG deposits in addition to IgA, and in those with IgA deposits in the mesangium and glomerular capillary wall. However, these do not add to the predictive value of the MEST scores of Oxford classification. Despite similar renal biopsy findings, there is not enough evidence to support the use of Oxford classification/MEST-C scores for patients with IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis). There is also insufficient evidence for the use of these scores in patients with IgA nephritis with repeat kidney biopsy, or in patients with recurrence of IgA nephritis after renal transplant. PREP Pearls Oxford classification for IgA nephritis identifies renal biopsy features in patients with IgA nephritis that provide prognostic information in addition to clinical features alone. Mesangial hypercellularity (M), segmental glomerulosclerosis (S), tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis (T) and endocapillary hypercellularity (E) and crescents are included in the MEST-C score. Oxford classification is for evaluating prognosis in patients with IgA nephritis, and current evidence does not support selection of therapy based on MEST-C scores.

    "explanation": "The patient in the vignette has tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The patient has a hypoattenuated mass, likely to be fat poor, and a biopsy is recommended as the next step. Tuberous sclerosis complex, an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous genetic disorder secondary to inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor genes (TSC1 and TSC2) is characterized by multisystem involvement with typical dermatologic features, hamartomatous lesion in various organs, and other clinical features. Diagnosis is usually made clinically (Table), and genetic testing confirms the diagnosis.\n\nKidneys are frequently involved in TSC and the cause of mortality in many of these patients. The most common renal manifestations are angiomyolipomas (AMLs), renal epithelial cysts (seen in 80% of children by 10 years of age), and, rarely, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in less than 5% of cases. The renal masses in patients with TSC are more commonly AMLs. Angiomyolipomas are benign mesenchymal solid tumors commonly seen in approximately 20% of children younger than 2 years of age with TSC, and by 10 years of age approximately 70% of children have them. Most adults have bilateral AMLs, which often grow larger and are prone to spontaneous hemorrhage. There are 2 histologic types of AML: classic and epithelioid. The classic variety is usually benign, although it can be invasive locally, but the epithelioid variety tends to metastasize. Classic AMLs are typically triphasic, characterized by varying proportions of 3 elements: mature adipose tissue, smooth muscle–like cells (components), and thick-walled, hyalinized, and dysmorphic blood vessels. An abundance of fat within the lesion is critical to establish diagnosis by imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) by identifying imaging features of fat in the tumor, usually identified as a hyperattenuated mass. Fat-poor AMLs are uncommon (approximately 5%), typically hypoattenuated, and cannot be reliably diagnosed by imaging; hence, a renal biopsy is required to establish a diagnosis of classic AML vs the epithelioid variety of AML (AML with epithelial cysts) and to rule out the rare possibility of RCC. Biopsy helps not only in diagnosing RCC but also determining the subtype of RCC for formulating further plans for medical therapy (chemotherapy vs immunotherapy vs other emerging biologic therapies), as well as predicting response. Biopsy specimens of classic AMLs show smooth muscle components by hematoxylin-eosin stain and are positive for human melanosome-associated protein (HMB-45) (Figure 1). HMB-45 recognizes melanocyte protein in the smooth muscle markers in AMLs and is the gold standard for histopathological diagnosis of AMLs. In addition, smooth muscle actin is seen\n\nin classic angiomyolipomas, and these features distinguish them from RCC. Epithelioid AMLs have predominant (>80%) epithelioid histologic features, with round polygonal cells with clear or eosinophilic dense cytoplasm, large hyperchromatic, and sometimes multilobular nucleus, prominent nucleoli, and nuclear inclusion bodies. They are also positive for HMB-45 (Figure 2). Angiomyolipoma with epithelial cysts is a variety of AML characterized by cysts lined by cuboid epithelial cells that originated from the renal tubular epithelium (Figure 3). Renal cell carcinomas are rarely found in TSC, and biopsy is required to establish diagnosis. Renal cell carcinomas show strong immunostaining of nucleus for PAX8 (paired box protein) and of membrane for CAIX (carbonic anhydrase 9), and do not demonstrate HMB-45 staining, which distinguishes them from AMLs. Diffuse immunostaining for cytokeratin 7 is seen in certain subtypes of RCC (angiomyoadenomatous varieties). Papillary RCCs may show vimentin and CD10 staining. Serial ultrasonography is appropriate once the diagnosis of classic AML has been established and RCC ruled out. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors can be used in patients with TSC who have multiple large AMLs that are continuing to grow (>5 mm per year) to reduce volume and decrease risk of progression of AMLs (not appropriate for the patient in the vignette). PREP Pearls Classic angiomyolipomas are typically triphasic, characterized by varying proportions of mature adipose tissue, smooth muscle–like cells, and thick-walled, hyalinized, and dysmorphic blood vessels. Abundance of fat within the lesion is critical to establish diagnosis by imaging usually identified as a hyperattenuated mass. Fat-poor angiomyolipomas are uncommon, are typically hypoattenuated, and cannot be reliably diagnosed by imaging; hence, a renal biopsy is required to establish a diagnosis.

The following requirements should be stated prior to starting a systematic review: (1) Objectives, including eligibility criteria; (2) Explicit and reproducible methodology; (3) Systematic\n\nsearch to identify all studies which meet the eligibility criteria; (4) Assessment of the validity of findings including evaluation of biases and confidence in the data; (5) Systematic presentation of the findings. Typically, a systematic review is often based on randomized clinical trials, but all studies on the topic selected should be included if data are available. Meta-analysis is the integration of statistical analysis on the data obtained in systematic reviews to assess outcomes, evaluate strength of evidence, derive conclusions, and answer the stated aims of the research study. There is an online international portal named International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) in which systematic reviews must be registered to reduce duplication of studies and to document methodological procedures before the review is started. In order to standardize and improve systematic reviews and meta-analysis reporting, the Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) statement and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P) statement were published. PRISMA-P is a checklist which contains 17 items that should be included in every systematic review and meta-analysis publication (title, registration, authors, amendments, support, rationale, objectives, eligibility criteria, information sources, search strategy, study records [including data management], selection process, data collection process, data items, outcomes and prioritization, risk of bias in individual studies, data synthesis, meta-biases, and confidence in cumulative evidence). In the vignette, in order to avoid selection bias, a minimum of 2 independent reviewers must conduct the reviews of all eligible studies and perform the data abstraction. Sometimes, a third reviewer is necessary to break a tie when there is conflict in data interpretation. The aims and objectives of the study must be established prior to the start of data collection and must not be changed during the study period. Due to issues of publication bias, all published and unpublished studies should be included if possible, and any missing data must be obtained if available from the authors.\n\nThere are several issues which can arise when doing systematic reviews and meta-analysis, including data heterogeneity, missing data, differences in methodology, poor study design, and presence of bias. Publication bias may skew the results of the study because positive results are always published, whereas negative results may not be included. Large sample size trials may negate the effects of small size studies. PREP Pearls Systematic reviews can consolidate health reported outcomes from a large number of independent clinical studies.

    "explanation": "According to an international expert consensus panel, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) constitutes metabolic abnormalities that result from the rapid release of intracellular metabolites, leading to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia, with or without hypocalcaemia and uremia. Electrolyte abnormalities associated with TLS can lead to acute kidney injury, arrhythmias, seizures, and death. In children, TLS is most frequently associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (particularly Burkitt lymphoma or leukemia) and hematologic malignant tumors (acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia) spontaneously or within 12 to 72 hours of initiating chemotherapy.\n\nThe patient in the vignette has clinical features indicative of malignant tumors with TLS (hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and acute kidney injury). Risk stratification proposed by the consensus panel incorporates histologic diagnosis, extent, and bulk of disease (stage, lactate dehydrogenase, bulk), use of specific cytotoxic agents, age at diagnosis, and preexisting renal dysfunction or renal involvement as major risk factors for TLS (Table). Renal involvement from the malignant tumor or risk for renal injury leads to higher risk stratification because of the increased risk of TLS. The patient in the vignette is at high risk for tumor lysis (Burkitt lymphoma, acute kidney injury with volume overload). Management of TLS is aimed at maintaining high urinary flow rates with intravenous hydration, uric acid– lowering therapies, and management of life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities. In this patient with TLS, indications for renal replacement therapy are similar to other patients with acute kidney injury. However, a lower threshold should be considered in patients with TLS because of potentially rapid potassium release and accumulation, particularly in patients with oliguria with or without volume overload. In this patient, hemodialysis is the treatment of choice for management of hyperkalemia and hyperuricemia. Intravenous hydration and uric acid–lowering therapies are the mainstay of management of low- and intermediate-risk TLS. Alkalinization of urine was preferred in view of increased urinary solubility of uric acid; however, recent evidence suggests that urine alkalinization increases calcium phosphate precipitation in the renal tubules, particularly in patients with TLS and hyperphosphatemia. Therefore, alkalinization of urine is not recommended in TLS prophylaxis when the urine pH is above 7.0. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, preventing conversion of xanthine to uric acid. Of note, allopurinol does not lower existing hyperuricemia as seen in the patient. Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase and rapidly decreases uric acid levels by enzymatically degrading them. Rasburicase rapidly reduces preexisting hyperuricemia and does not lead to xanthine accumulation, unlike allopurinol. Rasburicase should be avoided in patients\n\nwith glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency because it may lead to methemoglobinemia, severe hemolytic crisis, and worsening acute kidney injury. X-linked G6PD deficiency is prevalent in people of sub-Saharan African descent; rasburicase should be avoided in this patient because of the increased risk of hemolysis. Per US Food and Drug Administration recommendations, patients at high risk for G6PD deficiency (those of African or Mediterranean descent) should be tested for G6PD deficiency before initiation of therapy with rasburicase. In addition, genotyping (usually performed in newborn screens) tests only a few variants, and confirmation with enzyme activity is the best test to distinguish between normal and deficient G6PD phenotypes. As such, in this patient, the available uric acid–lowering therapies cannot avoid the immediate need for hemodialysis in view of spontaneous TLS before initiation of therapy, with acute kidney injury and volume overload. A recent Cochrane review that evaluated urate oxidase for the prevention and treatment of TLS concluded that there is a lack of good randomized clinical trials showing reduced clinical TLS, acute kidney injury, or mortality. The review also noted that adverse effects might be more common for urate oxidase compared with allopurinol. PREP Pearls Tumor lysis syndrome is characterized by metabolic abnormalities, such as hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia, with or without hypocalcaemia and uremia.

    "explanation": "The patient in this vignette has rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage with renal biopsy findings suggestive of anti- glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody disease. Anti-GBM disease is an immune-complex small vessel vasculitis characterized by antibodies to basement membrane antigens in glomerular and alveolar capillaries. Anti- GBM disease is rare in children. The highest incidence is seen in the third decade of life, more commonly among males. There is a second peak in the sixth to seventh decade of life. The majority of patients with anti-GBM disease present with acute glomerulonephritis with a rapidly progressive course. As many as 50% of patients will require dialysis during the initial presentation. The need for renal replacement therapy is associated with lower likelihood of long-term renal recovery. About 40% to 60% of patients also have pulmonary involvement at presentation. The pulmonary manifestations can present as\n\nhemoptysis or more severe pulmonary hemorrhage leading to respiratory failure. A small percentage of patients can have pulmonary involvement without renal disease. The differential diagnosis of anti-GBM disease includes other pulmonary-renal syndromes, including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The diagnosis of anti-GBM disease is based on the detection of anti-GBM antibodies in the circulation or in tissue specimens. The GBM is composed of type IV collagen, which is made up of several chains, including α3, α4, and α5. Each α chain consists of an N-terminal collagenous 7S domain and a C- terminal non-collagenous (NC1) domain. The pathogenic antibodies in anti- GBM disease are primarily IgG (IgG1 and IgG3) targeted at the C-terminal NC1 domain of the α3 chain of type IV collagen. Anti-GBM disease presents with pulmonary and renal involvement since this basement membrane antigen is expressed primarily in glomerular and alveolar capillaries. Although anti-GBM disease is primarily mediated through humoral immunity, there may also be a contribution of T cell–mediated glomerular injury. The pathogenesis of anti-GBM disease is thought to be a result of an environmental trigger in a genetically predisposed individual. The majority of patients with anti-GBM disease express human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR15 or DR4 alleles, whereas HLA-DR1 and DR7 may be protective. In patients with an underlying genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, such as smoking, hydrocarbons, and infections (eg, influenza), may trigger autoantibody production. Inflammation induced by these toxins or infections in the lung disrupt the normal structure of the alveolar basement membrane, exposing the antigen and stimulating autoantibody production. Circulating anti-GBM Ab can be detected with ELISA using purified or recombinant human or animal GBM antigens. Anti-GBM assays have high sensitivity (95% to 100%) and specificity (91% to 100%), although negative tests can be seen in patients with atypical antigens or atypical IgG subclass. Western blot can detect antibodies against human α3 (IV) NC1 domain when ELISA is negative. Up to 10% of patients will not have circulating antibodies\n\ndetected, so kidney biopsy is still an important component in the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease. Renal biopsy also provides information on the severity and acuity of disease. On renal biopsy, light microscopy typically shows a crescentic glomerulonephritis, with crescents usually of similar age and chronicity. This is in contrast to other pulmonary-renal syndromes such as ANCA vasculitis, where crescents may be in different stages of cellularity or fibrosis. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are less common in anti-GBM disease given the typically fulminant presentation of disease. Direct immunofluorescence classically shows linear deposition of IgG along the glomerular capillaries. Immunofluorescence can be negative in cases of severe glomerular injury where the normal architecture is disrupted. Linear immunofluorescence can also be seen in other conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus and diabetes. The N-terminal collagenous 7S domain of α5 chain of type IV collagen is not the typical target of anti-GBM antibody as described above. Anti-proteinase 3 antibodies are a subgroup of ANCA antibodies that are classically seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which can also present with a pulmonary- renal syndrome and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. However, immunofluorescence in ANCA vasculitis is usually pauci-immune. As many as 20% to 30% of patients with anti-GBM disease can also have positive ANCA; however, this is usually due to myeloperoxidase. Overlap of anti-GBM and ANCA is less common among children. It is thought that ANCA-induced glomerular inflammation triggers the anti-GBM response through exposure of previously sequestered antigens. Mutations in the α5 chain of type IV collagen are observed in patients with Alport syndrome. PREP Pearls Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is a pulmonary-renal syndrome, which typically presents with a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. The pathogenic antibodies in anti-glomerular basement membrane\n\ndisease are targeted at the NC1 domain of the α3 chain of type IV collagen. Renal biopsy in anti-glomerular basement membrane disease shows linear deposition of IgG along glomerular capillaries on immunofluorescence.

    "explanation": "The adolescent in the vignette has evidence of an acute salicylate ingestion. The next best step in the treatment of this patient is to initiate urinary alkalinization with intravenous sodium bicarbonate. This treatment would be\n\nthe first step while dialysis access is obtained for either short-term hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (whichever can be initiated faster). Activated charcoal is not the preferred next step in this patient because the ingestion happened more than 2 hours earlier. Salicylates were first recognized as a potential therapeutic agent more than 3,500 years ago; however, acetylsalicylic acid was first marketed as a drug at the end of the 19th century. Salicylates have many therapeutic uses, including analgesia, antipyretic, and inhibition of platelet aggregation. With the recognition of a link between salicylates and Reye syndrome, they are now less often used within pediatrics; however, they are still present in many over- the-counter medications, including bismuth subsalicylate solutions, for the treatment of diarrhea and gastrointestinal upset. Salicylates can be associated with multiple complications associated with acute or chronic overdosing. Individuals can report symptoms, including tinnitus, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, deep breathing, fever, sweating, and altered mental status. At high levels (eg, >70-100 mg/dL), individuals are at risk for serious complications, including cerebral edema, seizures, pulmonary edema, and cardiovascular collapse. On ingestion, acetylsalicylic acid is rapidly metabolized into salicylic acid, which at normal therapeutic dosing is extensively bound to serum albumin. With toxic ingestions, the capacity for albumin to bind to salicylic acid is exceeded, and free salicylic acid is present within the blood. This condition leads to multiple physiologic effects, including increased respiratory drive and deep breathing, resulting in a respiratory alkalosis. Salicylic acid causes uncoupling of the mitochondrial respiratory transport chain, which ultimately leads to excessive lactic acid production from excessive anaerobic metabolism and results in a large anion gap metabolic acidosis. As a result of mitochondrial effects, individuals can deplete their glycogen stores and hypoglycemia can develop. A variety of changes can happen within the kidneys, which include increased urinary potassium excretion.\n\nManagement of salicylate toxicity begins with assessing the ABCs (airway- breathing-circulation) as well as determining the salicylate level. Patients with salicylate toxicity will require intravenous hydration. Initial resuscitation can be with 0.9% normal saline or a balanced crystalloid solution. Urinary alkalinization with intravenous bicarbonate can help correct the metabolic acidosis and facilitates urinary clearance of salicylic acid. If the patient is seen within 2 hours of ingestion, activated charcoal can be helpful to decrease absorption of the salicylic acid from the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with very high levels, extracorporeal therapies are used to increase clearance of the free salicylate from the blood. Short-term hemodialysis provides the most rapid clearance of salicylates; however, high flow rate continuous renal replacement therapy can be useful and decreases the chance of a rebound increase in salicylate levels after hemodialysis is discontinued. PREP Pearls Toxic salicylate ingestion results in an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis and can be fatal at very high salicylate levels. Urinary alkalinization with intravenous bicarbonate increases urinary excretion of salicylates and helps to correct the metabolic acidosis.

He was born at 39 weeks’ gestation by an emergency caesarean section because of fetal distress. The mother had gestational diabetes, but the pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated. Meconium-stained fluid was present at the time of delivery. The boy had labored breathing and bradycardia in the delivery room that required positive pressure ventilatory support followed by intubation. He was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and continued to receive mechanical ventilatory support for 4 days, after which he was able to wean to supplemental oxygen and then room air. He was discharged home at 2 weeks of age. At the time of hospital discharge, he was feeding well and had good weight gain with standard infant formula. He was taking no medications. In the emergency department, he is fussy and difficult to console but afebrile. His weight has decreased by 400 g from his weight at hospital discharge 1 week earlier.

    "explanation": "This 3-week-old, former full-term infant with a history of neonatal depression currently has dermatologic findings and hypercalcemia indicative of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn (SCFN). SCFN is a rare panniculitis that classically affects term neonates and is characterized by erythematous, violaceous, indurated subcutaneous nodules or plaques primarily on the extremities, back (Figure), buttocks, and face. The chest and abdomen are usually spared. Lesions can vary in size up to several centimeters, and adjacent lesions can be confluent. Lesions may be tender. SCFN usually occurs within the first 6 weeks after birth, with approximately half of cases presenting within the first week after birth. The differential diagnosis for SCFN includes cellulitis, cold panniculitis, and sclerema neonatorum. As opposed to SCFN, sclerema neonatorum is a diffuse hardening of the skin that tends to occur in premature infants or infants with underlying congenital anomalies or sepsis. The pathogenesis of SCFN is unknown; however, it is primarily observed in neonates with a history of perinatal complications, including hypoxia, meconium aspiration, obstetric trauma, or maternal-fetal Rh incompatibility. There is often a history of maternal complications, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia, or placental abruption. Use of therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal asphyxia is a risk factor for SCFN. The development of SCFN is thought to be related to the relatively high concentration of saturated fats in neonatal fat, which have a high melting point. In the setting of hypothermia or hypoperfusion, the saturated fats crystallize and lead to necrosis of adipocytes and subcutaneous granulomatous inflammation. Although SCFN can be diagnosed based on clinical findings, the diagnosis can be confirmed with skin biopsy or fine needle aspiration. The characteristic histologic findings include necrosis of adipocytes with a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate that consists of\n\nhistiocytes, eosinophils, and multinucleated giant cells. Radially arranged, birefringent, needle-shaped crystals and focal areas of calcification can be seen within adipocytes. SCFN is generally benign and resolves without intervention. However, hypercalcemia occurs in approximately 50% of affected infants and can be severe. Hypercalcemia can present with lethargy, poor feeding, vomiting, constipation, and nephrocalcinosis. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have also been reported in SCFN, although the pathophysiology is unclear. The pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in SCFN is not fully understood. The most likely mechanism is thought to be increased extrarenal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from the granulomatous lesions, similar to what is observed in other granulomatous diseases, such as sarcoidosis. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium and calcium mobilization from bones. Most infants with SCFN have appropriately elevated urinary calcium excretion and appropriately suppressed parathyroid hormone levels in the setting of hypercalcemia. Initial treatment of hypercalcemia in SCFN includes restriction of supplemental calcium and vitamin D, use of low calcium and vitamin D formula preparations, hyperhydration with intravenous normal saline fluids, and loop diuretics. In cases of severe hypercalcemia, systemic corticosteroids, calcitonin, and bisphosphonates may be needed. Hypercalcemia can be present at the time of initial diagnosis or develop as the subcutaneous nodules begin to resolve. All infants with SCFN should have calcium monitored at presentation and during follow-up. Late-onset hypercalcemia has been reported, so expert opinion has suggested screening for hypercalcemia at the time of SCFN diagnosis and then at 30, 45, and 60 days after resolution of the skin lesions in case of delayed hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia attributable to an elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D level would suggest vitamin D intoxication. However, this finding is unlikely in this infant, who is taking standard infant formula with no history of vitamin D\n\nsupplementation. Hypercalcemia attributable to elevated parathyroid hormone levels would suggest primary hyperparathyroidism. In cases of SCFN, the parathyroid hormone is usually normal or suppressed in the setting of hypercalcemia. A low urine calcium-creatinine ratio would suggest inappropriately low urinary calcium excretion in the setting of hypercalcemia, which could be seen in disorders such as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. PREP Pearls Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn typically presents in the first few weeks after birth with erythematous, subcutaneous nodules, or plaques primarily on the extremities, back, buttocks, and face. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn primarily affects term neonates with a history of perinatal depression, asphyxia, and/or hypothermia. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn generally resolves spontaneously but can be complicated by hypercalcemia, most likely because of excessive production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from granulomatous lesions.
