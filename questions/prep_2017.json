Her posttransplant\nimmunosuppression includes 5 doses of injectable rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin, 1 mg/kg per dose,\nand a rapid taper of intravenous steroids. For oral maintenance immunosuppression, she is initially\nprescribed tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil twice daily liquid under an oral steroid-avoidance\nprotocol. She is able to maintain appropriate 12-hour trough tacrolimus levels.

    "explanation": "B. faster metabolism of sirolimus in children than in adults\nIn the patient described in the vignette, the most likely reason for undetectable sirolimus levels in this\nvery young child is faster metabolism of the drug. The drug levels are measured in serum, not the\nintracellular white blood cell compartment, as is done with cysteine levels. At her age, her parents will\nbe administering the drug, and new-onset nonadherence is unlikely. In young children, compounding\nerrors, dosing errors, and stability with liquid preparations also need to be considered. Sirolimus and\nmycophenolate do not significantly affect each other’s metabolism. Racial differences may also have\na bearing on drug metabolism.\nThe immunosuppression medications that are used for children after organ transplantation are the\nsame that are used in adults. Thus, the induction medications, rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin,\nbasiliximab, and alemtuzumab, are the same in both age groups. Similarly, oral maintenance\nmedications in both groups currently include the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs; cyclosporine,\ntacrolimus), DNA synthesis inhibitors (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolate sodium),\nsteroids, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORis; sirolimus, everolimus). The\nimmunosuppression protocols also generally follow a similar pattern in adults or children. Most but not\nall programs currently administer 1 induction agent followed by 2 or 3 oral maintenance agents, 1\nfrom each group. The mTORis, if used, are generally administered 3 months after transplant to avoid\nwound healing problems and are generally used in a CNI-sparing regimen, although they may be\nused in combination with any of the other agents.\nAll the oral maintenance agents were initially tested in adult kidney transplant recipients. Dose\nrecommendations in the US Food and Drug Administration approval inserts were therefore based\nentirely on adult patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring and concentration-controlled dosing (ie, based\non drug levels vs fixed dosing) are recommended for the CNIs and mTORis but not for DNA synthesis\ninhibitors or steroids, given the high variability in area under the curve (AUC) exposure at similar\ndosage for CNI and mTORi drugs. Dosing in children then had to be extrapolated down based on\nassumptions and case report experience. Dosing recommendations on a per kilogram or per square\nmeter basis that are currently practiced for children are given in the Table.\nTable. Starting Dosages of Maintenance Immunosuppressive Agents\nDrug Starting Dose\nTacrolimus 0.05-0.1 mg/kg per dose twice daily\nCyclosporine 3-4 mg/kg per dose twice daily\nMycophenolate 450-600 mg/m2 per dose, twice\ndaily\nAzathioprine 1-3 mg/kg per dose once daily\nPrednisone 0.5-2 mg/kg per dose once daily\nSirolimus 1 mg/m2 once daily\nNotably, one of the main differences between children and adults is the faster drug metabolism in the\nformer, especially in very young children. Such differences were first shown for cyclosporine. Hence,\nmany young children required not twice-daily but 3-times-daily dosing for cyclosporine. Similar faster\nmetabolism has been reported by Schachter et al for sirolimus, necessitating twice-daily rather than\nonce-daily dosing of this drug in very young children.\nFor the mycophenolate preparations, fixed dosing is currently practiced because most data suggest\npoor correlation between trough levels of drug or its metabolite with AUC exposure. Cyclosporine and\ntacrolimus affect mycophenolate differently. A dose-dependent cyclosporine-induced inhibition of\nmycophenolic acid glucuronidation occurs, which is not seen with tacrolimus. Therefore, a lower\nmycophenolate exposure occurs with concomitant cyclosporine, and relatively higher mycophenolate\nexposure occurs with concomitant tacrolimus. Thus, the currently recommended mycophenolate\n\nmofetil dose in pediatric patients with concomitant cyclosporine is higher at 600 mg/m2 per dose twice\ndaily; the recommended mycophenolate mofetil dose with concomitant tacrolimus or without a\nconcurrent calcineurin inhibitor is lower at 450 mg/m2 per dose twice daily. However, some data\nsuggest that concentration controlled dosing of mycophenolate may be more appropriate for children\nwith these drugs. Paradoxically, trials of steroid avoidance in children found excessive leukopenia\nwith mycophenolate, necessitating lowering of mycophenolate mofetil dosing to 300 mg/m2 per dose.\nBoth steroids and cyclosporine are metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme of the cytochrome P450\ncatalytic system. Theoretically, high steroid concentrations during a rejection episode could\ncompetitively inhibit cyclosporine metabolism, increasing its systemic concentration and decreasing\nits dose requirements.\nPREP Pearls\n Faster immunosuppressive drug metabolism occurs in children.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the principles governing immunosuppressive drug dosages for children receiving renal transplants\nSuggested Readings\n Cooney GF, Habucky K, Hoppu K.

    "explanation": "D. phenoxybenzamine\nThe patient described in the vignette presents with typical findings for pheochromocytoma (PCC).\nPCCs are catecholamine-secreting tumors that are a rare cause of secondary hypertension (present\nin 0.2%-0.6% of patients with hypertension). Norepinephrine and epinephrine lead to hypertension by\nstimulation of α- and β-adrenergic receptors (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Simplified diagram of ɑ- and β-adrenergic receptors.\nInitial treatment of PCC-induced hypertension focuses on α-adrenergic blockade. There are protocols\nfor both α -selective adrenergic blockers (prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin) and α - and α -blockers\n1 1 2\n(phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine). Most recent guidelines recommend nonselective α-blockade\n(with phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine) slightly over α -selective blockers (eg, prazosin) as initial\n1\ntherapy. Thus, the most appropriate initial treatment for the hypertension of the patient described in\nthe vignette is phenoxybenzamine. Nonselective α-blockers are associated with less risk of\nhypertensive crisis but more risk of postoperative hypotension (phenoxybenzamine has a half-life of\n24 hours). The downsides of α -selective blockers is that they often are insufficient on their own to\n1\ncontrol blood pressure and give higher risk for hypertensive crises. However, they pose less risk of\npostoperative hypotension. Thus, if using α -selective blockade as initial therapy, it is often\n1\nrecommended to use it in combination with a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine or nifedipine or\nnicardipine). Unfortunately, there are limited studies comparing multidrug regimens. Although calcium\nchannel blockers may be used in addition to α-blockade, isradipine is not the preferred initial therapy,\nmaking isradipine the incorrect choice for the patient in the vignette. Clonidine is an α -agonist and\n2\nwould not be a first-line therapy for PCCs.\nA common adverse effect of β-blockade with nonselective agents is reflex tachycardia. In general, this\nis treated with β-blockade. However, if β-blockade is introduced before α-blockade, it can lead to\nunopposed α-stimulation and vasoconstriction without opposition by the vasodilating β -receptors,\n2\nleading to hypertensive crisis and pulmonary edema. The pulmonary edema can be further worsened\nby the negative inotropic effect of the β-blockade.\nAlthough labetalol targets α -, β -, and β -receptors, its use has been associated with hypertensive\n1 1 2\ncrisis, and it is therefore not recommended as initial therapy. Thus, labetalol should not be used for\nthe patient in the vignette.\nUsually, β-blockade is begun 10 to 14 days before surgery, with a goal of controlling blood pressures\nto less than 130/80 mm Hg and no blood pressure higher than 160/90 mm Hg for 24 hours before\n\nsurgery (in adults). Heart rate should be less than 80 beats/min (in adults). β-Blockade–induced\northostatic hypotension is expected and treated with hydration and high salt intake. β-Blockers are\nused when needed for tachycardia. In addition to preoperative α-blockade, patients should undergo\nelectrocardiography and echocardiography to assess for risk of arrhythmias and dilated\ncardiomyopathy. An additional preoperative criterion is that the electrocardiogram free of ST-T\nchanges for at least 1 week, with no more than 1 premature ventricular contraction every 5 minutes.\nAmong 30 pediatric patients treated at the Mayo Clinic during a 30-year period, hypertension,\npalpitations, and headache were the most common presenting symptoms associated with PCC.\nHypertension can be paroxysmal or sustained. Other common presenting symptoms include anxiety,\ntremor, syncope, weight changes, and tachycardia. Some patients are diagnosed with PCC despite\nbeing asymptomatic; for example, there are guidelines for screening asymptomatic patients with\ngenetic syndromes where the risk for PCC is high (as high as 30% in patients with von Hippel-Lindau\nsyndrome).\nPCCs are neuroendocrine tumors that originate from the neural crest–derived chromaffin cells of the\nadrenal medulla. Paragangliomas are similar tumors that originate from neural crest–derived ganglia\noutside the adrenal gland (and may be derived from either parasympathetic or sympathetic ganglia).\nHistorically, PCCs were reported to follow the rule of 10s (10% familial, 10% bilateral, and 10%\nmalignant), but recent studies have found that tumor location and malignancy risk vary with\nunderlying genetic mutations. Approximately one-third of PCCs and paraganglioma tumors are now\nknown to have germline mutations (sporadic or familial) in more than 25 susceptibility genes. An\nadditional third of tumors have somatic mutations in these genes. Thus, approximately 60% of tumors\nhave identifiable gene mutations. The susceptibility genes include 3 genes associated with\nsyndromes that can have PCCs as a manifestation: NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1), VHL (von Hippel-\nLindau disease), and RET (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2). Many of the susceptibility genes\nencode members of the succinate dehydrogenase complex or Krebs cycle. Mutations in these\nand VHL and HIF2A (hypoxia inducible factor 2α) are thought to affect hypoxia and vascular\nendothelial growth factor signaling pathways. Another set of mutations, including those\nof TMEM127 and MAX, are thought to affect mammalian target of rapamycin signaling.\nCatecholamines and metanephrines, as well as vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid\n(HVA), are all derived from dopamine (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Simplified diagram of catecholamine production and metabolism.\n\nTyrosine is converted to dopamine by tyrosine hydroxylase in multiple organs, including central\nnervous system, sympathetic nerves, adrenal and extra-adrenal chromaffin cells, gastrointestinal\ntract, and kidney. Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla convert norepinephrine to epinephrine. The\ncatecholamines are metabolized to metanephrines and then to VMA and HVA. In part because of the\nchallenges of 24-hour urine collection, many advocate for screening for PCC in children using plasma\nmetanephrines. Serum levels are very low (relative to urine), and so initially some laboratories had\ndifficulty with making the assay reliable, but it has been increasingly commercially available. Plasma\nnormetanephrine and metanephrine are more often elevated in PCC than plasma catecholamines\nand have a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 96%. The diagnosis is often confirmed using other\nstudies. In the case series of the Mayo Clinic, 93% had a diagnosis of a catecholamine-secreting\ntumor confirmed using urinary 24-hour excretion for fractionated catecholamines (dopamine,\nnorepinephrine, and epinephrine), metanephrine, normetanephrine, VMA, and HVA. These urinary\nstudies have varying rates of specificity and sensitivity. Urinary fractionated metanephrines have a\nhigh sensitivity (97%) and are useful for ruling out the diagnosis but have a low specificity. Urinary\ncatecholamines have a high specificity (99%) and are useful for confirming a diagnosis. Urinary VMA\nalso have a high specificity (95%) but low sensitivity. Imaging studies (computed tomography or\nmagnetic resonance imaging) or iodine-123-meta-iodobenzylguanidine or fluorodopa positron\nemission tomography may be used to localize the tumor.\nSurgical resection is the preferred treatment of nonmetastatic PCCs. Because of catecholamine\nsecretion, tumor resection can be complicated by life-threatening hypertension (with catecholamine\nrelease during tumor manipulation) and hypotension (due to residual effects of antihypertensives after\ntumor removal). Thus, careful perioperative planning and close blood pressure, heart rate, and\nglucose monitoring by the anesthesiology team is needed. Because of the rarity of PCCs, there are\nfew randomized clinical trials, and controversy continues to surround many perioperative\nrecommendations. However, mortality rates were as high as 45% before α-adrenergic blockade was\nintroduced as standard of care and are now closer to 3%. Patients with PCCs tend to be\nhypovolemic, and volume expansion preoperatively is also recommended by many.\nPREP Pearls\n Up to 60% of pheochromocytomas are associated with somatic or germline genetic mutations.\n β-Blockade before ɑ-blockade in treatment of pheochromocytoma-induced hypertension can precipitate a\nhypertensive crisis.\n Preoperative ɑ-blockade and close perioperative monitoring are critical to avoid mortality during surgical\nresection of pheochromocytomas.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know how to treat hypertension secondary to a pheochromocytoma and the strategies to optimize operative\nmanagement\nSuggested Readings\n Fishbein L, Orlowski R, Cohen D.

    "explanation": "B. decreasing because of decreased impetigo rates from increased access to medical care and\nchanges in the bacterial causes of cellulitis\nThe incidence of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) in the United States is decreasing\nbecause of decreased impetigo rates from increased access to medical care and changes in the\nbacterial causes of cellulitis. Although PSGN and rheumatic fever are both decreasing in incidence,\nand possibly because of similar reasons, the 2 diseases are not caused by the same strains of group\nA Streptococcus (GAS). Nephritogenic strains of GAS are opacity factor positive, whereas\nrheumatogenic strains are factor negative.\nPSGN is the best known form of postinfectious glomerulonephritis. The association of dark and\nscanty urine after scarlet fever has been known for centuries. Because it was later discovered in the\n1920s that scarlet fever was caused by an infection with group A Streptococcus, this postscarlatinal\nrenal disease was correctly termed PSGN. PSGN has historically been the most common cause of\nglomerulonephritis in children worldwide and in the United States, with a global burden estimated at\nclose to 500,000 cases annually. However, there have been changes in the epidemiology of this\ndisorder with improvements in global health care, causing shifts in population susceptibility, reported\nincidence, and possibly even disease severity.\nLike many diseases, the reporting of the worldwide incidence of PSGN is limited by the manner of\nreporting by individual nations. For PSGN, most of the reported international data are based on\nhospitalization rates for the disease with the overall incidence estimated as a ratio of actual cases to\nthe number of hospitalized cases. Using this method, despite its limitations, the most recent estimates\nfrom 2007 predicted that there 472,000 incident cases of PSGN worldwide, with 456,000 cases in\ndeveloping nations alone. This gave an annual incidence of 9.3 cases per 100,000 persons in\ndeveloping countries. However, this may underestimate the true incidence of PSGN in many\ndeveloping countries because they may lack the medical infrastructure to track, let alone report, such\ndata.\nDespite the limitations, longitudinal studies of PSGN hospitalizations have found a decreasing\nincidence of the disease worldwide. This decrease in incidence has been reported in less developed\n(Chile, Venezuela, Mexico, Nigeria, India) and developed (China, Singapore, South Korea, Italy,\nAustralia) countries. Reasons cited for the decreasing incidence worldwide are improvement of\naccess to medical care (ie, antibiotics) and improved public hygiene in many of the less developed\nworld. Despite a decreasing overall incidence in countries with higher indexes of health, there are still\nsmall epidemics or clusters of cases reported from poorer communities within these countries,\nlocated in either rural or aboriginal settings, where care may not be the same as in other regions of\nthese nations.\nSimilar to the rest of the world, the incidence of PSGN in the United States is also decreasing. The\npediatric nephrology group in Memphis reported a decrease in annual hospitalization rates for PSGN\nof 80% from the 1960s (31 patients per year) to the 1980s (5.9 patients per year). Similarly, the\ngroup in Jacksonville, Florida, documented a decreasing annual incidence of 2.18 hospital cases per\n100,000 persons in their early cohort (1957-1973) vs only 0.64 cases in their later cohort (2000s). In\nboth these studies there was a shift in the antecedent infection causing PSGN seen between the 2\neras, with pyoderma being the predominant cause in the early cohorts and pharyngitis in the later\ncohorts. In fact, the Florida study also found that the incidence of impetigo causing PSGN had\ndecreased 5-fold, whereas the incidence of pharyngitis was statistically unchanged, although slightly\nincreased. Both studies also saw a shift in the demographics of patients who developed PSGN, from\nmostly African Americans to whites and from urban to rural inhabitants, as well as the time of year of\npresentation from the autumn (peak time for impetigo) to the winter and spring.\n\nThe given reasons for the decreasing incidence of PSGN in the United States are similar to those\ngiven for developing countries: better health care delivery, more widespread use of antibiotics, and\nimproved socioeconomic conditions. However, there may be additional factors as well. The Florida\nstudy noted that there had been a significant change in the predominant cause of pyodermal\ninfections in their region, from Streptococcus pyogenes to Staphylococcus aureus. This shift in\nimpetigo-causing agents has also been seen in other countries, and it remains unclear whether this is\nan effect of greater antibiotic use for GAS cellulitis or the increasing resistance of S aureus to certain\nantibiotics.\nAnother cause is a possible decrease in the overall virulence of the bacterium. GAS is commonly\nsubtyped by its surface M proteins, which help determine its virulence. Since the 1970s, however, it\nhas been known that another protein, serum opacity factor, may be a determinant of secondary\nsequelae of GAS infection. Opacity factor–positive strains, which consist of a certain subset of M\nsubtypes, have been associated with causing glomerulonephritis, explaining their classification as so-\ncalled nephritogenic strains. Interestingly, opacity factor–negative strains include those that may be\nrheumatogenic. The epidemiology of PSGN and acute rheumatic fever, the other significant\ncomplication of GAS, are not perfectly in parallel to each other because they are caused by different\nGAS strains. Thus, the 2 disorders have biological and epidemiologic differences, although both are\ndecreasing in incidence worldwide.\nNephritogenic strains of GAS may also be further subdivided into those that primarily cause\npharyngitis (M types 12, 1, 4, and 25) and those that primarily cause pyoderma (types 49, 2, 42, 56,\n57, and 60). The change in overall serotypes, from pyodermal to pharyngitic strains, may be causing\nless severe disease and, therefore, less need for hospitalization. In addition, there has been evidence\nof frameshift mutations to the genes involved in capsular production seen in strains found in carriers\nof GAS, which may allow for better survival of these strains within the host at the expense of their\noverall virulence, such that many of the disease strains causing pharyngitis in some hosts are less\nvirulent overall.\nThe natural history of PSGN in the United States is the presentation of acute nephritis (hematuria,\nedema, hypertension, oliguria) following a latent period after the GAS infection. This latent period may\nvary from 7 to 10 days in the case of pharyngitis to 2 to 4 weeks in the case of cellulitis. These\nsymptoms typically improve after 2 to 7 days, with the visible hematuria often resolving first followed\nby an increase in urine volume and rapid resolution of edema. Serum C3 is typically decreased at\ntime of presentation and will gradually increase back to normal levels during the next 4 to 6 weeks.\nThere is thought to be limited long-term sequelae from the disease in most cases, with protracted\nmicroscopic hematuria being the most common finding. A few cases may manifest as nephrotic\nsyndrome or as a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, with severe impairment of renal function\nrequiring intervention.\nHowever, in developing countries, PSGN remains a common cause of acute and chronic kidney\ninjury. Single-center reports from equatorial regions of the world (Africa, the Middle East, India, and\nSouth America) have cited PSGN as the cause of acute kidney injury in 5% to 50% of all hospitalized\npediatric patients. These reports often cite a greater need for intervention in these patients, with\nshort-term dialysis, mechanical ventilation, and treatment of heart failure often noted. There are also\nreports of higher rates of long-term sequelae, specifically protracted proteinuria and hypertension,\nwithin these populations. Australian aboriginals who had PSGN have a 6-fold greater risk of\nmacroalbuminuria compared with those who did not, whereas high rates of impaired renal function\nhave been reported after large outbreaks of PSGN. These discrepancies in disease acuity and\nchronicity are not easily explained because they may be secondary to genetic predisposition, overall\npopulations studied (because many international studies may also include adults who are more\nsusceptible to long-term sequelae), or differences in GAS strain virulence.\n\nPREP Pearls\n Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) has historically been the most common cause of\nglomerulonephritis in children worldwide and in the United States, but the incidence of this disease has\nsignificantly decreased in both developed and underdeveloped nations.\n Much of the decline in PSGN in the United States is from a reduction in pyodermal infections, leading to\nnephritis, which may be attributable to ready and prompt treatment of impetigo or a shift in the bacterial causes\nof cellulitis from predominantly ꞵ-hemolytic Streptococcus to Staphylococcus aureus.\n Acute rheumatic fever and PSGN are both complications of group A Streptococcus infections, but they are\ncaused by different bacterial strains; therefore, the 2 diseases are epidemiologically different and are extremely\nrarely seen in the same patient.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the natural history and epidemiology of post-infectious glomerulonephritis\nSuggested Readings\n Ilyas M, Tolaymat A.

One family’s\nyearly income may be $80,125, another may be $80,126.50, and yet another may be $81,100.16.\nThis is in contrast to a categorical variable, which is a qualitative, discrete variable with a limited\nnumber of possibilities. There are 3 main types of categorical variables: dichotomous, nominal, and\nordinal.\nDichotomous variables are variables or descriptive characteristics that can only be divided into 2\ncategories, for example, has disease/doesn’t have disease, yes/no, or male/female.\nVariables with more than 2 categories are either nominal or ordinal variables. Examples are eye color\n(green, blue, brown), race (per US Census Bureau: white, black/African American, American\nIndian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander), and Likert pain scales (no hurt,\nhurts little bit, hurts little more, hurts even more, hurts whole lot, hurts worst). When the categorical\nvariable has an order or hierarchy to it (hurts worst > no hurt), this is considered an ordinal\nvariable. When there is no order/hierarchy (eye color, race), then the variable is a nominal variable.\nSometimes variables that could be continuous variables (eg, income level) are collected or reported\nas categorical variables (as described in the vignette: <$50,000, $50,000-$75,000, $75,001-\n$100,000, >$100,000) instead of being reported as a distinct/exact number (ie, $80,101). Another\ncommon example of this is with blood pressure (ordinal variables: normotensive, prehypertensive,\nstage I hypertension, stage II hypertension) instead of being reported as a continuous variable\n(135/88 mm Hg). This is occasionally done for ease of reporting or describing study populations or\nbecause of statistical considerations (calculating an odds ratio, investigating for interaction, etc).\nPREP Pearls\n Variables are either continuous or categorical.\n Categorical variables can further be described as dichotomous (2 distinct choices), nominal (>2 categories, no\norder/hierarchy), or ordinal (>2 categories with a specific order/hierarchy).\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Distinguish types of variables (eg, continuous, categorical, ordinal, nominal)\nSuggested Readings\n Shoben AB.

    "explanation": "D. sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2)\nThe patient described in the vignette has significant glucosuria in the absence of gastrointestinal\nsymptoms or glycogen storage disease and therefore most likely has mutations in the sodium-\nglucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) gene. There are no known mutations of glucose transporter\ntype 1 (GLUT1) that cause renal glucosuria. Although all 3 transporters, sodium-glucose\ncotransporter type 1 (SGLT1), SGLT2, and glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2), regulate transport of\nglucose in many organs, SGLT2 is present almost exclusively in renal proximal tubules.\nAccordingly, SGLT2 loss of function is the primary cause of renal glucosuria.\nThe girl in the vignette has a condition called renal glucosuria. In the absence of hyperglycemia and\nincreased filtered glucose, there are 2 main causes of glucosuria. The first disorder, primary or\nfamilial renal glucosuria (FRG), occurs as an isolated abnormality characterized by glucosuria in the\nabsence of hyperglycemia and in the absence of a generalized tubular dysfunction (as in Fanconi\nsyndrome). The second disorder, glucose-galactose malabsorption, presents in infancy, usually as\nsevere diarrhea and dehydration. Not all patients with glucose-galactose malabsorption present with\nglucosuria; if present, it is usually mild. Both disorders are caused by impaired glucose transport in\nthe proximal tubule.\nGlucose transport in the proximal tubule is mostly transcellular. The early segments (S1 and S2) of\nthe proximal tubule are responsible for the reabsorption of the bulk of filtered glucose, and the\nremainder is reabsorbed in the late proximal segment (S3). A family of sodium-glucose cotransporters\nlocated at the apical membrane couples the uptake of glucose to sodium. A member of this\nfamily, SGLT2, mediates apical glucose uptake in the early proximal tubule (S1 segment). This is a\nhigh-capacity, low-affinity transporter and has a stoichiometry of sodium to glucose of 1. In the late\nproximal tubule (S3 segment), SGLT1 is responsible for apical sodium uptake. SGLT1 is a high-\naffinity, low-capacity cotransporter and has a stoichiometry of sodium to glucose of 2:1. The transport\nof glucose across the basolateral membrane occurs by facilitated diffusion and is mediated by\nanother family of glucose transporters (GLUTs), which are sodium independent. In the early proximal\ntubule, GLUT2 is responsible for basolateral glucose transport, whereas GLUT1 is the main\ntransporter in the late proximal tubule.\nInherited FRG can be autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant and is caused by mutations in\nthe SGLT2 gene. The most severe form of FRG, type 0, is caused by loss-of-function mutations\nof SGLT2, resulting in complete absence of renal tubular reabsorption of glucose. Patients with type\nA and type B usually present with less severe forms of FRG and harbor hypomorphic mutations\nin SGLT2. Patients with FRG, including those with the most severe form (type 0), are generally\nasymptomatic. Of note, SGLT2 inhibitors are now a treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults and work\nby increasing renal glucose excretion. In contrast, patients with the glucose-galactose malabsorption\nsyndrome are usually symptomatic (gastrointestinal symptoms). Glucose-galactose malabsorption is\nan autosomal recessive disease caused by mutation of SGLT1 (gene SLC5A1); given that the role of\nSGLT1 is minor in renal reabsorption of glucose, glucosuria in these patients is usually mild or\nabsent. Loss-of-function mutations of the gene encoding GLUT2 (SLC2A2) cause a rare autosomal\nrecessive glycogen storage disease known as Fanconi-Bickel syndrome. Glucosuria is also a\nmanifestation of GLUT2 mutations because it is involved in basolateral uptake of glucose.\nPREP Pearls\n Isolated renal glucosuria is usually caused by inherited mutations in sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)\nand less commonly in SGLT1 or glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2).\n\n Patients with renal glucosuria due to SGLT2 mutations are asymptomatic, whereas patients\nwith SGLT1 mutations are usually associated with glucose-malabsorption syndrome and gastrointestinal\nsymptoms.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the molecular and genetic basis of renal glucosuria\nSuggested Readings\n Santer R, Kinner M, Lassen CL, et al.

    "explanation": "A. arrange for him to return to your office in a week for repeat blood pressure measurements\nFor the patient described in the vignette, the next best step in management is to arrange for him to\nreturn to your office in a week for repeat blood pressure (BP) measurements. The mean BP\nmeasurement for the patient described in the vignette is 128/78 mm Hg, which is less than the 95th\npercentile (133/83 mm Hg). His obesity should prompt a discussion and education about therapeutic\nlifestyle change, including weight loss, but follow-up of 6 months would be inappropriate at this time. If\nthe patient has sustained elevations in his BP at or above the 95th percentile, then he should undergo\na workup, including laboratory tests, renal ultrasonography, and echocardiography. Because he has\nnot yet been confirmed to be hypertensive, an evaluation for secondary causes is not necessary. An\nantihypertensive medication should be prescribed to children with hypertension if their hypertension is\nsecondary; if they have evidence of end-organ damage, such as left ventricular hypertrophy; if they\nhave diabetes as a comorbidity; if they are symptomatic; or if a trial of therapeutic lifestyle change has\nfailed. This child does not meet any of these criteria.\nA diagnosis of hypertension is made when there is evidence of sustained elevation in BP at or above\nthe 95th percentile for an individual’s age, sex, and height percentile. These BP measurements\nshould be obtained via manual auscultation and should be repeated on 3 separate occasions with 3\nmeasurements obtained at each encounter. If the mean of all these (≥9) manual measurements is the\n95th percentile or higher, the individual is diagnosed with hypertension. Once the diagnosis of\nhypertension is made in a pediatric patient, a laboratory and imaging evaluation should be\nundertaken, and counseling on a heart healthy lifestyle, including weight loss when appropriate,\nshould be initiated. Essential to this is the repeated measurement of BP. BP measurements often\ndecrease over time with sequential measurements. Two possible explanations for this are the\nstatistical phenomenon of regression to the mean and accommodation to the measurement. As with\nany clinically obtained measurements where there is intraindividual variability, repeating the\nmeasurement allows one to get closer to the truth. The more times a measurement is repeated, the\nlower the variance and the increased likelihood of obtaining an accurate result. Repeating a\nmeasurement also allows one to be more comfortable and familiar with the method (an\naccommodation effect), which can further facilitate accurate measurement.\nThe importance of repeated measurement in the diagnosis of hypertension was well described in a\nstudy by Sorof et al in 2004. In this school-based screening study, the investigators measured BP\namong more than 5,100 children. All children with a mean of 3 seated BPs greater than 95th\npercentile were asked to return for repeat measurements. If on the second screen their mean BPs\nremained greater than the 95th percentile, they were asked to return a third time for another set of BP\nmeasurements. The investigators calculated hypertension prevalence among this population using\nmeasurements from only the first visit, the first 2 visits, or all 3 visits. Among this population, if\nhypertension was diagnosed based only on the 3 measurements obtained at the first visit, the\nprevalence of hypertension would be 19%. However, if hypertension was diagnosed after confirming\nthat BPs remained above the 95th percentile on both the first and second visits, the hypertension\nprevalence was almost half that initial estimate (9.5%). Finally, if hypertension was diagnosed based\non sustained elevations of BP above the 95th percentile on all 3 occasions (the current clinical\nrecommendations), the prevalence of hypertension was even lower at 4.5%.\nPREP Pearls\n A diagnosis of hypertension can only be made once an individual’s mean manual blood pressure from 3\nseparate visits is confirmed to be at or above the 95th percentile for an individual’s age, sex, and height\npercentile.\n\n Blood pressure measurements decrease over time with sequential measurements because of regression to the\nmean and accommodation to the measurement.\n An antihypertensive medication should be prescribed to children with hypertension if their hypertension is\nsecondary; if they have evidence of end-organ damage, such as left ventricular hypertrophy; if they have\ndiabetes as a comorbidity; if they are symptomatic; or if a trial of therapeutic lifestyle change has failed.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the role of multiple blood pressure measurements in the diagnosis of hypertension\nSuggested Readings\n Brady TM, Redwine KM, Flynn JT.

    "explanation": "B. hypotonic dehydration\nHyponatremia is defined as a serum or plasma sodium level less than 135 mEq/L (135 mmol/L). It is\namong the most common electrolyte abnormalities in children. Hypotonic dehydration is defined as\nloss of total body water with true hyponatremia in which the serum osmolality is less than normal. A\ndecrease in serum sodium level, and hence a decrease in serum osmolality, can lead to neurologic\nfindings and in severe cases significant morbidity and mortality, especially in those with acute\nchanges in serum sodium concentration.\nThe serum sodium concentration is determined by the ratio between sodium salts and water in the\nextracellular fluid compartment. Thus, the serum sodium concentration in a child with hypovolemia\nvaries with the relative loss of solute to water. Changes in the serum sodium concentration play an\nimportant role in deciding the type and speed of fluid repletion therapy, especially in children with\nsevere hyponatremia or hypernatremia.\nThe development of hyponatremia in the setting of dehydration reflects net solute loss in excess of\nwater loss. Normally, sodium losses in diarrhea are not hypertonic to plasma. Rather, solute and\nwater are lost in equal proportions. In the presence of normal thirst mechanisms, ingested water is\nretained because hypovolemia-induced secretion of antidiuretic hormone limits water excretion and\nthe serum sodium concentration is lowered.\nIn isonatremic dehydration, the serum sodium concentration is between 135 and 145 mEq/L (135-145\nmmol/L). In this setting, solute is lost in proportion to water loss. For example, in patients with\nsecretory diarrhea, the solute concentration of the diarrheal fluid can be similar to the plasma solute\nconcentration, and the serum sodium concentration is not affected.\nIn hypernatremic dehydration, the serum sodium is greater than 145 mEq/L (145 mmol/L), reflecting\nwater loss in excess of solute loss. In children with viral gastroenteritis, such as rotavirus, the sodium\nconcentration of the diarrheal fluid typically ranges from 40 to 100 mEq/L (40-100 mmol/L). Loss of\nthis relatively dilute fluid will tend to induce hypernatremia if there is insufficient water intake, which\nincreases renal sodium reabsorption, aggravating hypernatremic dehydration.\nFever or tachypnea often accompany pediatric illness associated with hypovolemia, resulting in\nincreased insensible water losses, especially in young children. Water is, again, lost in excess of\nsolute, contributing to an increase in serum sodium concentration. A similar effect is seen with dilute\nurinary losses in children with diabetes insipidus.\nPREP Pearls\n Hypotonic dehydration is present when the serum sodium concentration is less than 135 mEq/L (135 mmol/L)\nin the setting of dehydration.\n Hypotonic dehydration usually occurs when volume loss occurs and the thirst mechanism is intact, resulting in\ningestion of free water that then causes hyponatremia.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know how to define hypotonic dehydration\nSuggested Readings\n Edelman IS, Leibman J, O'Meara MP, Birkenfeld LW.

Low C3 and low C4 levels are not likely because these are seen in forms of\nglomerulonephritis that are caused by activation of the classic complement pathway, such as\nsystemic lupus glomerulonephritis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I and type III.\nNormal C3 and low C4 levels are not usually seen in glomerulonephritis. Normal C3 and normal C4\nlevels are seen in normocompletemic glomerulonephritis (Table).\nIn approximately 85% to 95% of patients with postinfectious glomerulonephritis, C3 levels are\nsignificantly low in the first 2 weeks of the disease course. C3 levels typically return to normal within 6\nto 8 weeks of the initial presentation. In postinfectious glomerulonephritis, C4 levels are usually\nnormal, indicating activation of the alternative complement pathway.\nPostinfectious glomerulonephritis is usually associated with a mild decrease in glomerular filtration\nrate, which is detected by an increase in serum creatinine levels. These levels usually return to\nnormal after the initial diagnosis. Acute kidney injury that requires dialysis is uncommon.\n\nUrinalysis in patients with postinfectious glomerulonephritis reveals hematuria with red blood cells\nthat are typically dysmorphic, with or without red blood cell casts. There are varying degrees of\nproteinuria and often pyuria. Nephrotic-range proteinuria of greater than 1,000 mg/m2 per day or 40\nmg/m2 per hour is uncommon and occurs in approximately 5% of cases at presentation. The\nurinalysis should be performed on a freshly voided specimen.\nIn 85% to 95% of case of postinfectious glomerulonephritis, the preceding infection is with specific\nnephritogenic strains of group A β-hemolytic streptococcus. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis can\npresent as sporadic or during an epidemic of group A streptococcal infection. In 10% to 15% of cases\nof postinfectious glomerulonephritis, the preceding infection is with another agent.\nBecause patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis can present weeks after an antecedent\ninfection, only approximately 25% of patients will have a positive throat or skin culture result. In\npatients with impetigo, there is an increased likelihood of obtaining a positive skin culture result.\nElevated titers of antibodies to extracellular streptococcal products is evidence of a recent group A\nstreptococcal infection. Results of the streptozyme test, which measures 5 different streptococcal\nantibodies, are positive in more than 95% of patients with pharyngitis and approximately 80% of those\nwith skin infections. The interval between acute glomerulonephritis after skin infection (2-4 weeks) is\nlonger than the one after throat infection (1-3 weeks).The streptozyme test includes antibodies to\nantistreptolysin, antihyaluronidase (AHase), antistreptokinase, anti-nicotinamide-adenine\ndinucleotidase, and anti-DNase B antibodies. These antibodies can be measured individually as well.\nAfter a pharyngeal infection, the antistreptolysin, anti-DNAse B, anti-nicotinamide-adenine\ndinucleotidase, and AHase titers are commonly elevated, whereas only the anti-DNAse B and AHase\ntiters are elevated after a skin infection.

This hypothesis (the\nalternative hypothesis, which is generally that those with an exposure are more likely to have an\noutcome than those without the exposure or that those receiving an intervention are more likely to\nhave an outcome than those who do not receive the intervention) is then tested against the null\nhypothesis (generally that there is no difference in outcome between those who were exposed vs\nthose who were not or in those who received the intervention vs those who did not). Because we can\nnever know the truth, we use the P value to help determine how much confidence we can have that\nthe observed association or effect was real and not due to chance alone.\nThe P value is the probability of obtaining the observed result (a hazard ratio of 0.65 in the vignette\nabove) or a result more extreme than observed (ie, a hazard ratio smaller than 0.65) when the null\nhypothesis is actually true (there is no difference between those with intensified blood pressure\ncontrol and those without intensified blood pressure control).

    ],
    "correct_index": 1,
    "explanation": "B. the risk of end-stage kidney disease in living donors is the same as that in the general population\nThe risk of end-stage kidney disease in living donors is the same as that in the general population,\nalthough the risk is slightly higher when compared with healthy nondonors. The 90-day mortality after\nliving kidney donation is 0.031% not 1%. The risk of major cardiovascular events is similar or slightly\nhigher, not lower, in donors than in matched healthy nondonors. In addition, black race donors, not\nwhite race donors, have the highest risk of end-stage kidney disease among all racial groups.\nLiving kidney donation offers a special opportunity for children with end-stage kidney disease to\nreceive a kidney transplant. This is the only time that surgeons will perform a major surgery on a\nhealthy person for no medical benefit to the donor but for the medical benefit of someone else.\nTherefore, donors undergo an extensive workup to ensure that they are healthy enough to donate\nand that medical risks to the donor are minimized. Nevertheless, the medical risks to the donor are\nnot zero. Such risks include donor death in the early postdonation period, major adverse\ncardiovascular events, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), hypertension, gestational hypertension,\nand hyperuricemia or gout (Table ).\nThe risk of donor death after living kidney donation is very low. Data from a study by Segev et al,\nusing a linkage of Organ Procurement and Transplant Network registry data with the Social Security\nDeath Master File for 80,347 living donors between 1994 and 2009, revealed a 90-day mortality\nestimate of 3.1 per 10,000 (or 0.031%). This mortality rate did not change significantly during the 15-\nyear study period. In fact, the concept that transplant professionals promoted for a long time was that\nkidney donors live longer. This concept was popularized on the basis of general population\ncomparisons and limited follow-up but with obvious confounding by the fact that living donors undergo\nmedical evaluation and rigorous selection for good health at the time of donation. Therefore, a key\naspect in determining such risks is the selection of the comparison population.\nFor major cardiovascular events, data indicate similar or only slightly higher risk. Garg et al compared\n2028 living kidney donors in Ontario, Canada (1992–2009), with 20,280 healthy, demographically\nmatched nondonors (ie, a healthier population that went through a donor evaluation but were not\nselected) and found that the risk of death or major cardiovascular events during a median 7 years of\n\nfollow-up (maximum, 18 years) was lower in donors than in healthy nondonors. The risk of death-\ncensored major cardiovascular events alone was similar among donors and nondonors (1.7 vs 2.0\nevents per 1,000 person-years). In another study, Mjoen et al found a slightly higher cardiovascular\nmortality after living donation than in healthy nondonors, with a median follow-up of 15 years.\nThe risk of ESKD after kidney donation does not exceed ESKD rates in the general population. An\nanalysis of living kidney donors in the United States between 1994 and 2003 quantified a\npostdonation ESKD rate of 0.134 per 1,000 person-years during a mean follow-up of 9.8 years, which\nwas not higher than the ESKD rate in the general population. However, again, the general population\nis a limited comparison group given the robust medical evaluation that donors undertake.\nRecent studies with individuals selected for baseline good health as the comparison group suggest\nthat donation is associated with a small increase in the risk of ESKD, although the absolute\npostdonation risk remains low. Grams et al found that the 15-year observed risks of ESKD after\ndonation among kidney donors in the United States were 3.5 to 5.3 times as high as the projected\nrisks in the absence of donation. In the same study, when considered by race, black living donors had\nthe highest absolute incidence of ESKD and the highest risk attributable to donation. Currently, the\nliving donor also undertakes certain financial risks, including unpaid time from work, wages lost,\npotentially incomplete coverage of medical costs, and loss of eligibility for life insurance.\nPREP Pearls\n Living kidney donation is generally safe because the donors undergo careful evaluation and selection.\n There are small medical risks to the donor, primarily a low risk of mortality within 90 days of donation and a\nslight increase in risk of later end-stage kidney disease compared with a healthy nondonor population.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Identify the long-term medical and financial risks to the living donor\nSuggested Readings\n Grams ME, San Y, Levey AS, et al.

    "explanation": "B. increased glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient\nElegant single-nephron micropuncture studies performed in maturing rats and guinea pigs have\ndocumented that the postnatal increase in net ultrafiltration pressure (P ) is modest (2.5-fold) and\nuf\naccounts for only approximately 10% of the 25-fold increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during\npostnatal maturation. The maturational increase in glomerular plasma flow, which is mediated by\nchanges in intrarenal vasoactive hormonal systems (angiotensin II, kinins, prostaglandins,\nendothelin), contributes to the postnatal increase in P . However, the major factor that mediates the\nuf\npostnatal increase in GFR is the progressive increase in ultrafiltration coefficient (K) caused by\nf\nenhanced glomerular surface area (8- to 10-fold) attributable to the recruitment of superficial\nnephrons in renal cortex and a modest increase in membrane permeability (1.3-fold). Thus, the most\nimportant factor that causes the immediate postnatal increase in GFR is increased glomerular K.\nf\nThe process of glomerular filtration is first initiated between 9 and 12 weeks of gestational age. In\ngeneral, there is good correlation between GFR with gestational age. The GFR is low during fetal life\nand increases only slightly (2-fold) between 28 and 34 weeks’ gestational age. However, after\napproximately 34 weeks and completion of nephrogenesis, the GFR increases markedly (up to 5-\nfold). Thus, a premature infant will have a small increase in GFR until 34 weeks of gestation.\nPostnatally, there is a rapid rise in GFR factored to kidney weight and body surface area; GFR\nreaches adult values by 2 years of age. The nonlinear increase in GFR (accelerated after\nnephrogenesis is complete) is conserved among other mammalian species. Overall, the maturational\nincrease in absolute GFR from term birth to adulthood is approximately 25-fold.\nThe physiologic determinants of glomerular filtration dynamics include the following:\n The filtration characteristics of glomerular basement membrane–glomerular K\nf\n The P , which is the difference between the mean glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure\nuf\n(glomerular capillary minus Bowman space hydraulic pressures) and the mean colloid osmotic\npressures over the length of the glomerular capillary\n Glomerular plasma flow\nThe capillary hydrostatic pressure favors filtration, whereas the capillary colloid osmotic pressure and\nthe Bowman space hydrostatic pressure oppose it. Thus, the maturational rise in single-nephron GFR\n(SNGFR) can be described in the following formula: SNGFR = K × P , where K is the glomerular\nf uf f\nultrafiltration coefficient and P is the net ultrafiltration pressure, defined earlier. K is the product of the\nuf f\ntotal surface area available for filtration and the hydraulic conductivity (permeability) of the glomerular\nmembrane.\nPREP Pearls\n The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is low during fetal life and increases only slightly between 28 and 34\nweeks’ conceptional age. However, after approximately 34 weeks, the GFR increases markedly within 1 week\nas nephrogenesis is completed.\n After birth, the GFR continues to increase rapidly relative to kidney weight and body surface area until GFR\nreaches adult levels by approximately 2 years of age.\n The major factor that mediates the postnatal increase in GFR is the progressive increase in glomerular\nultrafiltration coefficient or Kf.\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the factors contributing to the increase in glomerular filtration rate after birth\nSuggested Readings\n Robillard JE, Nakamura KT, Matherne GP, Jose PA.

    "explanation": "D. thick ascending loop of Henle\nFor the patient described in the vignette, decreased calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending loop\n(TAL) of Henle is the most likely risk factor for nephrocalcinosis.\nNephrocalcinosis is defined as calcification of the renal parenchyma and was first reported in 1982 in\na cohort of premature infants who had received furosemide. Most of the crystals are likely calcium\noxalate. Reports on the incidence of nephrocalcinosis vary widely, from as low as 7% to as high as\n64% of premature infants with gestational ages younger than 32 weeks or birth weights less than 1.5\nkg. Diagnosis relies on detection of increased echogenicity in the renal medulla. Differences in\nincidence may vary with differences in the premature population studied and in diagnosis of\nnephrocalcinosis by ultrasonography.\nIncreased renal medullary echogenicity can also be observed with renal candidiasis, cytomegalovirus\ninfection, acute renal failure, polycystic kidney disease, and renal vein thrombosis or as a transient\nphenomenon of unclear origin after birth in full-term and premature infants (sometimes referred to as\nstasis nephropathy). In addition to prematurity, nephrocalcinosis can be manifestations of diseases,\nincluding primary hyperoxaluria, distal renal tubular acidosis, glucose-galactose malabsorption,\nBartter syndrome, Williams syndrome, and hereditary hypercalciuria with hypophosphatemic rickets.\nThere are multiple risk factors for nephrocalcinosis in premature infants (Table ).\nTable. Risk Factors for Nephrocalcinosis in Premature Infants\nWhite race\nMale sex\nFamily history of kidney stone\nHypercalciuria\nHyperoxaluria (primary or secondary to gastrointestinal issues)\nAcidosis\nHigh calcium intake\nLow phosphorus intake\nTotal parenteral nutrition\nFurosemide\nCaffeine/theophylline\nGlucocorticoids\nNephrotoxins (eg, gentamicin)\nFirst, low urinary flow rates in premature infants allow for stasis. A second major factor is that urinary\ncalcium excretion is higher in preterm infants. Calcium in the body is distributed between bone and\nextracellular (serum) and intracellular spaces. A total of 99% of calcium in the body is in the bones.\nGrowth and bone accretion require net positive accumulation of calcium, from 0.9% of body weight at\nbirth to 2% of body weight in the adult. This correlates with a positive calcium balance of 150 to 200\nmg/d. The extracellular calcium concentration and total body calcium balance is regulated by\nabsorption and secretion in the gut, bone formation or reabsorption, and urinary calcium excretion.\nCalcium is actively transported across the placenta during fetal development, with most occurring in\nthe third trimester. Intestinal calcium absorption is higher in infants (40%-80%) vs adults (20%-25%).\nPremature infants received high calcium (and phosphorus) formulas, which are risk factors for\nnephrocalcinosis. In extracellular plasma, 40% to 45% of calcium is protein bound, predominantly by\nalbumin. Only unbound calcium or calcium salts are filtered by the glomerulus. Binding of calcium is\npH dependent, and acidosis decreases bound calcium. Acidosis is also a risk factor for\nnephrocalcinosis associated with prematurity. This may be in part caused by the effects of acidosis\n\non increasing the filtered calcium load. Acidosis may also stimulate calcium release from bone to act\nas a buffer. Finally, acidosis may decrease urinary citrate (a stone inhibitor) excretion.\nIn the adult kidney, approximately 65% of calcium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, 25% in the\nTAL, 8% in the distal tubule, and approximately 2% is excreted. In the proximal tubule, calcium\nreabsorption occurs paracellularly driven by sodium and hydrogen exchanger (NHE3) reabsorption.\nThis absorption is influenced by claudins, which determine the permeability of the proximal tubule to\ncalcium. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) inhibits NHE3 and can therefore affect calcium excretion.\nClaudins 16 and 19 are the major regulators of paracellular permeability of the TAL to calcium. Loss-\nof-function mutations in the genes for claudins 16 and 19 are associated with familial\nhypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. Elevated interstitial calcium activates the\nbasolateral calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). The activated CaSR inhibits the NKCC2 cotransporter\nand modulates claudins, thereby diminishing calcium reabsorption in states of hypercalcemia.\nIn contrast, PTH stimulates calcium reabsorption in the TAL (Figure ).\nFigure. Furosemide effects on calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle.\nIn the distal convoluted tubule and connecting duct, there is transcellular reabsorption of calcium.\nCalcium enters via apical TRPV5 channels, binds intracellular calbindin D-28k, and exits via the\nbasolateral sodium-calcium exchanger or via calcium adenosine triphosphatase. TRPV5 expression\nis increased by 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D and PTH, thereby increasing calcium reabsorption. In the\ncollecting duct, there are minimal effects on calcium excretion, but apical calcium-sensing–like\nreceptors inhibit water reabsorption and stimulate acidification in the setting of high urinary calcium,\nwhich may serve to prevent urinary stone formation.\nMany medications, including furosemide, caffeine, and glucocorticoids, are risk factors for\nnephrocalcinosis because of their effects on increasing urinary calcium excretion. Some studies\nindicate furosemide is one the most important contributors to nephrocalcinosis. Caffeine and\ntheophylline likely increase urinary calcium excretion because of their diuretic (increased filtered\ncalcium) and natriuretic effects.\n\nPREP Pearls\n Nephrocalcinosis is a common complication of prematurity.\n Paracellular absorption of calcium in the thick ascending limb is dependent on the sodium reabsorption via the\nthe furosemide sensitive NKCC2 cotransporter.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the importance of furosemide as a risk factor for neonatal calcium-containing stones and\nnephrocalcinosis\nSuggested Readings\n Edvardsson VO, Goldfarb DS, Lieske JC, et al.

    "explanation": "B. daclizumab and basiliximab bind to the interleukin 2 receptor\nThe most correct statement about the mechanism of action of the immunosuppressive agents\nmentioned in the vignette is that daclizumab and basiliximab bind to the interleukin 2 receptor.\nBelatacept does not target the CD40–CD40 ligand pathway, mycophenolate and azathioprine do not\ntarget the CD52 receptor, and cyclosporine and tacrolimus do not bind to the same binding protein.\nUse of multiple agents with different targets allows for enhanced overall immunosuppressive potency\nwhile limiting each agent’s individual toxicity. The original agents used were total body irradiation, 6-\nmercaptopurine, and corticosteroids. Later agents are more focused on inhibiting the interaction\nbetween the antigen-presenting cell and the T cell, typically the activation process of the CD4 T cell.\nThe agent 6-mercaptopurine, its later derivative azathioprine, and the unrelated agents\nmycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolate sodium all act as anti–T-cell proliferative agents, inhibiting\nDNA synthesis.\nThe calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus both act to inhibit a downstream molecule\ncalcineurin that eventually acts on the promoter region of the IL2 gene involved in T-cell activation.\nHowever, they initially bind to different intracellular proteins (tacrolimus binds to FK-binding protein,\nwhereas cyclosporine binds to cyclophilin) before converging toward calcineurin. Conversely,\nsirolimus initially binds to the same intracellular protein as tacrolimus, the FK-binding protein, but then\ndiverges to inhibit a separate pathway, known as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which\nthen inhibits cell cycling.\nCorticosteroids also inhibit IL2 gene activation by multiple mechanisms and are believed to have\nadditional undiscovered mechanisms of immunosuppressive action.\nStarting with the development of antilymphocyte globulin at the University of Minnesota, several\nbiologic agents have been developed that target either multiple epitopes on immune cells (polyclonal\nagents such as horse- or rabbit-derived antithymocyte globulins) or specific single epitopes on\nimmune cells (monoclonal agents such as the older OKT3 and more recent basiliximab, daclizumab,\nand alemtuzumab). These agents are typically administered as prophylaxis in the early perioperative\nperiod or as rescue agents in the treatment of rejection. Rituximab targets the CD20 receptor on the\nB cell and can be used as prophylaxis or rescue therapy.\nMore recently, belatacept was developed as a costimulatory blockade agent, blocking the CD28-B7\npathway. Unlike other biologic injectables, this agent acts as a maintenance drug being administered\nmonthly. Drugs that target other costimulatory pathways, such as the CD40-CD40 ligand, have been\ntried or are in development. Each drug and its target are shown in the Figure.\n\nFigure: Mechanisms of action Courtesy of V. Dharnidharka\nMany of these same drugs are also used in native kidney disease, especially in glomerular diseases\nthat are believed to have some component of immune dysregulation. Thus, cyclosporine, tacrolimus,\nazathioprine, mycophenolate, mTOR inhibitors, corticosteroids, and rituximab have all been used in\none or more glomerular diseases. Cyclophosphamide, not mentioned previously, is another agent\nthat has been used in primary glomerular disease. It is an alkylating agent that binds to and cross-\nlinks DNA, thus interfering with DNA replication.\nPREP Pearls\n Transplant professionals use multiple immunosuppressive agents to suppress the immune rejection response.\n Use of multiple agents with different targets allows for enhanced overall immunosuppressive potency while\nlimiting each agent’s individual toxicity.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the mechanisms of action of immunosuppressive drugs used to treat kidney disease\nSuggested Readings\n Sayegh, MH, Turka, LA.The role of T-cell costimulatory activation pathways in transplant rejection.

The suppressed\nparathyroid hormone with normal alkaline phosphatase and normal vitamin D levels render\nautonomous hyperparathyroidism, paraneoplastic hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone–related\npeptide, or granulomatous diseases unlikely as the cause of the hypercalcemia. It turned out that the\npatient was taking calcium carbonate between meals. Calcium-containing phosphorus binders are\nknown to act as calcium supplements when they are not taken together with meals and may lead to\nhypercalcemia. Combined with initiating calcitriol therapy, which enhances gastrointestinal absorption\nof calcium, this aggravated her hypercalcemia.\nHypercalcemia is a common complication of calcium-containing phosphate binders, especially in\ncombination with vitamin D supplements. In addition, her vitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels\nare in the reference range and will not lead to hypercalcemia. Nonadherence with her diet and\nmedications would likely lead to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Although undiagnosed\npyelonephritis leading to further renal damage is unlikely, it could be a contributing factor and could\nbe asymptomatic but would not cause hypercalcemia.\nHypercalcemia causes multisystem disturbance and symptoms, which include the following.\nRenal\nThe most important renal manifestations are polyuria, resulting from decreased concentrating ability\nin the distal tubule, nephrolithiasis, and acute kidney injury. Long-standing hypercalcemia and\nhypercalciuria may lead to calcification, degeneration, and necrosis of the tubular cells and eventual\ntubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis and calcification (nephrocalcinosis).\nGastrointestinal\nGastrointestinal symptoms, such as constipation, anorexia, and nausea, occur\ncommonly. Constipation may be related to decreased smooth muscle tone and/or abnormal\nautonomic function. Pancreatitis and peptic ulcer disease occur less frequently than other\ngastrointestinal symptoms. Proposed mechanisms for the development of pancreatitis include\ndeposition of calcium in the pancreatic duct and calcium activation of trypsinogen within the\npancreatic parenchyma.\nCardiovascular\nHypertension and cardiomyopathy can be complications of acute hypercalcemia. High serum calcium\ncan directly shorten the myocardial action potential, which is reflected in a shortened QT interval.\nAlthough there does not appear to be any clinically important effect of moderate hypercalcemia on\ncardiac conduction or the prevalence of supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias in patients with\nprimary hyperparathyroidism, arrhythmia has been described in patients with severe hypercalcemia.\nIn addition, ST-segment elevation mimicking myocardial infarction has been reported in such patients.\nLong-standing hypercalcemia, as occurs in primary hyperparathyroidism, can lead to other cardiac\nabnormalities, including deposition of calcium in heart valves, coronary arteries and myocardial fibers,\nhypertension, and cardiomyopathy.\nMuscular\n\nProfound muscle weakness was prominent in the original description of patients with primary\nhyperparathyroidism. In one prospective study, for example, 9 patients were tested for neuromuscular\nperformance before and 4 weeks after parathyroid surgery. All had an increase in muscle strength\nand improvement in fine motor movement, whereas there was no change in patients who did not\nundergo surgery. Weakness can be an important feature of other causes of hypercalcemia, such as\nmalignant tumors, but this can be a manifestation of the underlying illness rather than from\nhypercalcemia alone.\nNeuropsychiatric\nA number of mild neuropsychiatric disturbances have been associated with hypercalcemia, mostly in\npatients with primary hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia. The most common symptoms have\nbeen anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction. Improvement in some or all of these symptoms\nhas been described after correction of the hypercalcemia.\nPREP Pearls\n The most important renal manifestations of acute hypercalcemia are polyuria, resulting from decreased\nconcentrating ability in the distal tubule, nephrolithiasis, hypertension, and acute and acute on chronic renal\ninsufficiency.\n Long-standing hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria may lead to calcification, degeneration, and necrosis of the\ntubular cells and eventual tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis and calcification (nephrocalcinosis).\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia\nSuggested Readings\n Schiller LR, Santa Ana CA, Sheikh MS, Emmett M, Fordtran JS.

    "explanation": "B. blood group B\nFor the male patient described in the vignette, the most likely reason for a longer waiting time for him\nis his blood group B status. The male child weighs 18 kg so should easily accept any size kidney,\nwhich is no different than for the 21-kg girl. Being a boy or having an appendicovesicostomy does not\naffect the chance of a donor kidney offer. Finally, the deceased donor listing has an inherent\nunpredictability, which can affect the timing of an offer.\nThe National Organ Transplant Act in 1984 established the creation of the Organ Procurement\nTransplant Network (OPTN) in 1988 in the United States. The OPTN, set up by a private agency\nunder federal contract, then developed the following systems:\n1. A national listing of deceased donor solid organs available for transplant (not just kidneys)\n2. A national listing of people with end-stage organ failure, awaiting a deceased donor organ\ntransplant, known as candidate recipients\n3. A national tissue typing and histocompatibility system to match the donor kidneys with the\ncandidate recipients\n4. A national allocation system for each solid organ because the number of candidate recipients\nexceeded the number of available deceased donor organs\n5. A registry to track results of all solid organ transplants performed in the United States\nFor people with end-stage kidney disease, the options for renal replacement therapy include long-\nterm home or in-center dialysis or a living donor or deceased donor kidney transplant. Note that\nOPTN does not facilitate living donor transplants, although it tracks the results of living donor\ntransplants. Once a transplant evaluation is complete, a candidate recipient can be listed with OPTN\nfor a deceased donor kidney. The listing can be under active or inactive (temporary or extended, as in\ncase of recent infection or immunization) status.\nUnder active status, a candidate recipient may receive an offer at anytime. This offer is made based\non (1) compatibility of donor and candidate blood groups; (2) a virtual tissue typing comparing the\nHLA antigen profiles of each, which can also suggest (3) a likely negative crossmatch; and (4) the\npriority score. Priority is assigned based on a number of factors, including antibody sensitization,\nmultiorgan need, and zero antigen mismatch. Children currently receive preference for the best-\nquality kidneys, graded by a Kidney Donor Profile Index score.\nOnce the candidate has been called in for a potential transplant, donor cells are then mixed with\nrecipient serum in a laboratory crossmatch. The donor organ is usually being retrieved at this time.\nA positive crossmatch result or damaged retrieved organ may lead to a cancellation of the transplant,\nwith the patient being put back on the waiting list.\nAt the time of this writing, the deceased donor waitlist far exceeds the actual organ supply\n(https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov). For adults, the average waiting time on the list is 3 to 4 years\n(and can be longer in certain geographic areas). For children younger than 18 years at the time of\nlisting, the goal is to have the child receive a kidney transplant within 6 months of listing. Blood group\nB is proportionately overrepresented on the deceased donor wait list compared with blood group A.\nThus, blood group B candidates have a longer average wait for a kidney transplant. In contrast, the\nsex of the donor/candidate recipient or the primary kidney disease do not count in any way toward the\npotential to receive an offer. Similarly, the need or not for a urologist at transplant surgery would not\n\ncount in terms of when a donor kidney offer might come. Note that the presence of an\nappendicovesicostomy should not be construed as either a contraindication for receiving a donor\nkidney offer or a need for a urologist being present at the time of the transplant surgery.\nIn the distant past, very small kidney candidate recipients (body weight <15 kg) would receive size-\nmatched kidneys from very young donors (also with body weight <15 kg), similar to the current\npractice for heart, lung, and liver. However, this practice was discontinued in kidney transplants\nbecause of the excessively high thrombosis rates in such pairings. The current practice in kidney is to\nnot size match because the kidney can be placed elsewhere in the abdomen and enough free space\nexists in the abdomen to fit an adult kidney into a child longer than 65 cm or weighing more than 7.5\nkg. A very young donor kidney (body weight <15 kg) would then be offered en bloc to an adult\ncandidate.\nPREP Pearls\n The deceased donor list is a national system to list candidates awaiting a kidney transplant.\n The deceased donor list also matches the candidate with the donor organ.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the concept of the deceased donor renal transplant waiting list\nSuggested Readings\n Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.

    "explanation": "C. 7.8 times higher\nIn the vignette, you are asked to estimate the chance of an exposure in patients with a disorder from\na subset of data given, in effect conducting a case-control analysis. The appropriate statistical\nanalysis would be the calculation of the odds ratio (OR) or the odds of exposure in cases compared\nwith the odds of exposure in controls. From the given vignette data, the odds of exposure in cases is\n9.0 (18/2). The odds of exposure in controls is 1.14 (32/28). The ratio of these 2 odds values\n(9.0/1.14 or ad/bc) is 7.8 or the OR and gives you the appropriate measure of association between\nthe exposure and the disorder of interest in case-control studies. If this data set were complete with\nall the patients seen, then one may conduct a cohort or cross-sectional study and calculate the\ndegree of association using the relative risk (RR). That calculation would have yielded the value of\n5.4 but is not the correct calculation to undertake for this type of study.\nIn the vignette, you are asked to assess the risk of a certain exposure (antenatal steroids) to the\noccurrence of a disease (neonatal hypertension) as a means of estimating association between that\nexposure and the disease in question. This can be measured in different ways, depending on the type\nof study being conducted. In the described scenario, you are conducting a case-control study\nbecause you have preliminarily identified those with the disease (hypertension) and are comparing\nthem with those without the disease to determine whether there are any factors (antenatal steroid\nexposure) that may be associated with increased risk. This type of study contrasts with cohort\nstudies, in which the exposure is what is first identified and the development of a condition or disease\nis then assessed, often over a protracted period. This study also contrasts with cross-sectional\nstudies, in which both the exposure and condition are assessed for at the same point in time.\nTypically, the differences in these types of studies are clear based on the way they are conducted,\nwith case-control studies being conducted retrospectively often with few cases identified, cohort\nstudies often having the cohort identified first and followed up prospectively, and cross-sectional\nstudies being analyzed at one point in time. Although these differences seem subtle in context to the\ndata set that is given in this scenario, there is one great difference among these types of studies: the\nknown incidence of disease in the population being studied and, subsequently, in the type of\nstatistical analysis that can be performed. In a case-control study, the true incidence of the disease in\nthe population may be unknown. For example, this neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may average\n200 admissions a year, yet the given data set for 5 years contains information on only 80 patients.\nTherefore, the true incidence of hypertension in this entire population is not known because the data\nare not complete. However, this limitation does not restrict the utility of case-control study data. To\naccount for the unknown true incidence of disease in a case-control study, one must use an OR to\nmeasure the association between exposure and outcome.\nTo clarify the concept of odds and OR, it may be easier to visualize things through the 2 × 2 table that\nis often used in biostatistics (shown below)\nCondition or Disease Present Condition or Disease Absent\nExposure present a b a + b\nExposure absent c d c + d\na + c b + d\n\nwhere a represents those patients with both the disease and the exposure, b represents those\nwithout disease but with the exposure, c represents those with the disease but without the exposure,\nand d represents those without disease or exposure. Subsequently, a + c represents all who have\nthe disease or all the cases, whereas b + d would represent all those without the disease or the\ncontrols; a + b represents all those exposed, whereas c + d represents all those not exposed.\nThe concept of odds is really a proportion of probabilities and is often easiest thought of in relation to\ngambling or gaming. Let’s say that a certain amateur sports team is heavily favored to win a match,\nwith their probability of winning being 95%. The probability of them NOT winning would then be only\n5%. The odds of them winning would be the proportion of these 2 probabilities:\nOdds (Winning) = Probability of Winning/Probability of Not Winning = 95%/5% = 19 to 1\nThe difficulty in understanding odds is that the numerator (top number of the fraction) and the\ndenominator (bottom number) should reciprocate each other so that their sum is 100%, or 1 if using\ndecimals. This will help ensure that you are using the correct probabilities to calculate the odds of\nwhat you are measuring.\nFor our given example, one may first ask what are the odds of being exposed (to antenatal steroids)\nin individuals who have the disease or cases (NICU patients who develop hypertension). This would\nbe the probability of those developing hypertension with the exposure divided by the probability of\nthose with hypertension NOT having the exposure because we are looking at only those individuals\nwho developed hypertension. Mathematically, this would be expressed as follows:\nIn this particular vignette, the odds of receiving antenatal steroids if developing hypertension would be\n18/20 divided by 2/20, simplified to 18/2 (a/c) or 9.0. This number is rather high but does not\nrepresent the true risk of the exposure because most patients in this data set received the exposure\n(50 of 80) possibly because they had other risk factors, such as prematurity or low birth weight, which\nmay also put them at risk for developing hypertension. This simply represents the odds of being\nexposed only in those patients who have the disease.\nTo evaluate the full association of the exposure and the disease of interest, you must compare the\nodds of exposure in cases, or those with the disease, with the odds of exposure in controls, or those\nwithout the disease. This is the question being asked by the fellow, and it is answered by the OR,\nalso called the relative odds. The OR would be the ratio of the odds (disease given exposure) over\nthe odds (no disease given exposure). Mathematically, this would be expressed as\nfollows:\nSimply applying the numbers given in this vignette, ad/bc would be 18 × 28/2 × 32 or 504/64, which is\njust below 8, technically 7.8.\nThe generated values of an OR will always be a positive value but may be less than 1, close to 1, or\nsignificantly higher than 1. An OR less than 1 means that the odds of exposure in cases are lower\n\nthan controls and the exposure may be protective of developing disease. An OR near 1 means that\nthe odds of exposure are nearly the same between cases and controls and, likely, the exposure is not\nassociated with the disease. An OR greater than 1 would mean that the exposure is greater among\ncases and the exposure may be a risk factor for the disease.\nIn the vignette, the odds of exposure to antenatal steroids in those without hypertension would be\n32/60 divided by 28/60, simplified to 32/28 (b/d) or approximately 1.14. This is greater than 1, so one\nmay jump to the conclusion that the exposure to steroids would technically also increase your\nlikelihood of NOT having hypertension. This is not the case because we are looking merely at the\nodds, not the OR, of exposure in controls. The odds of exposure are high among controls and the\ncases in this scenario because there is a very high percentage of all patients in the data set having\nthe exposure. However, regardless of the actual incidence of exposure, the OR may be used.\nThe OR may be used in other types of studies, although they are the only statistic used for case-\ncontrol studies, as well as being used in logistic regression. An OR may be calculated for cohort and\ncross-sectional studies as well. In the vignette, if the data being collected were that of a total cohort\nstudy, not a case-control study, then one would calculate the RR to answer the question of what\nadditional risk of developing hypertension does the receipt of antenatal steroids provide to infants in\nthe NICU. Using the same data from the 2 × 2 table would give us the following:\nIn this case, the RR of 5.4 does not equal the calculated an OR of 7.8 because the disease incidence\nis not that rare.\nLastly, ORs are also used in logistic regression. The regression coefficient, often symbolized as b1 in\nthe regression formula, is the estimated increase in odds of developing the disease (although it is\nraised exponentially or eb1) associated with a 1-unit increase in the exposure. For example, if you\nwere looking at the risk of hypertension developing based on grams of sodium in your diet and the\nlogistic regression yielded a regression coefficient value of 0.68, then someone consuming 4 g of\nsodium would have an e0.68 (which calculates to 1.97) or almost twice the risk of developing\nhypertension.\nPREP Pearls\n The odds ratio, which is calculated from a 2 × 2 table as (a × d)/(b × c), is the appropriate statistic to use in\ncase-control studies.\n In cohort studies, the relative risk often may be approximated by the odds ratio when there is a very low\nincidence of disease.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Calculate and interpret an odds ratio\nSuggested Readings\n Gordis L.

It is caused by deficiency of α-\ngalactosidase A (GAL) attributable to mutations in the GLA gene. Reduced GAL activity is diagnostic\nin males, but confirmatory genotyping is recommended. Because of skewing of X inactivation in\nfemales, they may also develop Fabry disease. The median age of symptoms is 6 years in males and\n9 years in affected females. The earliest reported signs and symptoms are listed in the Table.\nTable Pediatric signs and symptoms of Fabry Disease\nSome affected females may have nondiagnostic levels of blood GAL activity and require genotyping\nfor definitive diagnosis. Genotyping is important for prediction of disease severity and to help guide\ndecisions on when to consider enzyme replacement therapy. It is also the preferred modality for\nscreening family members.\nThe patient described in the vignette has signs (angiokeratomas and chronic kidney disease) and\nsymptoms (acroparesthesias and gastrointestinal issues) of Fabry disease with a positive family\nhistory for Fabry disease. After she is confirmed by genotyping to have Fabry disease, the current\nrecommendations are that symptomatic females be considered for enzyme replacement therapy. In\nwomen with Fabry disease, the rates of complications may be similar to men, especially for cardiac\ndisease. Cerebrovascular events, such as stroke, may even be more common.\nMale patients may develop microalbuminuria or proteinuria as early as 7 years of age, and more than\nhalf will have it by their middle 30s. End-stage kidney disease in males typically develops by 50 years\nof age.\nEnzyme therapy has been available for more than a dozen years. It consists of intravenous infusion\nof galactosidase beta or galactosidase alfa (not available in the United States) enzyme. In\n\nrandomized trials of galactosidase beta or galactosidase alfa vs controls, there have been no\nsignificant differences in the rate of death. Statistical improvement in pain scores has been\ndemonstrated vs placebo. In children, enzyme replacement therapy has been reported to improve\nschool performance, increase energy levels, and decrease pain. In addition to these quality-of-life\nmeasures, clearance of GL3 from podocytes has been demonstrated with enzyme therapy. Stopping\ntherapy leads to renewed accumulation of GL3.\nOverall, in trials between the 2 forms of enzyme therapy, there has been no difference in adverse\nevents. The enzyme infusions are generally well tolerated. There have been statistically significant\nincreases in rigors and fever with galactosidase beta compared with placebo. However,\npremedication is not usually used for galactosidase alfa, whereas it is used for galactosidase beta\n(antipyretic and/or antihistamine). The enzymes may be given by injection every 1 to 2 weeks;\nhowever, the optimal regimen for dose and timing have not been defined.\nIn children, the complications of therapies may include the complications of weekly or every-other-\nweek infusions (venous access, school and social interruptions, and medicalization of the child). In\naddition, there are some infusion-related reactions as mentioned above. Development of IgG\nantibodies has been described against either enzyme, and 1 case of symptomatic IgE antibody\ndirected against galactosidase beta has been described in a highly atopic patient.\nOther clinical evaluations would include electrocardiography, echocardiography, and formal\nglomerular filtration rate assessment if available.

    "explanation": "C. less radiation exposure\nFor the child described in the vignette, who may potentially require serial imaging because of the risk\nof recurrent symptomatic nephrolithiasis, the advantages of using intravenous pyelography (IVP) is\nthat it delivers less overall radiation exposure compared with computed tomography (CT). It may also\nprovide better imaging of the upper urinary tract to assess intraluminal changes and degree of urinary\ntract distention and tortuosity. However, IVP does NOT detect stones in the urinary tract better than\nCT and, in fact, is worse in detecting stones in the lower ureters and ureterovesical junction. IVP also\ndoes NOT provide superior imaging of the parenchyma because it very easily misses small (<3 cm)\nmasses and cannot make any distinguishment of areas without contrast uptake. Lastly, IVP use is\nlimited to patients who are able to receive intravenous contrast media, so it should NOT be performed\nin individuals with significantly reduced renal function.\nIVP, also more appropriately termed intravenous urography or excretory urography, was the primary\nmethod of imaging the urinary tract for several decades before the advent of cross-sectional\nimaging. Its use has largely been supplanted by ultrasonography, CT, and magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) of the urinary tract in the United States, but IVP is still used in many other areas of the\nworld because of its relatively low cost and convenience. However, despite its diminished use, there\nare still some indications for the use of IVP in place of these other imaging modalities (Table ).\nBecause IVP is used so infrequently in the United States, most physicians (both radiologists and\nnephrologists) who were trained in the last 20 years are likely unfamiliar with proper test performance\nand result interpretation so do not understand its utility, limitations, and contraindications. Basically,\nan IVP is a sequence of X-rays of the abdomen immediately before and after the administration of\ncontrast media that is taken up and excreted by the kidneys, which allow for imaging of the kidneys,\nureters, and bladder. A preliminary image of the abdomen is performed before administration of any\ncontrast to check positioning and technique while also assessing for the presence of radiopaque\nitems, such as urinary calculi. Further images are then taken 1 to 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after the\nadministration of intravenous contrast. The first (1 to 3 minutes) postcontrast image is generally\ncentered on the expected location of the kidneys and provides an overall view of the kidney size,\nshape, and functioning tissue, as the renal parenchyma takes up contrast. At 5 minutes after contrast\nadministration, contrast should then start to collect in the upper urinary tracts, allowing for an\nevaluation of the renal calyces, pelvises, and upper ureters. This allows for an outline of the upper\nurinary tract lumens, including any evidence of urinary tract dilation or absence of contrast within the\nlumen from an obstruction. If there are no contraindications to abdominal compression, this is often\ndone between 5 and 10 minutes after contrast administration because this allows for optimal\ndistention and opacification of the ureters to provide greatest detail with the 10-minute postcontrast\nimages. Lastly, images performed 15 minutes after contrast administration should provide detailed\noutline of the lower urinary tract and bladder. Therefore, IVP provides imaging of the entire upper\nurinary tract to the bladder, with additional images taken from different angles (oblique, lateral, etc) or\n\ndifferent points in time, thus providing complete imaging of the intraluminal urinary tract. In addition,\nIVP can provide information regarding urine transit over time, such as delayed excretion from renal\ninjury or obstruction that is not captured in the single moment in time of cross-sectional imaging.\nThe American College of Radiology cites the different indications of IVP, specifically noting its use in\nthe evaluation of suspected or known ureteral obstruction or the follow-up of patients with recurrent\nrenal or ureteral calculi. The former indication is because IVP can provide outstanding delineation of\nnot only the level at which there is obstruction but also the contour and degree of distention of the\nurinary tract above the obstruction, which may be needed information for the intervening\nsurgeon. IVP, however, does not necessarily provide information on the cause of obstruction,\nespecially if it is from something extrinsically compressing the urinary tract rather than an intraluminal\nblockage. In addition, because IVP relies on radiography for the detection of urolithiasis,\nradiographically lucent stones may not be easily detected on IVP. Although the findings of\nobstruction, if present, would be seen, the cause of obstruction may not be as apparent. A\ncomparison of noncontrast CT and IVP revealed that noncontrast CT had a higher detection rate of\nany urinary tract stones (73% vs 51%) but especially greater detection when stones were present in\nthe distal ureter and ureterovesical junction. Therefore, IVP does NOT provide better detection of\nstones throughout the urinary tract when compared with noncontrast CT.\nThe cited indication of IVP in the follow-up of patients with recurrent calculi is solely because of the\nreduced patient radiation exposure when compared with CT. Noncontrast CT has a radiation dosage\n(4.5 mSv) 3 times greater than standard IVP. Therefore, in patients likely to require multiple radiologic\nprocedures, such as those at high risk of recurrent renal calculi like the family members with oxalate\nstone risk in the vignette, the use of IVP is preferred to reduce their lifetime exposure to radiation.\nAnother cited indication for IVP use includes situations in which cross-sectional imaging was thought\nto place the patient at risk, such as intraoperative assessments in patients who are clinically unstable\nfor CT or MRI.\nOther potential indications for IVP are dependent on the given reason for imaging. Because IVP can\nprovide greater information about the urinary collecting system, it may provide superior imaging of the\ncalyces and renal pelvis. Thus, it would be the preferred study if evaluating for sloughed renal\npapillae, medullary sponge kidney, or transitional cell carcinoma. However, cross-sectional imaging,\nspecifically CT, outperforms IVP when assessing for abnormalities of the renal parenchyma. IVP\nassesses only where the kidneys take up the contrast material, so it will show areas of intact\nparenchyma. If an area of injured (or absent) parenchyma is small, it may not be detected easily by\nIVP if the surrounding tissue is taking up contrast material. In fact, small renal masses (<3 cm in\ndiameter) can easily be missed on IVP, although they would be easily detected by other cross-\nsectional imaging. In addition, IVP cannot tell you anything about the “abnormal” tissue in the kidney\nthat does not take up the contrast, for example, whether it is solid like a mass or fluid filled like a cyst,\nonly that it is an area devoid of working parenchyma, whereas cross-sectional imaging is able to give\nmore useful information about areas of abnormal findings.\nIVP is only useful for imaging the urinary tract, so it has very little utility for detecting abnormalities\noutside the urinary collecting system, whereas CT or MRI can detect abnormalities outside the urinary\ncollecting system. Therefore, IVP would not be recommended as first-choice imaging to evaluate less\nspecific symptoms, such as abdominal or back pain, where cross-sectional imaging would.\nThere are other limitations to using IVP besides its confined use to imaging of the urinary tract, which\nmay also restrict its utility. Because its images are contingent on the use of iodinated contrast media,\nIVP may not be used in conditions in which the use of such media is contraindicated. This would\ninclude restriction in individuals with known allergy to contrast medium or who have a strong history of\natopy or severe asthma because patients with these conditions have a higher likelihood of developing\n\nsevere allergic reactions to contrast. Patients with severe heart failure (including significant aortic\nstenosis or pulmonary hypertension) should also avoid intravenous contrast media exposure because\nthe hyperosmolar fluid volume may not be tolerated. Patients with moderately decreased renal\nfunction (glomerular filtration rate [GFR], 30-59 mL/min) and taking metformin should discontinue use\nof their metformin use for more than 24 hours before receiving intravenous contrast because this\nmedication often can interact with the contrast to impair renal function. Similarly, patients with\nseverely decreased renal function (GFR, <30 mL/min) should not receive contrast media because of\nthe risk of further impairment from contrast nephropathy. In patients with these conditions, cross-\nsectional imaging, such as noncontrast CT or MRI, may be preferred because images may still be\nobtained without the use of contrast. In addition, there is a risk of extravasation of intravenous\ncontrast, similar to when being used for CT, and local skin breakdown.\nOutside contraindications to receiving contrast media, the only other complications associated with\nIVP use are related to performing abdominal compression during the study. Compression is intended\nto distend the ureters by compressing them against the sacrum as they traverse across the ala.\nCompression is not recommended in patients with evidence of urinary tract obstruction, recent\nabdominal surgery, known urinary tract trauma, abdominal masses (such as aortic aneurysm), or\nurinary diversions because the increased intra-abdominal pressure may cause further harm. In fact,\nsevere flank pain after applying compression may indicate rupture of a renal fornix. Lastly, pregnancy\nis also considered a contraindication to having IVP performed because of both the risk of\ncompression and the exposure to radiation, even though at lower doses compared with CT.\nPREP Pearls\n Intravenous pyelography, when properly performed, can provide a great deal of information about the kidneys,\nureter, and bladder. It can provide detailed imaging of the renal calyces, pelvis, and ureters and may be the\npreferred imaging for papillary necrosis or medullary sponge kidney.\n Intravenous pyelography does not provide superior imaging of the renal parenchyma, compared with cross-\nsectional imaging, and does not provide any imaging outside the renal collecting system, so its use should be\ntailored toward very specific clinical questions.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the indications for and limitations and complications of intravenous pyelography\nSuggested Readings\n American College of Radiology Practice Parameter for the Performance of Excretory\nUrography. http://www.acr.org/~/media/795e1f28877844518b722e564a9a3de9.pdf.

    "explanation": "B. muscle weakness\nHyperkalemia is usually defined as a serum or plasma potassium level greater than 5.5 mEq/L (5.5\nmmol/L). Although children are less likely to develop hyperkalemia than adults, pediatric\nhyperkalemia is not an uncommon occurrence, and severe hyperkalemia (potassium level >7.0\nmEq/L [>7.0 mmol/L]) is a serious medical problem that needs immediate attention.\nNot all children with hyperkalemia will manifest electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, and the\nabsence of ECG change does not preclude the need for potential therapy for significant elevations in\npotassium concentration. Hyperdynamic reflexes, restlessness, and tetany are not associated with\nhyperkalemia.\nThe symptoms of hyperkalemia are variable. Most children are asymptomatic if they have mild (<6\nmEq/L [<6 mmol/L]) or moderate elevations of potassium concentrations (6.0-7.0 mEq/L [6.0-7.0\nmmol/L]). In these patients, hyperkalemia is typically detected when plasma or serum electrolytes are\nobtained for monitoring or because electrolyte abnormalities are suspected. This typically occurs in\nchildren with signs or symptoms of renal disease, such as hypertension; urinary abnormalities,\nincluding hematuria and proteinuria, edema, and oliguria/anuria; significantly decreased effective\narterial blood flow, including shock, severe gastroenteritis, or heart failure; and trauma.\nChildren with severe hyperkalemia (potassium level >7 mEq/L [>7 mmol/L]) may have several clinical\nmanifestations. Muscle weakness or paralysis is usually ascending, beginning in the legs and\nprogressing to the trunk and arms, which can progress to flaccid paralysis. These findings may mimic\nthose seen in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Children with significant hyperkalemia may have\nsymptoms of cardiac conduction abnormalities, including palpitations, syncope, or asystole,\ndepending on the severity of cardiac conduction disturbances.\nSignificant hyperkalemia is associated with potentially life-threatening disturbances in cardiac\nconduction. ECG changes reflect the effect of increasing levels of serum and plasma potassium on\nthe electrical activity of the heart, including aberrant atrial (P wave) and ventricular (QRS complex)\ndepolarization and abnormal repolarization (T wave). These findings are based not only on the level\nof extracellular potassium but also on how quickly the change in potassium level has occurred over\ntime. ECG changes that generally occur at a concentration greater than 7 mEq/L (>7 mmol/L) in\nchildren with chronic hyperkalemia may be seen at lower levels in children with an acute rapid\nincrease in potassium concentration, resulting in a swift decrease in the transmembrane potassium\ngradient. This may be seen in patients with tumor lysis or significant crush injury. In infants, ECG\nchanges are usually seen at greater levels of potassium because the reference range is higher in this\ngroup of patients.\nThe following is the general range of serum and plasma potassium levels and the corresponding ECG\nchanges.\n 5.5 to 6.5 mEq/L (5.5-6.5 mmol/L) and tall peaked T waves with a narrow base and shortening of the\nQT interval as shown in waveform 1 below\n 6.5 to 8.0 mEq/L (6.5-8.0 mmol/L) and peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, decreased or\ndisappearing P wave, widening QRS complex, and amplified R wave as shown in waveform 2 below\n Greater than 8.0 mEq/L (>8.0 mmol/L) and absent P wave, bundle branch block, progressive widening\nof QRS complex that eventually merges with the T wave to form a sinusoidal pattern followed by\nventricular fibrillation or asystole\n\nPREP Pearls\n Physical finding of hyperkalemia are absent to mild if the potassium level is mildly elevated.\n Physical finding of hyperkalemia include ascending muscle weakness and paralysis.\n Cardiac arrhythmias can occur with hyperkalemia.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia\nSuggested Readings\n Kim M, Somers MJG.

    "explanation": "D. sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium chloride supplementation\nThe patient described in the vignette is a newborn with persistently elevated potassium and extremely\nhigh aldosterone levels that did not respond to volume expansion with saline. An elevated potassium\nlevel at this age could be caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia or an isolated deficiency in\naldosterone synthesis, but the high aldosterone level eliminates these possibilities. One of the\nremaining possibilities is a form of pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA).\nThere are 3 main types of PHA (Table ).\nThis patient has type I PHA. All patients with PHA have hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and an\nelevated blood aldosterone level. In PHA type I and type III, the patients lose sodium.\nIn this patient, the lack of ultrasonography findings makes a type III or secondary PHA unlikely. The\nlack of hypertension and extremely elevated aldosterone level makes Gordon syndrome (PHA type II)\nalso unlikely.\nIn this patient, PHA type I could be the systemic form or a renal limited form. In the systemic form,\nthere can be complications of cholelithiasis, rashes, and lung disease related to reduced sodium-\ndependent liquid absorption. These patients lose salt through their skin and may be diagnosed as\nhaving PHA type I by a sweat test. The salt wasting can be quite severe and in some cases may\nrequire up to 50 mEq/kg daily of sodium supplementation. The systemic form is caused\nby SCNN1A, SCNN1B, or SCNN1G mutations in the epithelial sodium channel in an autosomal\nrecessive fashion. These patients require lifelong salt supplementation and may require symptomatic\ntherapy for respiratory tract illnesses and skin disease.\nRenal limited forms cause milder sodium wasting and may require up to 20 mEq/kg per day of salt\nsupplementation. This is an autosomal dominant disease in the NR3C2 gene (mineralocorticoid\nreceptor). Fortunately, these patients improve with age and usually can be weaned off supplemental\nsodium at approximately 2 years of age.\nIn addition to sodium supplementation, both the renal and systemic forms may require potassium-\nbinding resin and dietary modifications to reduce potassium dietary load. Sodium may be provided\npredominantly as sodium chloride, but sodium bicarbonate may also be needed to correct the\n\nacidosis. These patients often require tube feeding to facilitate administration of specialized feeds at\nhigh volume.\nOnce the diagnosis is made with a high aldosterone level there is no role for mineralocorticoid\nadministration. Although the patient is acidotic, he also has hyperkalemia, and potassium citrate\nwould be contraindicated.\nThe traditional potassium-binding resin in use is sodium polystyrene sulfonate, which is approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration for hyperkalemia, but dosing in neonates has been associated\nwith necrotizing enterocolitis. Oral administration is contraindicated in neonates, especially those with\nreduced gut motility (postoperatively or drug induced). Some centers may also use sodium\npolystyrene sulfonate pretreatment of formula for ex vivo binding of potassium (with subsequent\ndecanting of treated formula from resin).\nMore recently, patiromer has been approved for hyperkalemia in adults. It is a cation exchange\npolymer that contains a calcium-sorbitol anion. It may cause complications by binding some drugs\nand has gastrointestinal issues similar to sodium polystyrene sulfonate. It would not be an appropriate\nchoice because there is no published pediatric experience. In addition, it is sodium free, and patients\nwith PHA type I taking patiromer would need more sodium supplementation than those taking sodium\npolystyrene sulfonate.\nApproximately half of the patients with rare antenatal Bartter syndrome have transient hyperkalemia\nin the newborn period and also hyperaldosteronism. This condition usually follows a pregnancy\ncomplicated by polyhydramnios, and the hyperkalemia usually begins to resolve after a week of age.\nIn addition, there is usually hypercalciuria and early nephrocalcinosis.\nPREP Pearls\n The aldosterone level is the key to segregating the causes of hyperkalemia in the newborn.\n A sweat test can be used to differentiate systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism from renal limited\npseudohypoaldosteronism.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the treatment and the complications of treatment for pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\nSuggested Readings\n Hanukoglu I, Hanukoglu A.

    "explanation": "C. renal tubular acidosis\nFor the patient described in the vignette, the most likely diagnosis is renal tubular acidosis (RTA)\nbecause the patient has hyperchloremic non–anion gap (AG) acidosis. Ingestion of ethylene glycol,\nlactic acidosis from an inborn error of metabolism, and salicylate poisoning are not the likely\ndiagnoses because each of these is associated with elevated AG metabolic acidosis. In addition,\neach of these usually present with significant symptoms and not as growth failure noted during a well-\nchild visit.\nInfants and children with metabolic acidosis can present with varying degrees of severity. Once\nmetabolic acidosis is diagnosed, the next step is to determine whether it is AG metabolic acidosis or\nnon-AG metabolic acidosis. The AG is calculated as the difference between the major cation sodium\n(Na+) and the major measured anions (chlorine [Cl−] and bicarbonate [HCO −]):\n3\nAG = (Na+) − (Cl− + HCO −)\n3\nThe normal mean (SD) AG is 12 (4). An elevated AG is generally due to an increase in unmeasured\nanions, such as lactate, β-hydroxybutyrate, or metabolic products of some ingested poisons\n(methanol, ethylene glycol) in the blood (further discussed below).\nA low AG can be produced by a reduction in unmeasured anions, such as hypoalbuminemia, or an\nincrease in nonsodium cations, such as hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and/or hypermagnesemia.\nNormal AG acidosis is caused by various forms of RTA or extrarenal losses of sodium bicarbonate,\nsuch as gastrointestinal losses.\nOccasionally, children will present with mixed metabolic acidosis (further discussed below).\nCauses of High AG Metabolic Acidosis\nHigh AG metabolic acidosis results from an increase in unmeasured anions, resulting in hydrogen ion\naccumulation in the blood. In children, an AG above 14 to 16 mEq/L (14-16 mmol/L) is considered\nelevated. The important causes of high AG metabolic acidosis in children are listed in Figure 1.\n\nThe most common cause of ketoacidosis in children is diabetic ketoacidosis, which results from\naccumulation of acetoacetic acid and β-hydroxybutyric acid. Other causes include starvation or\nethanol abuse in adults.\nLactic acidosis may result from hypoperfusion due to sepsis, cardiac failure, or severe hypovolemia,\nas well as other causes. Lactic acidosis may occur in neonates with perinatal hypoxemia and\nischemia. Lactic acidosis can occur is some inborn errors of metabolism, particularly mitochondrial\ndisorders.\nUremia is associated with retention of both hydrogen ions and unmeasured anions, such as sulfate,\nphosphate, and urate, which result in increased AG acidosis.\nIngestion of toxic materials, such as ethylene glycol, methanol, or salicylate poisoning, is a cause of\nhigh AG acidosis. These substances are converted to metabolic anions that increase the AG;\nmethanol is converted to formate acid, ethylene glycol is converted to glycolate and oxalic acids, and\nsalicylate is converted to ketones and lactic acid.\nIncreased AG acidosis can be caused by overproduction of organic acids due to inborn errors of\nmetabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, or fatty acids. As described above, lactic acidosis can\nalso result from some inborn errors of metabolism.\nCauses of Normal AG Metabolic Acidosis\n\nMetabolic acidosis with a normal AG is caused by a loss of HCO − or impaired renal excretion of H+ in\n3\nthe absence of renal failure. In patients with HCO − loss, the kidneys increase Cl− retention in a direct\n3\nmilliequivalent for milliequivalent exchange to compensate for HCO − loss to maintain\n3\nelectroneutrality. Consequently, hyperchloremia is a hallmark finding of normal AG metabolic\nacidosis, which is also referred to as hyperchloremic normal AG metabolic acidosis.\nPediatric causes of normal hyperchloremic AG metabolic acidosis include gastrointestinal losses, with\ndiarrhea being the most common cause. Other less common pediatric causes of gastrointestinal\nHCO − loss include enteric fistulae, enterostomies, and chronic laxative loss.\n3\nRTA in also a common cause of a normal anion gap acidosis. There are 3 major types of RTA. RTA\ntype I, also call distal RTA, is caused by a defect in net acid excretion. RTA type II, also called\nproximal RTA, is caused by a lower renal threshold for bicarbonate reabsorption. RTA type IV, also\ncalled hyperkalemic RTA, is caused by selective aldosterone deficiency or resistance (Figure 2).\nMixed Causes of Metabolic Acidosis\nMixed disorders occur when there are simultaneous causes of normal and high AG metabolic\nacidosis in the same patient. These disorders are often difficult to diagnose and differentiate from\nhigh AG metabolic acidosis because both have an elevated AG. The most common pediatric example\nof a mixed disorder is severe diarrhea (normal AG with a low HCO −) accompanied by lactic acidosis\n3\n(high AG) due to hypoperfusion, resulting from hypovolemia caused by severe gastrointestinal fluid\nloss.\n\nPREP Pearls\n Metabolic acidosis has many causes, and once the anion gap is determined, the cause can be further\ninvestigated.\n Non–anion gap metabolic acidosis is usually caused by extrarenal losses of bicarbonate or renal tubular\nacidosis.\n Anion gap acidosis is usually caused by lactic acidosis due to multiple causes, including uremia; diabetic\nketoacidosis; ingestion of ethylene glycol, methanol, or salicylate; or inborn errors of metabolism.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the causes of a metabolic acidosis\nSuggested Readings\n Emmett M, Narins RG.

In either case, the technology has progressed so that analysis of\nthe data is the challenge. The optimal filtering strategy to identify pathologic variants has not yet been\nidentified. In addition, the background prevalence of variants in the population needs to be accounted\nfor in the filter. For example, a typical filter actually detected higher rate of variants in healthy subjects\nin a reference population when compared with a cohort of patients with nephrotic syndrome.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned genes, there are risk alleles in the APOL1 gene. These risk alleles\n(G1 and G2) in the last exon of the APOL1 gene are found in patients of West African descent. They\nare thought to confer resistance to Trypanosoma brucei infection. If 2 risk alleles are inherited, they\nconfer a 10- to 20-fold increased risk of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The mechanism of this is\nunclear. The presence of these risk alleles in the African American community is thought to confer\nmuch of the excess risk of end-stage kidney disease in this community. Up to 70% of African\nAmerican children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis have a high-risk APOL1 genotype in some\nstudies.\nPREP Pearls\n Monogenic causes of nephrotic syndrome are relatively rare in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in school-\nage children without consanguineous parents or a family history.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the genetic basis of the hereditary forms of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\nSuggested Readings\n Chen YM, Liapis H.

    "explanation": "A. cap mesenchyme\nThe infant described in the vignette has bilateral renal hypoplasia associated with deafness and\nchromosomal microdeletion that encompasses the SIX1 gene, a homeobox transcription factor that is\nrequired for the DNA-binding activity of the EYA1 protein. EYA1 loss-of-function causes branchio-oto-\nrenal syndrome.\nThe metanephric kidney develops from reciprocal and iterative interactions between 2 cell lineages in\nthe posterior intermediate mesoderm called the ureteric bud (UB) and metanephric mesenchyme\n(MM). Nephrogenesis begins when each UB branch tip induces the surrounding MM to condense and\nform a crescent-shaped compartment called the cap mesenchyme (CM). The CM, made up of 4 to 5\nlayers of mesenchymal cells, the surrounding stroma (primitive interstitial cells), and the UB tip\ncompartments make up the so-called nephrogenic niche (Figure 1 ).\n\nFigure 1: Compartments of the nephrogenic niche\n\nThe CM itself is divided into subcompartments, each identified by specific and shared molecular\nmarkers. The subcompartment lying directly on top of the UB tip and beneath the stroma houses the\nself-renewing nephron progenitor cells (NPCs), a group of undifferentiated stem-like cells\nexpressing Cited1, Eya1, and Six2 in mice and SIX1 and EYA1 in humans. Lineage tracing in mice\nhas revealed that Cited1+/Six2+NPCs give rise to all segments of the epithelial nephron from the\nglomerulus to the connecting tubule. Cited1+/Six2+NPCs are resistant to inducing factors, which allows\nthem to undergo about 4 cell divisions throughout their lifetime under the influence of growth factors,\nsuch as fibroblast growth factors 9 and 20. Transition from the Cited1+/Six2+to Cited1−/Six2+state\nrenders the NPCs sensitive to inductive signals and is presumably mediated by activation of bone\nmorphogenetic protein 7–SMAD signaling. For currently unknown but intensively investigated\nreasons, NPCs are short-lived, and all NPCs differentiate en mass at the end of gestation (34 weeks\nin humans and postnatal day 2-4 in mice), leading to their depletion and cessation of nephrogenesis.\nThe patient in the vignette has a loss-of function mutation in SIX1, which is expressed specifically in\nthe CM. Consequently, loss of SIX1/EYA1 function results in depletion of NPCs, premature cessation\nof nephrogenesis, and reduced nephron endowment (ie, renal hypoplasia)\nThe stromal compartment, lying underneath the renal capsule rostral to the CM and surrounding the\nnascent nephrons, is called the cortical stroma and expresses the transcription factor Foxd1. Fate\nmapping in mice has revealed that Foxd1-lineage cells give rise to interstitial fibroblasts, pericytes,\narteriolar vascular smooth muscle cells, juxtaglomerular renin-expressing cells, and mesangial cells.\nThe cortical stroma in contact with the CM appears to restrain NPC renewal and promote their\ndifferentiation into nascent nephrons via direct contact and by releasing soluble factors. The\nmedullary stroma expresses low levels of Foxd1 but high levels of another transcription factor called\nMeis1. The fate of the medullary stroma is not well understood but likely gives rise to pericytes\nsurrounding the peritubular capillaries in response to inductive signals from the adjacent ureteric bud\nepithelium.\nFinally, the UB tip compartment is composed of progenitor cells that express the c-Ret proto-\noncogene. Lineage tracing revealed that UB tip cells are the progenitors of all cell types of the\ncollecting duct.\nPREP Pearls\n The developing kidney is a complex organ composed of multiple interconnecting compartments.\n The nephrogenic niche is composed of 3 major compartments: the cap mesenchyme, cortical stroma, and\nureteric bud tip.\n Lineage analysis has revealed that the cap mesenchyme gives rise to the epithelial nephron, the ureteric bud\ntip to the collecting ducts, and the stroma to the interstitium, pericytes, vascular smooth muscle, renin cells,\nand mesangium.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the compartmental development of the kidney\nSuggested Readings\n Carroll TJ, Das A.

    "explanation": "D. risk factors for deterioration in renal function are not well known, and defining prognosis is difficult\nThe child described in the vignette and her father have nail-patella syndrome (NPS), which is\nan autosomal dominant condition. Therefore, the daughter is not a mere carrier of the condition but\nclearly has the disorder. In addition, the nephropathy is not responsive to immunosuppressive\nmedications. The risk factors for progression of nephropathy are unknown. Only a few patients with\nnephropathy progress to end-stage kidney disease. As frustrating as it may be for the family and the\nphysician, our current understanding of NPS nephropathy does not allow for us to make valid\npredictions of who may or may not progress with their kidney disease. Therefore, risk factors for\ndeterioration in renal function are not well known, and defining prognosis is difficult. Recent findings\nthat certain mutations of LMX1B may be at higher risk of more severe nephropathy may allow for\nbetter prognostication based on genetic risk, but without knowing the actual pathogenetic mechanism\nof the kidney disease, it is extremely difficult to study the factors that may influence disease\nseverity.\nThe distinctive physical features described in this vignette include abnormalities of the nails, skeleton,\nand joints with a hereditary pattern that fits the description of NPS. This disorder has also been called\nFong disease, Turner-Keiser syndrome, and Osterreicher-Turner syndrome but is probably best\nreferred to as hereditary osteo-onychodysplasia because it describes the classic physical findings\nand intimates to the genetic heritability of this disorder. The pattern of autosomal dominant heritability\nof NPS was first described in the Lancet in the Victorian era, back in 1897, and it was one of the first\ndisorders in which a linkage relationship was established with the ABO blood group in the 1950s. This\naided identification of the related gene, LMX1B, on the long arm of chromosome 9 (q34) with this\ndisorder. However, there remain large gaps in our understanding of determinants of this disease in\nhumans.\nThe LMX1B geneencodes a transcription factor that had been previously associated with dorsoventral\nlimb patterning in other species, such as the chicken and mouse, so its human ortholog reflects\ndysplasia of structures derived from the dorsal mesenchyme. The classic tetrad of findings associated\nwith NPS is abnormalities of the nails, patella, and elbows along with iliac horns. Nail changes have\nbeen reported in 98% of patients with NPS but may vary greatly in degree of subtlety of changes.\nTriangular lunules of the nails, as described in this vignette, were seen in 88% of patients with NPS in\nthe largest phenotype study to date. More overt findings, such as nail hypoplasia or dysplasia, may\nalso occur, but involvement of the distal interphalangeal joint with skin changes or reduced range of\nmotion may be more prevalent. Recurrent subluxation of the patella or the radial head at the elbow\nmay also be seen because of hypoplasia of these bones. Iliac horns, which project posteriorly and\nlaterally from the central part of the iliac bones, are pathognomonic of NPS, although reported as\npresent in 68% of individuals in the large phenotype study. The Table contains a list of major\nextrarenal features seen in NPS.\nTable.

The most common finding of nephropathy in NPS is\nproteinuria, with some patients, but not all, also having hematuria. On kidney biopsy, patients with\nNPS nephropathy are likely to have normal-appearing glomeruli on light microscopy, although some\ndegree of glomerular sclerosis may also be seen. However, electron microscopy should reveal\nirregular glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening with bundles of type III collagen fibers\ndeposited in the lamina densa, giving a moth-eaten (lucent) appearance to the GBM. There may also\nbe subsequent podocyte foot process effacement. Immunofluorescence results are typically negative,\nor there may be nonspecific staining for IgM or C3.\nWith the irregularities to the GBM, NPS was once thought related to Alport syndrome; however, the\nglomeruli in patients with NPS stain normally for α - and α - chains of type IV collagen. NPS should\n3 4\nalso be distinguished from collagen type III glomerulopathy, another hereditary disorder (although\nautosomal recessive) without extrarenal features, that notably has type III collagen deposition in the\nsubendothelial space in addition to the GBM, whereas NPS does not.\nAlthough LMX1B gene mutations have been identified with NPS for more than 20 years, the exact\nmechanism for how these mutations cause nephropathy in humans has still not been\nelucidated. LMX1B has an important role in kidney development and maintenance of podocytes,\nbeing expressed in podocytes prenatally as early as the S-shaped body stage into postnatal\nlife. LMX1B-null mice have reduced glomerular expression of α - and α - chains of type IV collagen,\n3 4\nsomewhat similar to what may be expected in Alport syndrome. However, this has not been seen in\nhumans with NPS, making it difficult to know whether it is regulation of type IV collagen or other\n\nabnormal gene transcription that causes the renal disease. Inducible deletion of LMX1B in fully\ndifferentiated murine podocytes causes dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and proteinuria, so it\nhas been speculated that changes to the proteins composing the slit diaphragm are also likely\naffected. Recently, a specified mutation of LMX1B (R246) was associated with altered expression of\nCD2AP and podocin (NPHS2) within the podocytes of some individuals with NPS, but this had not\nbeen seen previously in patients with NPS, perhaps because these individuals had different\nmutations than at R246. The differences found between the animal models of disease and those\nindividuals with NPS have been one of the obstacles to fully understanding this disorder. Adding to\nthe consternation surrounding this disease are recent reports of patients with LMX1B mutations and\nkidney disease but no extrarenal manifestations.\nThe lack of uniformity of kidney disease in NPS has equally been confounding to understand this\ndisorder. The clinical findings of nephropathy are not seen in all patients with NPS. Estimates of the\nincidence of proteinuria generally range from 20% to 60%. The largest phenotype study to date\nreported an overall incidence of proteinuria as 37.5%, but this decreased to only 25% when they\nexcluded women with NPS who were only proteinuric while pregnant. The progression of proteinuria\nand decline in renal function can also be inconstant. There is variability in the degree of nephropathy\nreported within kindreds, with children having nephrotic-range proteinuria, whereas the affected\nparent has very mild, if any, detectable proteinuria. Patients with NPS nephropathy have an\naccelerated loss of filtration function as they age when compared with individuals with NPS but\nwithout nephropathy. However, the progression to end-stage kidney disease has been reported to be\nonly 5% to 10% of those with NPS nephropathy, constituting only a few affected patients.\nThere have been no general identifiable clinical factors to predict which patients with NPS will\ndevelop proteinuria or end-stage kidney disease to date. Studies have found that the NPS allele of\nthe affected parent, but not the specific mutation, can affect the severity of nail dysplasia in offspring,\nbut there have been no large-scale associations made in regard to the presence of nephropathy or\ndegree of proteinuria. A few recent studies of patients with a mutation of LMX1B at R246 have\nindicated that these individuals seem to develop chronic kidney disease and fare more poorly than\nother NPS mutations. It has been speculated that mutations within the homeodomain of LMX1B, like\nR246, also seem to have higher rates of nephropathy.\nThe treatment of NPS nephropathy is based off the premise that the progression of chronic kidney\ndisease is slowed by minimizing the degree of proteinuria, as seen in other renal disorders. However,\nno studies in NPS have found that antiproteinuric therapy, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme\ninhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, have proven benefit in this disorder. Hypertension is\nuncommon in NPS nephropathy. Because this is a congenital disorder of the GBM, like Alport\nsyndrome, modulation of the immune system is unlikely to have any effect on the proteinuria.\nPREP Pearls\n The nephropathy of nail-patella syndrome (NPS) typically presents with asymptomatic proteinuria. Therefore,\nthis disorder should be considered in patients with asymptomatic proteinuria who have additional skeletal or\nnail abnormalities. However, the skeletal and nail abnormalities of NPS are not always overt and may require\nsome investigation.\n The recommended treatment of the nephropathy of NPS is with antiproteinuric agents that affect the renin-\nangiotensin system, but this is based on therapeutic efficacy in other proteinuric disorders and has not yet\nbeen studied for efficacy in this particular disorder.\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the natural history and epidemiology of nail-patella syndrome\nSuggested Readings\n Harita Y, Kitanaka S, Isojima T, Ashida A, Hattori M.

    "explanation": "C. hydralazine\nGestational exposure of the maternal-fetal unit to certain environmental factors may be detrimental to\nrenal organogenesis. Some nutritional factors, such as maternal vitamin A level, have been\npostulated to mediate the variations in nephron number found in the population. The child described\nin the vignette was discovered to have small kidneys, a surrogate for low nephron endowment, during\nevaluation of polyuria, a common clinical manifestation of renal hypoplasia.\nExperimental studies in animals have illustrated the effects of maternal factors on the fetus, newborn,\nand adult. These effects include nutritional deficiency, pharmacologic agents, and placental\ninsufficiency. The case in the vignette illustrates the coexistence of many environmental factors, such\nas placental insufficiency (maternal diabetes and hypertension), poor nutrition, and exposure to\ndrugs. Because nephrogenesis ends by 34 to 36 weeks of gestation, nephron regeneration\npostnatally is not possible. Accordingly, obtaining a detailed maternal history is crucial when\nevaluating the child and adult with renal and cardiovascular disease.\nMaternal perturbations tend to have critical windows during which the effect of the environmental\nstressor is believed to be most damaging to fetal organogenesis. Epidemiologic studies of the Dutch\nwinter famine suggest that maternal undernutrition during the first trimester of pregnancy is\nassociated with increased incidence of adult obesity and cardiovascular disease. On the other hand,\nmaternal undernutrition during the second trimester is more associated with renal dysfunction in the\noffspring, whereas maternal undernutrition late in gestation results in infants with low birth weight.\nSeveral animal studies have found that even a mild degree of maternal vitamin A deficiency, causing\n50% reduction in circulating vitamin A in the fetus, is sufficient to induce a 25% reduction in nephron\nnumbers. Interestingly, giving vitamin A to protein-deprived pregnant rats at midgestation prevented\nthe nephron deficit observed in the growth retarded pups. Vitamin A acts via stimulating c-Ret gene\nexpression in the ureteric bud tips, thus enhancing ureteric bud–branching morphogenesis. Vitamin A\nalso acts by maintaining the integrity of the renal vascular network in the developing kidney.\nImpaired renal organogenesis occurs with increased frequency in the offspring of diabetic mothers in\nhumans and animals and in metanephric kidneys cultured in the presence of elevated d-glucose\nconcentrations in the medium. Hyperglycemia appears to negatively affect the survival of the\nmetanephric mesenchyme and to impair ureteric bud branching.\nA defect in ureteric bud branching is the principal cause of aminoglycoside-induced oligonephronia.\nβ-Lactam antibiotics, which are commonly prescribed during pregnancy, have also been implicated in\ncausing nephron deficits. The aminopenicillins, ampicillin and amoxicillin, cause nephron deficit in\nvitro and in vivo at a dosage normally used in clinical practice. Unlike aminoglycoside, the penicillins\naffect renal development by enhancing apoptosis in the metanephric mesenchyme, suggesting that\nthe 2 nephric lineages (metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric bud) are differentially susceptible to\nenvironmental insults. Interestingly, ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, has a minor effect\non nephrogenesis compared with other β-lactams. Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, also\naffect nephrogenesis in vitro. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin and prostaglandin systems are\ncontraindicated during pregnancy. Angiotensin II is required for fetal renal vasculogenesis, whereas\nprostaglandins are required for the patency of ductus arteriosus and maintenance of fetal renal blood\nflow. Unlike the drugs listed above, hydralazine, a direct vasodilator, used extensively to treat\ngestational hypertension, has no reported effect on fetal organogenesis.\nPREP Pearls\n Multiple environmental factors often coexist during pregnancy that may affect renal organogenesis.\n\n Environmental events tend to have critical windows of opportunity to exert the negative effects on\nnephrogenesis.\n Nutritional factors, uteroplacental insufficiency, drugs, and maternal hyperglycemia are the most commonly\nencountered adverse environmental events leading to congenital nephron deficit.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the impact of the fetal environment on renal development\nSuggested Readings\n Dorey ES, Pantaleon M, Weir KA, Moritz KM.

    "explanation": "B. is 30%\nThe girl in this vignette has clinical and genetic features consistent with atypical hemolytic uremic\nsyndrome (aHUS; microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, in a very young child,\nwithout other triggers, presence of certain genetic mutations). After other diseases, such as\npneumococcal-hemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, are ruled out,\nthe remaining forms of aHUS are characterized by abnormalities in the complement system, typically\nthe inhibitory regulators of complement. Lack of inhibition allows the complement system to remain\nactive, and it can become overactive in response to unknown triggers. Abnormalities in the\ncomplement system can be caused by genetic mutations in complement factor 3 or complement\ninhibitors or by development of antibodies to the regulators from mutations in related proteins. The\naffected complement regulators include complement factor H (CFH), complement factor H–related 5,\ncomplement factor I (CFI), complement factor B, membrane cofactor protein (MCP or CD46), and\nthrombomodulin. In addition, diacylglycerol kinase epsilon is a non–complement-inhibiting factor that\nassociates with aHUS when mutated.\nPatients with aHUS may have homozygous mutations in 1 of the complement or complement\nregulator genes (30%-60% of patients), no identifiable mutations (20%-40% of patients), or\nheterozygous compound mutations in 2 complement regulator genes (3%-6% of patients).\nEach mutation can have variable penetrance. Combined mutations are more common in patients\nwith CFI or CD46 mutations (25% of patients), but less common in patients with gene mutations in\nCFH, complement factor 3, or complement factor B (8%-10%). The presence of combined mutations\nin CFH and CD46 increases the penetrance from 36% to 73% and increases the chance of end-stage\nkidney disease by 3 years of onset from 19% to 50%. In contrast, combined mutations\nin CFH or CFI with non-CD46 mutations do not modify the prognosis.\nPosttransplant recurrence of aHUS was very common in the pre-C5 blockade era; recurrence\noccurred in up to 60% of patients, and the subsequent graft survival was very poor (30% survival at 5\nyears if recurrence vs 68% if no recurrence). As seen in cases of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,\nif a prior failed allograft exhibited recurrence, then the risk of aHUS recurrence in a later allograft is\nvery high, approximately 80%. The risk varies with the gene affected. Risk of recurrence is highest\nwith CFH or complement factor B gene mutations (80%), lower with CFI mutations (50%), and lowest\nwith isolated CD46 mutations (< 10%), where the allograft expresses the nonmutated MCP protein,\nwhich is cell bound and not circulating. However, when a CD46 mutation is associated with a\nconcomitant mutation in CFH or CFI (as is the case in this vignette), then the risk increases to\napproximately 30%. Although acute rejection episodes may activate complement, they have not been\nshown to affect the likelihood of aHUS recurrence.\nRecurrence may be preventable with use of prophylactic C5 blockade using eculizumab in cases\nwhere the recurrence risk is high. In lower risk cases, prophylaxis may be deferred; treatment should\nbe initiated if recurrence occurs, and the recovery is usually good if treatment is started early.\nOther forms of thrombotic microangiopathy have low to negligible rates of recurrence.

    "explanation": "C. serial renal ultrasonography\nThe newborn in this vignette has a left multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK). Serial renal\nultrasonography is essential for the management of MCDK disease to assess for involution of the\ncystic kidney and confirm appropriate structure and compensatory growth of the contralateral kidney.\nSimple unilateral MCDK with a normal contralateral kidney has an excellent prognosis for overall\nkidney function. However, there is a significant incidence of contralateral renal abnormalities including\nvesicoureteral reflux, urinary tract obstruction, and milder forms of renal hypodysplasia. If\nabnormalities are present, the child may be at risk for recurrent febrile urinary tract infection,\nhypertension, or progressive chronic kidney disease. Supportive monitoring for MCDK therefore\nincludes serial renal ultrasonography, urinalysis, and blood pressure measurement to screen for signs\nof renal functional impairment or complications.\nA MCDK is strictly defined as a nonreniform collection of cysts. There is no identifiable renal tissue,\nand the kidney has no function. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans can be considered in the\nevaluation of MCDK but are not usually essential. A functional renal scan or diuretic functional renal\nscan is most commonly performed when there is uncertainty whether the abnormal kidney represents\na MCDK, a dysplastic kidney with cysts (and therefore, some function), or a congenital ureteropelvic\njunction obstruction. Functional scans are usually not needed, especially if the MCDK has already\nbegun involution prenatally or in the first year after birth, as occurs in the majority of cases.\nPreviously, there was concern that the MCDK could result in increased incidence of urinary tract\ninfection, hypertension, or malignant transformation to nephroblastoma or renal cell carcinoma.\nTherefore, past management has included nephrectomy. More recent studies demonstrate that\nnephrectomy is unnecessary. Provided there is a normal contralateral kidney and urinary tract, there\ndoes not appear to be an increased risk for urinary tract infection or hypertension. Importantly, larger\nregistries have not illustrated an increased association with renal malignancy or malignant\ntransformation of the cysts. Nephrectomy is now rarely indicated and only for unique circumstances.\nThere is an increased risk of vesicoureteral reflux in patients with MCDK, as high as 30% to 40% in\nsome case series. Reflux may occur on either the ipsilateral or contralateral side. Larger registries\nhave demonstrated that most of these cases are lower grade reflux (grade 1 or 2) and that the\nidentification of the reflux has not altered clinical monitoring or management. Because of the\nsignificant incidence of reflux, many providers obtain voiding cystourethrography. However, if the\ncontralateral kidney and the urinary tract appear otherwise normal, many providers only use voiding\ncystourethrography if the patient develops a febrile urinary tract infection. Therefore, serial renal\nultrasonography should be the mainstay of management, whereas voiding cystourethrography may\nbe considered but is not absolutely needed for the neonate in this vignette.\nPREP Pearls\n Multicystic dysplastic kidney disease that is simple and unilateral without contralateral renal or urinary tract\nabnormalities has an excellent prognosis.\n The management of multicystic dysplastic kidney disease should include serial ultrasonography to assess for\ncompensatory growth and normal structure of the contralateral kidney and normal structure of the urinary tract.\n Functional renal scans and voiding cystourethrography may be considered in the evaluation of patients with\nmulticystic dysplastic kidney disease, but they are not always necessary.\n Nephrectomy is now rarely indicated and only for unique circumstances.\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the management of multicystic renal dysplasia\nSuggested Readings\n Hains DS, Bates CM, Ingraham S, Schwaderer AL.

    "explanation": "A. fractional excretion of uric acid is likely to be low\nMedullary cystic disease, also known as autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease\n(ADTKD), is a rare progressive renal disease in children. Patients will usually have a strong family\nhistory of chronic kidney disease that follows an autosomal dominant pattern, because de novo\nmutations are rare. Mutations in genes encoding uromodulin (UMOD), renin (REN), hepatocyte\nnuclear factor-1β (HNF1B), and mucin-1 (MUC1) have been implicated in ADTKD. The progressive\ndecline in kidney function usually occurs after the teenage years and is associated with\ntubulointerstitial fibrosis. Cysts are only occasionally detected. Furthermore, the medulla may not be\nthe location of these cysts. Thus, the term “medullary cystic kidney disease” is misleading, and the\npreferred nomenclature is ADTKD.\nThe clinical presentation of ADTKD is usually nonspecific. Classic clinical findings are presented\nin Table 1.\nTable 1.

Autosomal dominant\ntubulointerstitial kidney disease: diagnosis, classification, and management—a KDIGO consensus report.\nKidney Int. 2015;88(4):676-683.\nDuring teenage years, patients may have elevated creatinine levels. Their urine sediment is usually\nbland with evidence of concentrating defect, microscopic hematuria is rare, and proteinuria may be\nminimal or absent. A kidney biopsy, which is not necessary for diagnosis, will demonstrate interstitial\nfibrosis, normal glomeruli with negative immunofluorescence results, and occasional tubular dilation\nconsistent with microcysts.\nLaboratory abnormalities can be specific to the subtypes of ADTKD. Hyperuricemia often occurs in\nADTKD associated with UMOD and REN mutations. The UMOD mutation–associated ADTKD results\nin underexcretion (not overproduction) of urate. The differential diagnosis for teenaged patients who\nhave gout and abnormal kidney function should include ADTKD.\nA low renin state with low angiotensin levels occurs in ADTKD associated\nwith REN mutations. These patients will have normal blood pressure, mild hyperkalemia, and anemia\nthat is disproportionate to their renal dysfunction; this anemia is thought to be secondary to\ndecreased erythropoietin levels.\nAn overview of the different clinical presentations of ADTKD with each known mutation is outlined\nin Table 2.\n\nTable 2.

Autosomal dominant\ntubulointerstitial kidney disease: diagnosis, classification, and management—a KDIGO consensus report.\nKidney Int. 2015;88(4):676-683.\nRadiography is not usually helpful in the diagnosis of ADTKD in children. Cysts are not usually\npresent until late in the disease course and are not thought to impinge on normal parenchyma or lead\nto progressive renal function decline.\nTreatment of ADTKD is largely supportive. No specific therapy exists for any of the subtypes, so\nmanaging risk factors that can accelerate renal decline, such as hypertension and diabetes, is critical.\nIf patients have hyperuricemia and hypertension, losartan should considered because it also\nincreases urinary urate excretion.\nThe patient in this vignette exhibits a classic presentation of UMOD mutation–associated ADTKD.\nThe mutation in UMOD leads to underexcretion of uric acid, which can be assessed by calculating the\nfractional excretion of uric acid as follows:\n(urine uric acid/serum uric acid) ÷ (urine creatinine/serum creatinine).\nIf this value is below 6%, underexcretion is present. Because the elevated serum uric acid levels are\nsecondary to underexcretion and not overproduction, uric acid crystals are not seen in renal tubules\nor urine, and uric acid stones do not occur. Also, a metabolic evaluation is not needed with an\nautosomal dominant pattern of kidney disease in the family history, renal insufficiency, and low\nfractional excretion of uric acid. Finally, medullary cysts are not always present (< 50% of patients will\nhave detectable cysts), and therefore their absence does not rule out ADTKD.\nPREP Pearls\n Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease associated with UMOD mutations results in\nunderexcretion of uric acid and hyperuricemia/gout.\n Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease associated with REN mutations results in a low renin\nstate and a subsequent angiotensin deficiency with low blood pressure, hyperkalemia, and anemia out of\nproportion to the degree of renal insufficiency.\n Medullary cysts are not usually present in autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease, formally known\nas medullary cystic kidney disease.\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the laboratory and uroradiologic evaluation of medullary cystic disease including prenatal diagnosis\nSuggested Readings\n Bleyer AJ, Zivná M, Hulková H, et al.

Oral rehydration solutions that are\nisotonic with equimolar concentrations of glucose and sodium are as effective as intravenous\nhydration in treating hypovolemia in patients with diarrhea. The World Health Organization\nrecommended properties for oral rehydration solutions and formulations that are available can be\nfound at http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/9241593180/en/. Amino acid,\nchloride, and hydrogen ion, although operational in the gastrointestinal tract, are not used to facilitate\nsodium and water reabsorption in the setting of diarrhea-associated volume depletion.\nORT was first used in 1945 but came into its own in the 1960s with the development of effective ORT\nformulations. Since that time ORT has saved countless lives of children with diarrhea-associated\nhypovolemia, especially in developing countries. In addition, ORT is as effective as intravenous\nrehydration therapy in treating hypovolemia from diarrheal illness attributable to gastroenteritis. ORT\nwas also associated with a shorter length of hospitalization, lower costs, and fewer serious\ncomplications.\nORT makes use of the physiologic basis for water absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. The 3\nprincipal mechanisms that permit passive water absorption in the gastrointestinal tract are the\npresence of sodium-hydrogen exchangers, establishment of an electrochemical gradient, and the\nsodium-coupled transport with carrier organic solutes (eg, glucose and amino acids). Disruption of\nany of these processes can result in diarrhea. However, in children with diarrhea attributable to\ngastroenteritis, the sodium-coupled cotransport with glucose and other carrier organic solutes\nremains intact.\nFluids with a molar ratio of glucose in excess of sodium, such as fruit juices, soda, or sports\nbeverages, increase diarrheal losses because the higher unabsorbed glucose load will increase the\nosmolality in the lumen, resulting in decreased water absorption. Fluids high in sodium may increase\ndiarrheal losses and may result in hypernatremia.\nAlthough glucose is used as the carrier organic solute for sodium-coupled transport, other alternatives\nhave been studied, including zinc, probiotics, glucose polymers, ʟ-isoleucine, glycine, alanine, and\nglutamine. However, no data indicate that they are more effective than glucose. Common household\nbeverages and fluids are not recommended because they have a much higher carbohydrate and\nosmolality content than commercial and standard oral rehydration solutions.

    "explanation": "B. decrease the calcium bath to 2.5 mEq/L\nIn this vignette, the patient has developed hypercalcemia with a desired serum phosphorus level and\nan overly suppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level while receiving several therapies that can\naffect these values. Although choices A through C may all lower serum calcium levels (choice D\nwould raise levels if given an equivalent dose), only choice B (decrease the calcium bath to 2.5\nmEq/L) would not adversely affect other aspects of the patient’s bone and mineral disease. The\naddition of a calcimimetic (choice A) would be expected to lower the serum calcium level, but would\nalso further decrease an already suppressed intact PTH level and worsen any adynamic bone\ndisease. Decreasing the treatment time (choice C) would decrease the overall diffusion of calcium to\nthe patient, but would also decrease the diffusive clearance of phosphorus. Decreasing the calcium\nbath (choice B) would lower the patient’s total exposure to (and absorption of) calcium without\nimpacting the PTH or phosphorus level.\nSerum calcium levels are tightly regulated in most individuals by the deft integration of the kidneys,\nbone, intestine, and parathyroid glands, such that normal serum phosphorus and PTH levels are also\nmaintained. However, in patients with decreased renal function, there can be insufficient active\nvitamin D levels, low dietary calcium intake, or inadequate renal excretion of phosphate, leading to a\ndisruption of this delicate balance. Hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperparathyroidism may\nall develop and become increasingly more prevalent as the glomerular filtration rate lowers. The goals\nof bone and mineral disease management in end-stage kidney disease are to maintain both serum\ncalcium and phosphorus levels in the normal range, while having permissibly elevated PTH levels to\nallow for appropriate bone turnover and growth. Balancing these 3 goals can become challenging\nbecause of the differing effects of agents that influence bone and mineral homeostasis.\nEnteral calcium intake (both dietary and calcium-containing binders), dialysate calcium, and the use\nof activated vitamin D analogs are the primary determinants of calcium balance in patients receiving\ndialysis. Hypercalcemia had previously been an uncommon complication in dialysis. Most patients on\ndialysis would have a negative calcium balance when dialysate calcium levels were set to the normal\nphysiologic level, around 2.5 mEq/L, as their dietary intake was not sufficient. Therefore, higher\ndialysate calcium concentrations became an early standard, as they would allow for a positive\ncalcium balance to the patient and correction of hyperparathyroidism. With the advent of calcium-\ncontaining phosphate binders in the 1980s, hypercalcemia became a more prevalent issue. Elevated\nserum calcium levels, combined with elevated phosphate levels, increase the risk of precipitation of\ncalcium-phosphate salts within different tissues, most importantly within the medial layer of\nvasculature, and the worsening of cardiovascular disease in the already at-risk dialysis population. In\nthe adult hemodialysis population, several studies, including the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice\nPatterns Study (DOPPS), have shown hypercalcemia to be associated with an increased risk of\ndeath. This association led to hypercalcemia (or the percentage of dialysis patients having an\nelevated rolling average of serum calcium) being the first measure of bone and mineral disease\nadded to the list of dialysis measures in the Quality Improvement Program in 2014.\nGuidelines on management of bone and mineral disease in patients with chronic kidney disease have\nbeen developed by both the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and Kidney\nDisease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) working groups. Although these 2 guidelines are\nsimilar, they have some slight differences in recommendations that reveal our limited knowledge in\nsome aspects of this disorder. It is recommended by KDOQI that “serum levels of total corrected\ncalcium should be maintained in the normal range…and preferably toward the lower end” (Am J\nKidney Dis. 2005;46 [4, suppl 1]:S1-121) in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease, whereas the\nKDIGO recommendations only state maintaining serum calcium levels within the normal range for\npatients with stages 3, 4, and 5 chronic kidney disease. Both guidelines recommend courses of action\nin the event of hypercalcemia, with restrictions being placed on the dose of calcium-based phosphate\n\nbinders or the dose of vitamin D analog, if used. Additionally, KDOQI recommends using a lower (<\n2.5 mEq/L) dialysate calcium level for 3 to 4 weeks if there is persistent hypercalcemia despite\nmaking the aforementioned first-line changes. However, activated vitamin D analogs and calcium-\nbased phosphate binders also have direct effects on PTH and phosphorus levels, whereas dialysate\ncalcium concentration does not tend to directly affect these other values (although PTH levels will be\nindirectly affected), so the potential for other unintended consequences must be accounted for when\nmaking these adjustments.\nThis difference in the use of lower dialysate calcium concentrations likely stems from differences in\nthe general recommendations of the 2 groups in the appropriate calcium concentrations, both for\nhemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, to use at baseline. The dialysate calcium concentrations\nrecommended by the KDOQI guidelines are 2.5 mEq/L for patients who receive calcium-based\nphosphate binders and 2.5 to 3 mEq/L for patients who do not receive this type of binder. The KDIGO\nguidelines recommend dialysate calcium concentrations between 2.5 and 3 mEq/L, irrespective of the\ntype of binder being used. Higher dialysate calcium concentrations have been associated with less\nintradialytic hypotension and less arrhythmias in adult hemodialysis patients, therefore these\ndialysates may be indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients. Similarly, higher dialysate calcium\nconcentrations have also been associated with lower PTH levels in pediatric peritoneal dialysis\npatients with significant hyperparathyroidism. However, the use of these higher calcium\nconcentrations is also associated with a greater long-term risk of hypercalcemia.\nThe dialysis prescription may also affect calcium balance with differences in both treatment time and\nultrafiltration volumes. Net removal of calcium by convection can exceed the amount gained by\ndiffusion, so alterations in ultrafiltration volumes in hemodialysis could theoretically lower serum\ncalcium levels, but the amount of ultrafiltration needed to achieve this decrease may cause other\nsignificant side effects. Similarly, a reduction in dialysis time, both in peritoneal dialysis and\nhemodialysis, would provide less diffusion of calcium to the patient and a less positive calcium\nbalance. However, it would also provide less diffusive clearance of phosphorus, possibly to a greater\ndegree. Therefore, a reduction in time on dialysis (choice C) would theoretically treat the\nhypercalcemia described in the patient in this vignette, but would also reduce the clearance of\nphosphate and possibly lead to hyperphosphatemia.\nThe selection of phosphate binders should be based on the serum phosphorus and calcium levels, as\nwell as the age and oral intake capabilities of the patient. In adolescent patients on dialysis on a\nphosphorus-restricted diet, their dietary intake of calcium is often very low and calcium\nsupplementation is typically needed. The total daily intake of dietary calcium, which includes calcium-\nbased binders, should not exceed twice the daily recommended amount (Dietary Reference Intake)\nfor age or 2,500 mg total for adolescents and adults. Therefore, it is beneficial to know the calcium\ncontent and enteral absorption of binder options to address the patient’s phosphate levels while not\nproviding excessive amounts of enteral calcium. In children with chronic kidney disease, calcium\nacetate provides a greater degree of phosphate binding (with lower posttreatment phosphate levels)\nthan calcium carbonate. Similarly, acetate supplies less elemental calcium than carbonate, although\nthere have not been any significant differences in hypercalcemic episodes in children when these 2\nforms of calcium are compared. The calcium-free binder, sevelamer, has been used safely in children\non dialysis for years and has been associated with less hypercalcemia when compared to calcium-\nbased binders in this pediatric population. This binder would be an optimal choice to replace the\ncalcium acetate, if offered, in the scenario described in the vignette. Replacing calcium acetate with\ncalcium carbonate (choice D) would not be optimal as it may place the patient at higher risk of\nhypercalcemia if an equivalent dose was used, while providing less phosphate binding.\nCalcimimetic agents increase the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid\ngland, suppressing both serum calcium and PTH levels. Therefore, calcimimetics affect the serum\n\ncalcium level by affecting the amount of PTH released by the gland and are indicated for use in\nprimary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Updated KDIGO guidelines suggest calcimimetic use to lower\nPTH levels, but also recommend its discontinuation in dialysis patients when the PTH level is less\nthan twice the normal limit. The use of calcimimetics in children on dialysis has been limited and not\nwell studied. The patient in this vignette has a PTH level in the lower normal range, therefore\nsuppressed. This would be consistent with adynamic bone disease in this population, a possible\neffect from hypercalcemia, but after a prolonged period of decreased bone turnover, may also be a\ncontributing cause to the hypercalcemia. The addition of a calcimimetic agent (choice A), although\nhaving the side effect of lowering serum calcium levels, would be contraindicated in this scenario\nbecause it would lower the PTH level further and worsen the patient’s bone disease.\nLastly, hypercalcemia can occur in dialysis patients for other reasons besides excess exposure to\nvitamin D analogs, enteral calcium, or dialysate calcium, although these etiologies are now\nexceedingly rare in the pediatric population. Excess vitamin A exposure or the use of thiazide\ndiuretics causes hypercalcemia in adult patients and would best be treated with discontinuation of\nthese medications. Aluminum toxicity historically has been a cause of hypercalcemia, when\naluminum-containing phosphate binders were primarily used. Aluminum deposition in the bone would\ncause decreased bone turnover and not allow for calcium to re-deposit into the bone, causing\nelevated serum levels. Similarly, patients with significant immobilization and decreased bone turnover\nmay also become hypercalcemic. Malignancies have been associated with hypercalcemia in adult\ndialysis patients, from lytic bone lesions, excessive active vitamin D formation, or the production of\nPTH-related protein from the tumor cells.

During the first week\nafter birth, the infant underwent a spontaneous diuresis followed by improved oxygenation and a rise\nin serum sodium concentration consistent with water diuresis.\nThere is a consensus among studies of renal function in premature infants with RDS that renal\nplasma flow (measured by para-aminohippuric acid clearance) and glomerular filtration rate\n(measured by inulin or creatinine clearance) are both depressed in the early phase of RDS. During\nthis period (days 1-3 after birth), the infant appears slightly edematous, sodium concentrations are\nslightly low, urine output is less than 1 mL/kg/h, and O requirements are relatively high. In the\n2\nabsence of confounding factors such as intraventricular hemorrhage, hemodynamically significant\npatent ductus arteriosus, or sepsis, the premature infant undergoes a spontaneous diuresis (usually\ntripling of the urine flow rate) on days 3 to 5 after birth, followed by weight loss, normalization of\nserum sodium, and a marked in improvement in O requirement and ventilatory support. During this\n2\ndiuretic phase, plasma vasopressin levels remain unchanged (choice B), and renal plasma flow and\nglomerular filtration rate increase significantly. Initial studies suggested that the improved renal\nhemodynamics mediate the spontaneous diuresis in neonatal RDS. However, later studies that\nexamined the temporal correlation between urine flow rate and renal hemodynamics found that the\nincrease in glomerular filtration rate persisted even after the resolution of the diuretic phase (choice\nC). Also, careful analysis of urinary osmotic and water clearances conducted before, during, and\nafter the spontaneous diuresis phase concluded that the spontaneous diuresis is caused by\nincreased free water clearance (adjusted for glomerular filtration rate). Presumably, the free water\ndiuresis represents the renal response to the endogenous water load resulting from the\nintracellular/extracellular fluid shift after birth (choice A). Osmolar clearance remains unchanged\nduring the diuretic phase of RDS (choice D).\nPREP Pearls\n Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome is accompanied by altered renal hemodynamics including low renal\nplasma flow and glomerular filtration rate, independent of changes in systemic hemodynamics.\n All infants, regardless of age, undergo spontaneous postnatal diuresis.\n Although it coincides temporally with increased glomerular filtration, the spontaneous diuresis of neonatal\nrespiratory distress syndrome is caused by enhanced tubular free water clearance in an attempt to excrete the\nendogenous water load.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the effects of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome on renal function\nSuggested Readings\n Costarino AT, Baumgart S, Norman ME, Polin RA.

Pediatr Res. 2010 Aug;68(2):91-8.\nIn this patient, intrauterine growth restriction is the most likely cause of the small kidneys because the\ninfant has a history of intrauterine growth retardation, which is associated with renal hypoplasia. In the\nabsence of family history or abnormal physical findings, a PAX2 mutation (associated with autosomal\ndominant renal-coloboma syndrome and renal hypoplasia) is less likely in this infant. Although\nprematurity can lead to a decreased nephron number, this infant was only mildly premature (36\n\nweeks’ gestation), at which time ureteric bud branching is complete. Maternal vitamin A deficiency is\nassociated with renal hypoplasia but is more likely in a underdeveloped country.\nThere are 3 primitive kidneys that form during human kidney development: the pronephros,\nmesonephros, and metanephros. The pronephros forms at 3 weeks’ gestation and consists of simple\ntubules that involute. The mesonephros forms caudal to the pronephros and consists of glomeruli and\ntubules that filter. As these involute, the mesonephros forms the mesonephric duct (Wolffian duct).\nThe ureteric bud is an outgrowth of the mesonephric duct that invades the surrounding metanephric\nmesenchyme during the fifth week of gestation. The ureteric bud undergoes branching. The number\nand pattern of the branches determine the pattern of the adult kidney and the nephron number.\nReciprocal signaling between the ureteric bud branches and the surrounding cap mesenchyme is\nrequired for proper branching and induction of formation of epithelial nephron structures at the tips of\nthe ureteric bud branches. These epithelial structures (first a renal vesicle, then the comma and S-\nshape body) will form the glomeruli, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, and distal tubules of the\nnephrons. The branching ureteric bud forms the collecting ducts, calyces, renal pelvis, ureter, and\nbladder trigone.\nUreteric bud outgrowth from the mesonephric duct and branching morphogenesis are regulated by\nmultiple cell signaling pathways. Defects in ureteric bud outgrowth can result in congenital anomalies,\nsuch as renal agenesis (if signals from the ureteric bud do not reach the metanephric mesenchyme,\nthe metanephric mesenchyme undergoes apoptosis) or duplicated kidneys or collecting systems (if\nmultiple ureteric buds grow from the mesonephric duct). In addition, buds that form too superiorly or\ninferiorly may fail to connect to the bladder properly, leading to ureterovesical junction obstruction or\nvesicoureteral reflux. Defects in branching morphogenesis can also result in a spectrum of renal\ndefects, including low nephron number, renal hypoplasia, and ureteropelvic junction obstruction.\nThe ureteric bud undergoes iterative branching. In the mouse, the ureteric bud initially bifurcates.\nEach tip then trifurcates, but branching afterward is mostly bifurcation at orthogonal angles (ie, the\nplane of each successive bifurcation shifts by 90°). Microenvironments, including the surrounding\nheparan sulfate extracellular matrix, likely contribute to this process by enabling the ureteric bud tips\nto differentiate from the stalk. The ureteric bud tip cells appear to have a self-renewing population of\ncells that divide to form ureteric bud trunk and tip cells. In this model, new ureteric bud branches form\nwhen localized growth factors promote budding with an apical actin cytoskeleton “purse-string”\nmechanism. Cessation of budding in this model is induced by differentiation of the surround\nmetanephric mesenchyme (changing the microenvironment) and possibly also by changes in the\nextracellular matrix.\nUreteric bud branching and nephron induction continue until 28 to 36 weeks’ gestation. Thus,\nnephron number is established at birth. Body weight is associated with nephron number, and low birth\nweight and intrauterine growth restriction are associated with decreased nephron number in humans.\nStudies of premature infants (born before 36 weeks’ gestation) indicate that although some new\nnephrons form after birth, nephron formation terminates early, leading to low nephron number. Low\nnephron number is a risk factor for proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage\nkidney disease (ESKD) in adulthood. Thus, abnormalities in ureteric branching morphogenesis can\nlead to childhood CKD/ESKD attributable to congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract or\ncontribute to adult-onset CKD/ESKD.\nOne of the major molecular signaling pathways regulating both ureteric bud outgrowth and branching\nis glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)/Ret signaling. GDNF is a secreted ligand that is\nsynthesized by the metanephric mesenchyme. Proper GDNF expression in the metanephric\nmesenchyme requires multiple transcription factors, including SALL1 (mutations lead to Townes-\nBrocks syndrome of imperforate anus, dysplastic ears, thumb malformations, and renal\n\nanomalies), SIX1/5 or EYA1 (mutations lead to branchiootorenal syndrome), or PAX2 (mutations lead\nto renal coloboma syndrome). Loss of GDNF expression in mice results in failure of ureteric bud\noutgrowth and renal agenesis. Similarly, RET mutations are associated with renal agenesis in\nhumans. GDNF binds the Ret receptor, which is concentrated at the tip of the ureteric bud. Ret\nexpression is stimulated by vitamin A (retinoic acid). The Ret receptor is a tyrosine kinase that has a\ncoreceptor (GDNF family receptor α1 [GFRα1]). Binding by GDNF to Ret/GFRα1 leads to\ndimerization of the receptor and phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine domains that activates the\nintracellular signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide-3-\nkinase. These intracellular signaling pathways drive cell proliferation, actin cytoskeleton\nrearrangement, cell-matrix adhesion, and cell migration that all contribute to ureteric bud outgrowth\nand branching. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Sprouty, is required to restrict the location of outgrowth\nand the number of ureteric buds. Genetic deletion of Sprouty in mice leads to ectopic and\nsupernumerary ureteric buds. Interestingly, if both GDNF and its signaling inhibitor Sprouty are\ndeleted in mice, fibroblast growth factor signaling can compensate and induce ureteric bud outgrowth.\nNeural guidance factors Slit2/Robo2 also regulate ureteric bud outgrowth locations, and mutations in\nthese are associated with vesicoureteral reflux in humans. The transcription factor Foxc1/2 restricts\nGDNF expression and thereby ureteric bud outgrowth. FOXC2 mutations are associated with\nlymphedema-distichiasis syndrome in humans, which may include renal anomalies, such as duplex\nkidneys.\nGDNF/Ret signaling is also a key mediator of ureteric bud branching. The high concentration of Ret at\nureteric bud tips appears to drive cellular rearrangements required for branching morphogenesis.\nMany other signaling pathways can modulate branching morphogenesis. Some are inhibitory (eg,\ntransforming growth factor β superfamily proteins activin and bone morphogenic proteins), others are\nstimulatory (eg, tyrosine kinases, vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and\nhepatocyte growth factor). In addition, the heparan sulfate proteoglycan content of the extracellular\nmatrix has also been shown to modulate branching (likely via effects on localization and activity of\nbound growth factors). Angiotensin II also stimulates ureteric bud branching. Wnt signaling (likely\ncanonical β-catenin mediated) modulates ureteric bud branching. Wnt planar cell polarity signaling\nhas a minor effect on ureteric bud branching but is required for ureteric bud elongation. Sonic\nhedgehog signaling affects ureteric bud branching (likely indirectly via effects on the metanephric\nmesenchyme and stroma) but also contributes to ureteral smooth muscle differentiation.\nThe fetal environment also affects ureteric bud branching (Table 2). For example, rodent models of\nplacental insufficiency lead to decreased nephron number. Although mechanisms have not been\nelucidated for all factors, it is likely that some are mediated by effects on the above molecular\nsignaling pathways (eg, maternal vitamin A deficiency likely affects Ret expression).\nPREP Pearls\n Branching morphogenesis determines the pattern and number of nephrons.\n Branching morphogenesis determines the pattern and number of nephrons.\n Defects in ureteric bud outgrowth and branching can lead to congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary\ntract, including renal agenesis, hypoplasia, duplicated kidneys or ureters, ureterovesical junction obstruction,\nand vesicoureteral reflux.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the principles of branching morphogenesis in kidney development\n\nSuggested Readings\n Cain JE, Di Giovanni V, Smeeton J, Rosenblum ND.

Renal vein thrombosis occurs most\ncommonly in neonates and rarely occurs in ambulatory children. The children who develop renal vein\nthrombosis usually have one or more underlying risk factors. The newborn in this vignette has\ncongenital nephrotic syndrome, which leads to a hypercoagulable state. The acute volume\ncontraction from diarrhea has lead to sluggish blood flow in his renal venous system and subsequent\nthrombosis. The clinical picture of acute kidney injury, hypertension, gross hematuria, and acute\nthrombocytopenia is classic for renal vein thrombosis. Other risk factors have been associated with\nrenal vein thrombosis. Classically, children will have an indwelling umbilical venous catheter that\nserves as the nidus for thrombus formation. Birth asphyxia, maternal diabetes, and polycythemia are\nalso risk factors. Children with renal vein thrombosis should be evaluated for abnormalities that can\nlead to thrombosis, such as deficiencies in factor V Leiden, protein S, protein C, or antithrombin III, or\nthe presence of lupus anticoagulant, especially when there is no obvious etiology of the thrombosis.\nThe approach to the patient with suspected renal vein thrombosis should include renal\nultrasonography with Doppler. Classic findings on ultrasonography include a hyperechoic cortex with\nloss of corticomedullary differentiation. The renal vein may not be collapsible. Doppler amplitudes\nmay be blunted with absent or severely diminished intrarenal and renal venous flow. Therefore, a\ndecreased Doppler amplitude of venous flow would correlate to the clinical picture of renal vein\nthrombosis as described in this vignette. Although a renal mass could lead to some of the clinical\nfindings presented, the abrupt nature of this clinical scenario as well as the predisposing factors do\nnot support a renal mass as the most likely finding. An obstruction with infection could manifest itself\nas gross hematuria, but the severe thrombocytopenia and hypertension are more likely to be\nsecondary to renal vein thrombosis than urinary tract infection. Normal newborn ultrasonography may\nreveal pronounced lobulations with normal corticomedullary differentiation and would not be expected\nin the case of acute renal vein thrombosis with acute kidney injury.\nThe best treatment for renal vein thrombosis is unclear. Generally, intravascular volume expansion,\nespecially in patients with dehydration, is indicated. The use of fibrinolytics and anticoagulation has\nnot been extensively studied in controlled trials to assess for a true benefit, especially in patients\nwithout acute kidney injury. Data from existing studies is conflicting and does not provide a universal\napproach for anticoagulation use in renal vein thrombosis. In general, infants with unilateral renal vein\nthrombosis can be managed conservatively, without anticoagulation or fibrinolytics. If an indwelling\numbilical venous catheter is present, it should be removed. If there is extension into the inferior vena\ncava, anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin is often considered.\nFor infants with bilateral renal vein thrombosis, both heparin and fibrinolytic therapies may be\nindicated. Consultation with hematology is warranted to discuss each case. These patients are at\nhigh risk for long-term renal damage, so nephrology follow-up is indicated in all cases.\nPREP Pearls\n Gross hematuria and thrombocytopenia in a patient at risk for thrombosis warrants an evaluation for renal vein\nthrombosis.\n There is insufficient clinical trial data to decisively warrant a role for anticoagulation in patients with renal vein\nthrombosis.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Plan the appropriate evaluation of an occluded renal vein\n Know the current therapy/intervention for an occluded renal artery\n\nSuggested Readings\n Ismaili K, Avni FE, Hall M.

In preterm neonates,\nthese functional limitations are even more pronounced, and the functions take a longer time to\nmature. The functional limitations are predominantly related to diminished expression and activity of\nthe tubular epithelial cell basolateral membrane sodium-potassium ATPase that drives tubular\nreabsorptive and secretory functions.\nNeonates, especially preterm neonates, have decreased functional capacity for sodium-glucose\ncotransport in the proximal convoluted tubule and develop renal glycosuria at a lower serum glucose\nthreshold, including normal serum glucose levels. Similarly, the proximal convoluted tubule sodium-\nhydrogen exchanger and distal nephron acid secretion mechanisms are limited; therefore, neonates\nnormally have a serum bicarbonate level in the 16 to 22 mEq/L (16-22 mmol/L) range, rather than the\nadult normal range. The presence of renal glycosuria and a serum bicarbonate of 17 mEq/L (17\nmmol/L) is consistent with normal renal tubular function parameters in a preterm neonate and is not\nsuggestive of a chronic proximal convoluted tubular disorder.\nSerum potassium levels are normally higher in neonates than in older children because of limitations\non distal nephron potassium secretion caused by physiologic aldosterone resistance. Similarly, serum\nphosphorous levels are typically higher in neonates than in older children and adults. Phosphate is an\nessential mineral needed for growth and the developing skeletal system, and phosphate reabsorptive\nmechanisms are higher in neonates such that they typically reabsorb greater than 90% of the filtered\nphosphate in the first weeks after birth. Neonatal creatinine levels reflect the maternal creatinine\nlevel. The creatinine level should gradually decrease to the levels reflective of the neonatal\nglomerular filtration rate; however, this process may take 4 to 6 weeks in preterm neonates. At 3\nweeks of age, a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL (46 µmol/L) likely reflects a level that is gradually\ndecreasing to the neonate’s steady state from the maternal steady state. Mild proteinuria in\npremature neonates is a result of impaired proximal renal tubular reabsorption of filtered protein. In\nview of the prematurity of the neonate in this vignette, the serum potassium, phosphorous, and\ncreatinine levels and the trace proteinuria are appropriate and not suggestive of acute kidney injury.\nNephrocalcinosis, which refers to the deposition of calcium in renal tubulointerstitium, may develop in\npreterm neonates, particularly neonates who are extremely premature or have a very low birth weight.\nThe premature kidney is a favorable environment for calcium deposition because of the lower tubular\nflow rate, lower glomerular filtration rate, and a disproportionate use of the deeper and medullary\nnephrons where the filtrate is more concentrated. The high intake needs of preterm infants for\ncalcium and phosphate for their developing skeletal system, together with potential complications of\nsevere lung disease treated with loop diuretics, corticosteroids, or both, may exacerbate the tendency\nfor nephrocalcinosis. Importantly, related to renal tubular immaturity, urine calcium levels are higher in\nneonates and infants as compared to older children. For these reasons, calcium oxalate crystals,\nwith associated microscopic hematuria, may be seen in preterm neonates. Microscopic hematuria\nmay also be a result of bladder catheterization. Therefore, the nephrocalcinosis and calcium oxalate\ncrystals may be a transient problem; as the lung disease improves, calcium intake requirements\ndecrease, and renal tubular functions mature, the neonate may not be at increased risk for\nnephrocalcinosis or kidney stones in the future.\nPREP Pearls\n Neonates, especially preterm neonates, have immature glomerular and renal tubular functions as compared to\nolder infants and children, resulting in slight differences in normal serum and urine laboratory values.\n\n Neonates (including preterm neonates) have a higher reabsorptive capacity for phosphate, resulting in higher\nphosphate levels than in older children and adults.\n Nephrocalcinosis, calcium oxalate crystals, and/or higher urine calcium levels are common but most often\ntemporary findings in preterm neonates; these conditions are related to immature renal tubular function, high\ncalcium intake requirements, and complications from comorbid lung disease.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Be able to diagnose and manage different conditions associated with other urinalysis abnormalities in the\nnewborn\n Know the gestational age-appropriate renal function indices for preterm and term infants\nSuggested Readings\n Avner ED, Harmon WE, Niaudet P, Yoshikawa N, Emma F, Goldstein SL, eds.

    "explanation": "B. biallelic disease\nCystinuria is caused by defective resorption of cysteine in the proximal tubule. The cystine transport\nmechanism is a heterodimer composed of a heavy unit (rBAT protein coded for by the SLC3A1 gene)\nand a light unit (b[0,+] amino acid transporter protein coded for by the SLC7A9 gene). The subunits\nare connected by a disulfide bridge, and the transporter moves intraluminal cysteine into the cell,\nwhere the disulfide bond connecting the 2 cysteine molecules is hydrolyzed. The cysteine molecules\nthen move across the basolateral membrane into the blood.\nCystinuria can be caused by mutations in SLC7A9 and SLC3A1. It is typically inherited in an\nautosomal recessive fashion. Approximately half the patients have mutations in SLC7A9, whereas a\nlittle less than half the patients have mutations in SLC3A1. Overall, the phenotype is not dictated by\nwhich gene is mutated. Approximately 2% of patients have bigenic disease with mutations in\nboth SLC7A9 and SLC3A1.\nHistorically, cystinuria was classified based on the parents’ urinary cystine excretion. Those patients\nwith parents having normal urinary cystine excretion were classified as having type I, those with\nparents having grossly elevated excretion as type II (non–type I), and those with parents having\nintermediate urinary cystine excretion as type III (non–type I). Interestingly some of the parents with\nelevated urinary cystine excretion (non–type I) have cystine stones (therefore have the autosomal\ndominant phenotype).\nThe current genetic classification is described in the Table.\nReprinted with permission from Claes DJ, Jackson E. Cystinuria: mechanisms and management. Pediatr Nephrol. 2012. Nov,\n27(11).2031-8\nThe presence of the SLC3A1 mutation alone does not cause dominant disease. Thus, the mother\nlikely has an SLC7A9 mutation. Overall, cystine renal stones occur more frequently in males\ncompared with females. In a study of cystinuric patients in Europe, males had one stone\napproximately every 3 years, whereas females had one stone approximately every 5 years. The age\n\nat onset between males and females is similar at approximately 12 years of age; however, in those\nwith early stones in the first 3 years of life, there is a strong male predominance.\nAs mentioned above, because of the mother’s stone, the patient likely has at least\none SLC7A9 mutation. As shown in the Table, he likely has an additional mutated allele\nin SLC7A9 or SLC3A1, contributing to his disease. With his severe phenotype, it is unlikely he has\nonly one mutation in SLC7A9, and SLC7A9 is not on the X-chromosome.\nThe components of the cystine transport mechanism in the gastrointestinal tract are the same as the\nkidney. In cystinuria, there is decreased intestinal absorption of cystine and other dibasic amino\nacids, but this does not result in discernible disease because of the intestines’ ability to absorb small\noligopeptides containing cystine. There are, however, patients with homozygous deletions in\nchromosome 2, which result in the deletion of the SLC3A1 gene and cause cystinuria. The\nsyndromes include 2p21 deletion syndrome, hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome, and atypical hypotonia-\ncystinuria syndrome. In addition to hypotonia and cystinuria, these patients have intellectual disability\n(mental retardation), facial abnormalities, poor feeding, and growth retardation.\nPREP Pearls\n Cystinuria is caused by defective dibasic amino acid resorption in the proximal tubule.\n Cystinuria is typically but not always an autosomal recessive disease.\n The mean age of first stone is approximately 12 years old.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the molecular genetic basis for the different forms of cystinuria\nSuggested Readings\n Boutros M, Vicanek C, Rozen R, Goodyer P.

    "explanation": "B. conditional NPHS2-driven XYZ knockout mice\nThe vignette describes a hypothetical scenario in which homozygous mutations that involve a STOP\ncodon in an early exon of a gene that fully associates with the development of disease. This scenario\nis most likely to be associated with loss of function of that gene. Of the responses given, the best\napproach to study loss of function of that gene specifically in podocytes would be to examine mice\nwith podocyte-specific deletion of that gene (conditional NPHS2-driven XYZ knockout mice). Although\ngermline XYZ knockout mice (XYZ−/−) will also give information about loss-of-gene function, this\napproach does not allow one to assess the podocyte-specific role of the gene. In addition, there is a\nsignificant risk that the mice may be embryonic lethal (given the history of fetal loss in the affected\nfamily). Doxycycline-inducible overexpression of XYZ would overexpress the gene. However,\nbecause the gene mutations are likely to result in loss of function (not gain of function), this is not the\npreferred response. Conditional AQP2-driven XYZ knockout mice would have deletion of the gene in\nprincipal cells. Because the investigator wants to study the effect specifically on the podocyte, this is\nnot the best approach.\nKnockout and transgenic mouse models have been fundamental to improving our understanding of\nnormal development and mechanisms of renal disease. First, mouse kidneys are more similar to\nhuman kidneys than lower order organisms, such as zebrafish (which have a pronephros). Second,\nthere is a broad understanding of mouse genetics and many available mice for gene manipulation in\nthe kidney. Third, there are many mouse models of renal disease, including acute kidney injury (eg,\nischemia reperfusion injury), glomerular injury (eg, streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy), and\nchronic kidney disease (eg, unilateral ureteral obstruction). This allows investigators to test the effect\nof genes on development of renal disease.\nKnockout mice refer to mutant mice that do not express a gene. Knockout mutant mice are a powerful\ntool to understand the effect of a gene on the living organism. There are 2 approaches to generated\nknockout mice: gene targeting and gene trapping.\nGene targeting uses homologous recombination. Homologous recombination is exchange of genetic\nmaterial between 2 similar regions of DNA, as occurs during meiosis. First, early embryonic stem\n(ES) cells are harvested from a pregnant mouse (4 days after conception). Second, fragments of\nDNA with both ends homologous to the gene of interest are introduced into the ES cells. Typically,\nthe DNA fragment is designed to be homologous to an early exon of the gene of interest. Gene\ndisruption to an early exon will likely lead to no protein expression and complete loss of function\n(disruption of a later exon may lead to expression of a truncated protein that could retain some\nfunction). Between the regions of homology is a selection cassette (a gene for antibiotic resistance).\nThird, the ES cells are grown on antibiotic-coated plates, allowing only those ES cells that have\nincorporated the DNA cassette to survive. DNA is introduced into the ES cells by a variety of means,\nincluding electroporation (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Generation of knockout mice: The initial step of knockout mice generation\nCourtesy of K. Reidy Based on data collected from\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Knockou\nFourth, DNA sequencing is performed to confirm that the cassette was incorporated in the proper\nposition and orientation.\nIn gene trapping, DNA carrying a reporter is randomly inserted into ES cell DNA. In addition to\ncarrying a reporter, the DNA trap vector is designed to disrupt gene expression. For example, some\nDNA trap vectors contain DNA that disrupts RNA splicing. Gene trapping is a high-throughput, large-\nscale approach to generate many knockout mutants. There have been several consortia (eg,\nInternational Mouse Phenotype Consortium, National Institutes of Health Knockout Mouse Project)\nthat have developed thousands of mutant ES cells that can then be used to generate knockout mice.\nKnockout ES cells from either gene trapping or gene targeting are then injected into early-stage\nmouse embryos, and the chimeric embryos are implanted into pseudopregnant mice (female mice\nmated with vasectomized male mice). Often, the knockout ES cells are generated from mice of one\ncolor (eg, white fur) and are injected into ES cells from mice of a different fur color (eg, brown). The\ninitial offspring will be chimeras (some ES cells will be wild type and others knockout). The chimeras\nare bred with wild-type mice to yield heterozygous knockout (again, coat color can help identify the\nheterozygous knockout mice).\nThere are some disadvantages of knockout mice. First, it is expensive and time-consuming to\ngenerate the mice. Second, there is the potential for many gene knockouts (estimated 15%) to be\nembryonic lethal. This would preclude study of the effect on the adult kidney and possibly even on the\ndeveloping kidney (if the lethality occurs before kidney development). Third, all cells are affected,\nsometimes making it difficult to distinguish which cell type is leading to the observed phenotype. For\nexample, if a knockout mouse of a ubiquitously expressed protein is protected from renal ischemia\nperfusion–induced acute kidney injury, the protection could be mediated by multiple cell types,\nincluding renal tubular epithelial, inflammatory, or endothelial cells.\n\nTransgenic mice are mice in which a new piece of DNA is introduced into the mouse’s genome.\nTransgenic mice with conditional gene deletion can be useful to avoid embryonic lethality and to\nelucidate cell-specific effects. One of the most common mechanisms for generating conditional\ndeletion is the use of the cre-lox system (Figure 2 ).\nFigure 2: Cell specific gene deletion with Cre-lox recombination\nCourtesy of K. Reidy\nCre recombinase (Cre) is an enzyme expressed by bacteriophage (and thus is normally not\nexpressed in mice) that recognizes lox-P DNA sequences (flox sites). Cre excises the DNA between\nthe flox sites. With approaches similar to that of generating knockout mice, transgenic mice can be\ngenerated that express Cre under cell-specific promoters. As in the vignette, a promoter for a\npodocyte protein podocin (NPHS2) will result in podocyte-specific expression. A second mouse is\ngenerated with lox-P sites flanking early exons of the gene of interest. Individually, both mice should\nbe normal and express normal amounts of the gene. The 2 mice are bred together, resulting in cell-\nspecific Cre expression (eg, in the podocyte) that will recognize the flox sites and excise the DNA,\nleading to cell-specific gene deletion. The timing of gene deletion will also be specific to the timing of\nthe promoter (eg, gene deletion will occur at the time when podocin is expressed in the developing\npodocyte).\nTransgenic mice can also be used to overexpress a gene. Both overexpression and conditional\ndeletion can be made time specific and inducible by generating transgenic mice in which the promoter\nexpression requires exposure to a medication, such as tetracycline/doxycycline or tamoxifen. For\nexample, some transgenic mice have been engineered with promoters with tetracycline responsive\nelements that require binding of a reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) together with\ntetra/doxycycline to be activated (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3: rtTA-tet-O mice can be used for doxycycline induced cell specific transgene expression: Only in the\nprescence of doxycycline (orange) and rtTA (expressed in this case podocytes under the NPHS2 promoter) will the\ntransgene (green) be expressed\nCourtesy of K. Reidy\nThe mice have the rtTA expressed under a cell-specific promoter (eg, NPHS2). The mice are then\ngiven doxycycline in their food or water. Doxycycline allows the rtTA to bind the tet-ON (tet-O)\npromoter to allow the transgene to be expressed. For example, feeding doxycycline to NPHS2-\nrtTa:tet-O-XYZ mice would overexpress the XYZ gene in the podocyte.\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas is a newer technology being\nused to modify the mouse genome (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4: CRISPR gene editing: A single guide RNA (sgRNA) leads to Cas9 endonuclease cleavage of double\nstranded DNA. If the DNA break is repaired by the error prone Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), loss of function\nmutants can be obtained due to frameshift or deletions. If gene editing is desired, a homologous repair DNA strand is\nintroduced that carries a few base pair changes. This allows for repair by the Homology Directed Repair (HDR)\npathway.\nReprinted with permission from Ran FA, Hsu PD, Wright J, Agarwala V, Scott DA, Zhang F. Genome engineering\nusing the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Nat Protoc. 2013;8(11):2281-2308. doi:10.1038/nprot.2013.143.\nThis gene-editing technique uses machinery from bacteria that allows them to resist infections from\nviruses (bacteriophage). The CRISPR/Cas system consists of a guiding oligonucleotide (guide RNA)\nand an endonuclease (Cas9). The guide RNA is a 20-nucleotide sequence. The Cas9 endonuclease\nonly cleaves DNA upstream of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Thus, the guide RNA is designed\nto include both scaffold RNA (that binds Cas9) and a targeting RNA sequence that is upstream of a\nPAM, which will result in sequence-specific double-stranded DNA breakage.\nThis process can be used for gene editing in 1 of 2 ways. The DNA break can repair by the\nnonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. The NHEJ pathway often results in deletion or\nframeshifts and thus can be used to generate a loss-of-function mutant. Alternatively, in the gene-\nediting approach, a homologous DNA sequence (with only a few base pair changes) can be\nintroduced in the the cell with CRISPR/Cas9 to allow for repair by the homology-directed repair\npathway. This approach allows DNA to be engineered with point mutations (eg, human mutations\nassociated with a disease). In addition, this approach can be used to generate a conditional mutant\nby adding a flox site. CRISPR/Cas9 can be used for cells and other organisms, as well as mouse\ngenome editing, and has the advantage of being quicker and less expensive that traditional\napproaches to generation of knockout mice.\nPREP Pearls\n Knockout mice are powerful tools to examining a gene function but can be limited if the gene deletion causes\nembryonic lethality.\n Transgenic mice can be used to generate conditional deletion models, allowing for cell-specific effects of a\ngene to be studied.\n CRISPR technology allows for more rapid generation of knockout or conditional deletion mouse models and for\ngene editing and study of point mutations.\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the use of transgenic animals and homologous recombination, as well as the limitations of these\ntechniques\nSuggested Readings\n García-Otín AL, Guillou F.

As Fabry disease is an X-linked\ndisorder, there may be greater variability in the phenotypic expression of the disease in female\npatients as well as the production of αGalA. Therefore, measurement of αGalA levels (choice A) is\nmuch less specific in diagnosing Fabry disease in female “carriers,” unlike in male individuals who are\ndiagnosed by decreased plasma or leukocyte levels of αGalA. However, a kidney biopsy (choice B)\nmay be diagnostically helpful in someone with overt renal findings that indicate the need for biopsy.\nCulture of fibroblasts obtained by skin biopsy is an alternate method of diagnosis if other methods are\nnot available. Additionally, there has been investigation into serum levels of globotriaosylsphingosine\n(lyso-Gb3) (choice D), another accumulated by-product in Fabry disease, as an indicator of more\nclinically significant disease, especially in individuals with αGalA mutations of unknown significance.\nFabry disease, also referred to as Anderson-Fabry disease, is a lysosomal storage disorder caused\nby an inborn deficiency of αGalA, which breaks down the glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide\n(Gb3) within the lysosome as part of the normal recycling of cellular components.\nGlobotriaosylceramide is the receptor on the vascular endothelium to which Shiga toxin binds in\nhemolytic uremic syndrome. The inability to catabolize Gb3 results in its progressive accumulation\nthroughout the body, not just in the kidneys; this accumulation may cause cellular dysfunction within\nthe vascular endothelium and smooth muscle in other regions in addition to cells of the nervous\nsystem, myocardium, skin, bowel, eyes, ears, and kidneys. With such disparate organ systems\naffected by Fabry disease, there is a wide and seemingly unrelated variety of symptoms that make\ndiagnosis difficult.\nThe symptoms of Fabry disease usually appear, sometimes subtly, during childhood and\nadolescence. The classic early symptoms (Table) are a burning sensation of the hands and/or feet\n(acroparesthesia), lack of sweating (hypohidrosis or anhidrosis), temperature intolerance,\ntelangiectatic changes to the skin, and abdominal pain.\nTable. Typical Signs and Symptoms of Fabry Disease According to Age.\nChildhood and adolescence (≤ 16 years of age)\n● Neuropathic pain (acroparesthesia)\n● Angiokeratomas\n● Dyshidrosis (hypohidrosis and hyperhidrosis)\n● Hypersensitivity to heat and cold\n● Gastrointestinal disturbances and abdominal pain\n● Lethargy and fatigue\n● Ophthalmologic abnormalities, especially cornea verticillata\n● Hearing impairment ● Microalbuminuria, abnormal heart rate variability\nEarly adulthood (17-30 years of age)\n● Progression of any of the above signs and symptoms\n● Proteinuria and progressive decline in renal function\n● Renal sinus cyst development\n● Cardiomyopathy\n● Transient ischemic attacks or strokes\n● Facial dysmorphic changes\nCourtesy of R. VanDeVoorde\nBased on data from suggested readings\nAs the disease progresses, more significant manifestations may develop, such as proteinuria,\ndecreased renal function, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac conduction issues, transient ischemic\n\nattacks, and strokes. These later findings are the primary causes of premature death in patients with\nFabry disease.\nWith such protean symptoms, the average time from symptom presentation to the diagnosis of Fabry\ndisease was reported as almost 15 years in an early review of the disorder. With increased\nawareness of the disorder over the past decade, this delay in diagnosis is shorter, but is still greater\nthan 3 years in male patients and even longer in female patients. With the availability of enzyme\nreplacement therapy to halt the progression of significant organ dysfunction, an earlier diagnosis of\nthis rare disorder is critical to prevent disease morbidity.\nMost lysosomal storage disorders, like Gaucher disease and cystinosis, have an autosomal recessive\ninheritance pattern. However, GLA, which encodes αGalA, is located on the long arm of the X\nchromosome (Xq22.1), making Fabry disease one of the few glycosphingolipidoses with an X-linked\ninheritance pattern. Hemizygous male individuals typically develop classical Fabry disease with its\nmyriad of symptoms. The severity of symptoms in heterozygous female “carriers” ranges from\nasymptomatic to equivalent to the severity seen in male individuals. The symptoms in female\nindividuals may be milder in severity, later in onset, or with less rapid progression, but the disease\ncan still cause significant morbidity and shortening of life expectancy. The underlying mechanism\nwhereby female individuals develop symptoms as significant as in their male counterparts is\nunknown, as most can have almost normal levels of circulating αGalA. Variables other than random\nlyonization are responsible for the variation in the disease seen in female individuals, because there\nis also significant interfamilial variability among male individuals with Fabry disease.\nBecause Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder, the method to confirm its diagnosis varies between\nmale and female individuals. In male individuals, the diagnosis is confirmed by enzymatic analysis of\nplasma or leukocyte αGalA levels (choice A), with leukocyte levels being more sensitive than plasma\nlevels. Levels are undetectable in a majority of male patients with hallmark symptoms and are less\nthan 4% of the normal level in the remainder. However, female carriers of Fabry disease can have\nαGalA enzyme activity levels within the normal range, or only slightly decreased, so enzymatic\nanalysis is not the ideal test for them. For female patients, DNA analysis for mutations in GLA (choice\nC) is the recommended test for disease confirmation.\nOver 400 distinct mutations of GLA have been identified. Unlike most other genetic diseases, most\nkindred of Fabry disease have unique (or private) mutations, so that testing should not be for specific\nmutations. As more testing has been done, there has been discovery of greater variation of the Fabry\nphenotype, with renal and cardiac variants being noted without disease involvement of all of the other\norgans that is seen with classic Fabry disease. With the discovery of mutations causing atypical\nFabry disease, along with the noted interfamilial variation of the disease, it has become difficult to\nestablish a clear link between a certain genotype (mutation) and a disease phenotype (symptom\nseverity), but mutational analysis is still preferred for establishing whether disease is present.\nOther methods of testing for Fabry disease, and possible links with disease severity, have also been\nexplored. Plasma or urinary levels of Gb3 are not helpful to identify clinical manifestations or disease\nseverity in Fabry disease. However, a degradation product of Gb3, lyso-Gb3, has been associated\nwith greater pathogenicity of disease in patients with assorted GLA mutations. Although this may not\nbe the diagnostic standard for disease, serum lyso-Gb3 (choice D) may become a better standard to\nmeasure clinical relevance of disease, especially when family information is not available.\nAdditionally, lyso-Gb3 may be clinically helpful in male patients with atypical presentations or in\nfemale patients in which disease severity is more random.\nLastly, the diagnosis of Fabry disease can sometimes be made with other classical findings, although\nthese findings are not present in all patients with Fabry disease. Abnormalities of the cornea have\n\nbeen reported in 60% to 88% of children with Fabry disease, although these findings do not cause\nany visual symptoms. Cornea verticillata, a pattern of spiral streaks within the corneal epithelium\n(Figure 1), is a hallmark finding of Fabry disease, so its high specificity may be useful as a\nnoninvasive method to screen for the disease.\nFigure 1: Figure 1: Cornea verticillata\nReprinted with permission from Burlina AP, Sims KB, Politei JM, et al.

    "explanation": "C. the result is biased because the stratified results did not take race into account\nOne of the main goals of clinical research is to determine if an exposure or a patient characteristic is\nassociated with a disease causing risk factor or outcome. Information gleaned from such work can\nthen inform clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. There are several types of clinical\nresearch, each with its advantages and disadvantages, with the ideal design being the randomized\nclinical trial. Only during a RCT can one attempt to address causality (does this\nexposure/characteristic cause this disease process/outcome?). Other study designs – cohort studies\n(retrospective and prospective), cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, case-cohort studies –\nall measure associations between exposure and outcome, but cannot determine causality.\nWhile randomized clinical trials are considered the “gold standard”, there are many limitations to their\nuse including cost, time, and occasionally ethical considerations. When a RCT is not feasible,\nepidemiological study designs can be used. When designing, conducting and analyzing data from\nepidemiological studies, it is important to be mindful of potential biases that can adversely impact\nstudy validity.\nBias is defined as “any systematic error in the design, conduct or analysis of a study that results in a\nmistaken estimate of an exposure’s effect on the risk of the disease” (Schlesselman, JJ: Case-Control\nStudies: Design, Conduct, and Analysis. New York, Oxford University Press, 1982). There are\nseveral potential sources of bias in epidemiological studies, including selection bias, information bias,\nand confounding bias.\nConfounding is present when an observed association between an exposure and an outcome is\nactually due to another factor altogether and not because of a causal relationship between the\nexposure-outcome. As an example of this, early studies described an association between high\nlevels of coffee consumption and coronary artery disease. Later studies were able to demonstrate\nthat this observed association was confounded by smoking status: individuals who drink coffee are\nmore likely to smoke than those who do not drink coffee, and it was the coffee drinkers’ smoking\nstatus, not the exposure to coffee, that explained this observed relationship between coffee\nconsumption and coronary artery disease.\nOne of the ways in which confounding can be handled in epidemiological studies is by conducting\nmultivariable (adjusted) analyses. These statistical tests control for the presence of characteristics\nthat may be present and may cloud the true association between exposure and disease. The\nstatistical analyses attempt to answer the question, what is the association between the exposure and\noutcome independent of comorbid conditions/risk factors? Or, put another way, adjusting for potential\nconfounders in a statistical analysis attempts to determine the association between exposure and\noutcome among individuals when all else is equal.\n\nDue to concern for confounding, investigators often will include as many variables they can think of\nthat might be associated with the outcome. Others may conduct analyses to determine what\nvariables are associated with the outcome and include only those variables that reach statistical\nsignificance into the multivariable adjusted regression analysis. These are incorrect approaches. A\ncharacteristic or variable can only be considered a confounder if they meet the following criteria:\n1. It is associated with the exposure\n2. It is a risk factor for the outcome\n3. It is not on the causal pathway between exposure and outcome.\nWhen a characteristic is in the causal pathway, this is a mediator, not a confounder.\nAdjusting for a characteristic or variable on the causal pathway between exposure and outcome could\nerroneously reveal no association, leading to incorrect conclusions. And, adjusting for a\ncharacteristic or variable that is only associated with an outcome and not with the exposure can also\nlead to erroneous conclusions: you could potentially produce results that imply an association when in\ntruth there is no association.\nThere are several ways to address confounding in epidemiologic studies. In the planning stages,\ndesigning a case-control study where participants are matched on characteristics that are potential\nconfounders is one way to handle confounding. The statistical associations obtained will be\nindependent of the effect of any characteristic that was matched upon. Utilizing a randomized\ncontrolled trial is another strategy. Provided randomization is unbiased, the observed associations in\na RCT should be free of confounding due to the randomization process.\nOnce the study has been completed, confounding can be accounted for during statistical analyses: by\nstratified analyses (separating participants into groups based on a potential confounder, such as race,\nsex, age) or by adjustment, where regression analyses are conducted that include confounding\nvariables and produce output “independent of” the effects of these variables.\nIn the vignette above, the participants were stratified based on the exposure (overweight/obesity vs.\nnormal weight). Blood pressure was not found to be different between the groups. Race is known to\nbe associated with body mass index and blood pressure, and is not on the causal pathway (body\nmass index does not cause race which then causes blood pressure).\n\nRace therefore meets the criteria for a confounder and should be adjusted for in statistical\nanalyses. It is for this reason that response choice C is correct.\nWhile body mass index may not be as important in the pathogenesis of hypertension among children\nwith chronic kidney disease, the results described in the vignette do not support this conclusion due\nto concerns related to confounding. This makes response choice A incorrect. Response choice B is\nalso not entirely correct because length of time with overweight/obesity has not been addressed and\ncross-sectional analyses cannot answer the question of causality. Finally, response choice D is not\ncorrect. Instead, statistical analyses lose power when the comparator groups are extremely\nimbalanced, not when they are equal\nPREP Pearls\n A characteristic or variable can only be considered a confounder if they meet the following criteria:\n1. It is associated with the exposure\n2. It is a risk factor for the outcome\n3. It is not on the causal pathway between exposure and outcome.\n Confounding can be addressed in research either by study design (matching, randomized controlled trial) or by\nstatistical techniques (stratification, adjustment).\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Identify common strategies in study design to avoid or reduce confounding",

The deposition of mesangial C1q is an anticipated finding on\nimmunofluorescence staining in lupus nephritis. Polymorphonuclear infiltration of the glomerulus is\ntypical of postinfectious glomerulonephritis.\nHSP is defined by rash, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal disease, which can develop in any\norder and at any time during a period of several days to several months. Renal involvement is\ntypically noted within a few days to 1 month after the onset of systemic symptoms.

Light\nmicroscopy reveals a wide spectrum of glomerular changes, ranging from isolated mesangial\nproliferation to focal and segmental proliferation to severe crescentic glomerulonephritis. The major\nfinding on light microscopy is focal (involving <50% of glomeruli) or more often diffuse mesangial\nproliferation with matrix expansion (Figure 1). Biopsies in children with HSP nephritis often reveal\nsignificant mesangial hypercellularity, whereas adults often have increased matrix expansion with\nmore severe tubulointerstitial damage. Segmental crescents are relatively common, and segmental\nnecrosis with or without crescent formation may be present.

There is\nusually little or no glomerulosclerosis in children apparent on initial biopsy. Children may eventually\ndevelop glomerulosclerosis, by which time they have a decreased glomerular filtration rate with fixed\nproteinuria.\nOn immunofluorescence there is dominant or codominant IgA deposition of mainly IgA1 that is usually\nfound in the mesangium but in more severe cases can extend to the capillary loops. The number and\nsize of these deposits generally correlate well with the severity of changes seen on light microscopy.\nOf importance, there can also be IgG, IgM, fibrinogen, and C3 in the glomeruli by\nimmunofluorescence.

    "explanation": "A. glomerular hyperfiltration\nThe most likely reason for the microalbuminuria in the patient described in the vignette is glomerular\nhyperfiltration. Although increased creatinine secretion, impaired concentrating capacity, or defective\nhydrogen ion secretion are all renal manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD), the primary reason\nfor microalbuminuria in SCD is the combination of hyperfiltration and glomerular hypertension.\nSCD, which is estimated to affect 100 million persons worldwide, is an inherited blood disorder\ncharacterized by hemolytic anemia and recurrent vaso-occlusive crises. Renal involvement\ncontributes substantially to the diminished life expectancy of patients with SCD, accounting for 16% to\n18% of mortality.\nThere seems to be a time line for renal involvement in SCD, with impaired concentrating capacity\noccurring early in life. Hyperfiltration with high glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is seen in this period as\nwell. During childhood some patients develop microalbuminuria. Overt proteinuria develops in early\nand middle adulthood with normalization of GFR. In the later decades, risk of chronic kidney disease\nand end-stage kidney disease increase. Acute kidney injury (AKI) can occur at any age.\nSickle hemoglobin polymerizes when there is hypoxia, acidosis, and hyperosmolality. In addition,\nsickle hemoglobin B adheres to the endothelium because of membrane changes in the hemoglobin\nstructure, causing slowing of microvascular circulation, which further worsens sickling.\nA perfusion paradox has been ascribed to occur in SCD in the circulatory system (Figure).\nFigure: Salient pathogenetic processes in the development of sickle cell nephropathy Reprinted with permission\nfrom Ataga KI, Derebail VK, Archer DR. The glomerulopathy of sickle cell disease. Am J Hematol. 2014;89(9):907–\n914. doi:10.1002/ajh.23762.\n\nThere is hypoperfusion in the microcirculation caused by occlusion of sickle hemoglobin, whereas\nthere is hyperperfusion in the macrocirculation. This curious change of hyperfiltration and\nhypofiltration occurs in the kidney, where there is hyperfiltration of glomerulus and hypoperfusion of\nmedulla.\nGlomerular Hyperfiltration\nThe hyperfiltration that occurs in the glomeruli is chiefly due to an increased glomerular plasma flow\nrate. This increased flow rate is likely due to increase in the activity of renal vasodilators, such as\nprostaglandin and the heme oxygenase (HO1)–carbon monoxide system. The HO1 protein is induced\nin the kidneys and in the endothelium in SCD, likely due to hemolysis, oxidative stress, and\ninflammation. Carbon monoxide acts as a vasodilator and increases renal blood flow. This increased\nplasma flow is not due to anemia because it is not corrected by transfusion.\nMedullary Hypoperfusion\nMedullary blood flow is markedly reduced in SCD. There is substantial loss of vasa recta in the inner\nmedulla and distortion even in the remaining vessels of the vasa recta. Medullary milieu serves as the\nperfect setup for sickling of red blood cells in SCD because it is hypoxic and acidotic and has slower\nblood flow. In fact, this stasis can even progress to infarction but more commonly causes ischemia-\nreperfusion injury, promoting oxidative stress and inflammation.\nIn addition, levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFLT-1) are increased in SCD compared with\nhealthy age- and race-matched controls. sFLT-1 is a member of the vascular endothelial growth\nfactor (VEGF) receptor family. By antagonizing VEGF action and inhibiting Akt phosphorylation,\nsFLT-1 decreases nitric oxide bioavailability, thus leading to endothelial dysfunction.\nUltimately, this combination of hyperfiltration and glomerular hypertension is said to be important for\nthe development of glomerulosclerosis, causing albuminuria. Additional factors that can cause\nalbuminuria could be use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), chelating agents,\nnarcotics, episodes of infection, and episodes of AKI.\nThe proposed mechanisms of albuminuria in SCD are as follows:\n1. Hyperfiltration\n2. Glomerular hypertension\n3. Ischemia-reperfusion\n4. Increased levels of sFLT-1\n5. NSAIDs\n6. Opiate use\n7.

Sutherland, Kyungjoon Lim, Lina Gubhaju, Monika A.\nZimanyi, and M. Jane Black, “Low Birth Weight due to Intrauterine Growth Restriction and/or Preterm Birth: Effects on\nNephron Number and Long-Term\nMost of these factors share a common etiologic element, namely, reduced fetal blood flow, resulting\nin fetal hypoxia and undernutrition. The cause of IUGR varies, depending on geographic locations. In\ndeveloping countries, maternal undernutrition is the most significant cause of IUGR, whereas in\ndeveloped countries, placental insufficiency is the predominant cause of IUGR. Advanced maturation\nof nephron progenitors and nascent nephrons is a characteristic of the nephron defects in premature\ninfants not infants with IUGR.\nNephrogenesis is completed by 34 to 36 weeks of gestation. Autopsy studies demonstrated that\nnephron number varies widely (from 200,000 to 2 million nephrons per kidney) in humans. Infants\nwith IUGR manifest reduced nephron endowment when compared to infants who have appropriate\ngrowth parameters for gestational age. Moreover, a linear association exists between the number of\nglomeruli and birth weight in full-term neonates; neonates below the 10th percentile for birth weight\nhad 30% fewer glomeruli than the neonates above the 10th percentile for birth weight. In\nexperimental animal models, a low nephron endowment occurs in IUGR because of twinning,\nmaternal calories and protein undernutrition, uterine artery ligation, and placental embolization.\nThe pathogenesis of impaired nephrogenesis secondary to IUGR is multifactorial. IUGR activates\napoptosis as evidenced by increased p53 phosphorylation, a modification that enhances p53 protein\nstability. p53 is a transcription factor that induces cell apoptosis via binding and activating the\npromoters of proapoptosis genes in the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Interestingly,\nIUGR-induced apoptosis is observed in the stromal mesenchyme and papilla, suggesting that\ngestational programming does not affect the regional position of apoptosis but rather enhances the\n\nphysiologic rate of apoptosis in the developing kidney. IUGR also impairs ureteric bud branching via\nreduction in glial-derived neurotrophic factor and c-Ret expression; this, in turn, impedes nephron\ninduction in the metanephric mesenchyme. Epigenetic mechanisms that involve histone modifications\nand DNA methylation are also important in mediating the effects of IUGR on nephrogenesis via\nregulating chromatin access to transcription factors. Finally, inhibition and not activation of the renin-\nangiotensin and cyclooxygenase systems have been implicated in IUGR-impaired nephrogenesis.\nPREP Pearls\n Intrauterine growth restriction is associated with impaired nephrogenesis.\n The mechanisms are complex and involve alterations in ureteric bud branching, metanephric mesenchyme\nsurvival, and changes in intrarenal vasoactive systems.\n Epigenetic mechanisms that involve histone modifications and DNA methylation of key developmental renal\nregulators are also involved.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the effects of intrauterine growth retardation on nephrogenesis\nSuggested Readings\n Baserga M, Hale, MA, Wang ZM, Yu X, et al.

The\nexpression of ROMK is low to undetectable in the developing distal nephron and increases during\ndevelopment.\n The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is highly active during early development. This high level of\nactivity is mainly caused by the enhanced transcription of the renin gene, which is expressed along the\nentire length of the afferent arterioles. As maturation proceeds, renin-expressing cells become more\nrestricted to the classical vascular pole of the glomerulus. Accordingly, plasma renin\nactivity/concentration, plasma angiotensin I and II concentrations, and aldosterone concentrations are\n10- to 20-fold higher in the neonate than in the older child. Aldosterone synthesis in the adrenal gland\nzona glomerulosa is stimulated by elevated serum potassium concentrations and angiotensin II levels.\n Plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone levels are not rate-limiting factors in neonatal potassium\nsecretion under baseline conditions. The presence of elevated aldosterone levels in the face of\nelevated serum potassium levels in the neonate suggests a state of relative aldosterone resistance, the\nmechanism of which remains unknown.\n However, in the presence of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, such as during\nrenin/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockade, potassium secretion\nbecomes even more limited due to inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis or action.\n Studies of rodents and rabbits and clearance studies in human neonates have revealed that potassium\nsecretion in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron undergoes morphological and functional changes\nduring postnatal maturation. These changes result in developmental induction of luminal ROMK\nchannels (choice B).

    "explanation": "B. donor exchange pairs are kept anonymous throughout the pretransplant process\nMost kidney transplant programs currently limit kidney transplantation to ABO-compatibleor negative\nimmunological crossmatch donor-recipient pairs. The few programs that have performed ABO-\nincompatible or positive crossmatch transplants must address the higher risk of acute rejection (which\ncan occur earlier and be more severe) and the complications of more intense immunosuppression or\ndesensitization. Unfortunately, approximately 1 of 3 potential living organ donors are ABO\nincompatible with their intended recipient. Until recently, this incompatibility precluded living kidney\ntransplants from that donor to that recipient. Deceased donation remains a possibility, but the number\nof organs available (approximately 20,000 each year in the United States) is greatly exceeded by the\nnumber of candidates awaiting a kidney transplant (> 100,000 currently) and is an inferior choice to a\nliving donor kidney.\nHowever, this living donor incompatibility problem can be overcome through a creative solution,\npaired or chain kidney donation. Eligible and willing, but ABO-incompatible, living kidney donors can\ndonate a kidney to someone else with whom they are ABO compatible. In a paired exchange, the\nother recipient’s prospective donor, also ABO incompatible to their primary intended recipient, can\ndonate their kidney to the first pair’s recipient (see Figure).\nFigure: Aull MJ, Kapur S. Kidney paired donation and its potential impact on transplantation. Surg Clin North Am,\n2013; 93: 1407-1421.\n\nIn a donor chain, donor 1 could donate to recipient 2 while donor 2 could donate to recipient 3, and so\non, creating long chains, which can eventually loop around to provide a kidney to recipient 1.\nSuch donor exchanges were first proposed by Felix Rapaport in 1986. Algorithms to facilitate such\nexchanges and long chains were developed by economists Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley, for which\nthey received the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics. These algorithms can be used to optimize the\nmatch between different agents, which could range from matching student applicants with schools to\nmatching organ donors with patients needing a kidney transplant. Such donor exchange kidney\ntransplants were first performed in South Korea and are now performed in many countries.\nIn the United States, the National Organ Transplantation Act of 1984 was amended in 2007 to clarify\nthat a kidney exchange was legal and not an item being transferred for some value to the donor.\nDonor kidney exchanges via the above algorithms are being used by several different kidney chain\nregistries in the United States. Exchange kidneys accounted for nearly 10% of living kidney\ntransplants in the United States in 2011. The outcomes with donor exchange kidneys are equivalent\nto the outcomes with traditional living kidney transplantation.\nThe advantage of a donor exchange registry is to make a living kidney donation possible, without the\nneed for toxic desensitization. The greater genetic diversity afforded by a donor exchange network\nallows for blood group and crossmatch compatible kidneys to be found beyond the recipient’s\nimmediate family and social network. The number of kidneys available for donation therefore also\nincreases.\nDonor chains do not have to involve relatives of the candidates (directed donation). An altruistic\nunrelated donor can be part of the chain (nondirected donation). In fact, often such chains are\ninitiated by a nondirected altruistic living donor, so a recipient does not necessarily need to have a\nliving donor pair to be listed in an exchange, although having a living donor certainly helps. Also, the\nvarious exchange transplants do not have to be performed simultaneously. For a single-set paired\nexchange, simultaneous transplant is feasible. For long chains, simultaneous transplant is difficult,\nand the current practice is to perform them as close together in time as possible.\nTo prevent distress in case one of the kidney transplants does not do as well as the others, the\ncurrent practice is to keep the different donor-recipient pairs anonymous from each other through the\npretransplant and immediate peritransplant process. In the posttransplant period, provided all parties\nhave given consent, the different donor and recipient pairs may contact each other.\nOf the various options in the vignette, A, C, and D are all options that have exceptions in practice, but\nare worded to preclude ANY exceptions, therefore incorrect. Option B (donor exchange pairs are kept\nanonymous throughout the pretransplant process), the preferred response, is not worded to insist on\nanonymity, but that is the general current practice.\nPREP Pearls\n Donor exchange protocols have allowed ABO-incompatible donors to donate a kidney to another recipient and\nthe primary intended recipient could receive a kidney in either paired exchange or as part of a chain.\n These exchange protocols do not require a living donor nor do they have to be simultaneous.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the indications and benefits of enrolling in donor exchange and chain protocols\n\nSuggested Readings\n Aull MJ, Kapur S.

    "explanation": "D. voiding cystourethrography\nThe child in this vignette has acute kidney injury and hypertensive urgency secondary to obstructive\nuropathy. Obstruction relief is a priority to preserve renal function and augment blood pressure–\nlowering efforts. Normal bladder capacity for a child of this age is approximately 100 mL. With 500 mL\nurine return after placement of a Foley catheter, you have confirmed that there is at least an\nobstruction distal to the bladder. The most common etiology of this type of obstruction in a male child\nis posterior urethral valve (PUV). Other etiologies include urethral atresia or stricture or bladder neck\nabnormalities.\nThe child in this vignette has a lower urinary tract obstruction as evidenced by the renal and bladder\nultrasonography findings and the clinical response to Foley catheter insertion. Although PUV is a\nlikely cause, voiding cystourethrography should be performed prior to surgery to confirm the\ndiagnosis of PUV and assess for vesicoureteral reflux. After PUV is confirmed, cystoscopy with valve\nablation may be pursued. Incontinent stoma creation is occasionally used in cases where continuous\nbladder emptying is required in an infant who is ordinarily incontinent. However, the bladder\nthickness, capacity, and distensibility would need to be assessed prior to this procedure. In addition,\nthe upper tract should be assessed to determine if a more proximal diversion is warranted because of\nadditional proximal functional or structural obstruction. Radioisotope renography with MAG3\n(mercaptoacetyltriglycine) is helpful in determining the presence of ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) and\nureterovesicular junction (UVJ) obstruction, in addition to providing information about differential\nkidney function. However, the child in this vignette clearly has a distal obstruction at the level of the\nbladder, so this test would not be the best test to perform next. Computed tomography is not\nindicated, because the combination of kidney ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrography is\nmost likely to establish the diagnosis, allowing for rapid transit to cystoscopy and surgical correction.\nObstructive uropathy can be partial or complete. It can also be acute or chronic and can occur at any\nlocation along the urinary tract. Most cases of obstructive uropathy present in infancy because\nabnormalities are identified by prenatal ultrasonography. Common causes (in descending anatomic\norder) include UPJ obstruction, UVJ obstruction, and posterior urethral valve.\nUreteropelvic junction obstruction is the most common cause of congenital urinary tract obstruction\nand is typically diagnosed prenatally. It occurs more often on the left side and is twice as common in\nboys than in girls. Although it is usually unilateral, bilateral UPJ obstruction occurs in 10% to 40% of\ncases.\nWith UPJ obstruction, a narrowing of the proximal ureter at the point where the ureter meets the renal\npelvis blocks urine flow from the renal pelvis into the ureter. This obstruction can be due to intrinsic or\nextrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors, such as a dysfunctional or adynamic ureteral segment, are much\nmore common in the pediatric age group. Rarely, polyps or stones can cause obstruction via a valve-\nlike process. Extrinsic causes, which include aberrant/crossing vessels, kinks, bands, and adhesions,\noften lead to intermittent UPJ obstruction.\nA distal ureter that is adynamic is usually the cause of UVJ obstruction. This poorly functioning\nureteral segment interrupts the functional continuity of the rest of the ureter, leading to primary\nmegaureter. Primary megaureter is in contrast to secondary megaureter, which occurs with distal\nobstructive processes such as ureteroceles, PUV, and urethral atresia, and in contrast to refluxing\nmegaureter, which occurs with vesicoureteral reflux.\nPosterior urethral valve results in bladder outlet obstruction and is the most common cause of lower\nurinary tract obstruction in male infants. The obstruction is caused by an abnormal valve-like\nmembrane that originates from the verumontanum in the posterior urethra. The embryologic\n\ncounterpart of this membrane in females is the hymen. Posterior urethral valves are associated with\nsmall-capacity, thickened, poorly compliant bladders that contribute to poor urinary drainage even\nafter the obstruction is relieved.\nBecause these forms of congenital urinary tract obstruction often present prenatally and are managed\nsoon after birth, many infants are asymptomatic. However, more severe forms of obstructive uropathy\nsuch as PUV can be associated with severe dilatation of the urinary tract, oligohydramnios, and\npulmonary hypoplasia. Generally speaking, the greater the degree of hydronephrosis noted on\nprenatal ultrasonography, the greater the likelihood of a more significant urologic abnormality.\nThe cornerstone of obstructive uropathy management is close monitoring and screening for renal\nsequelae. As described below, some obstructions resolve spontaneously and others require surgical\ncorrection.\nInfants with UPJ obstruction who are diagnosed prenatally are often asymptomatic, but children who\nare diagnosed later in life may develop abrupt-onset flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and dehydration.\nThese children may report that certain positions (curling up on the floor, leaning over a piece of\nfurniture) alleviate the symptoms and that pain will later subside after several hours with no fluid\nintake. Diagnosis in these children can be challenging, often requiring an imaging study during the\npainful episode. Although UPJ obstruction can self-resolve with maturation, self-resolution is less\nlikely with greater degrees of hydronephrosis. The gold standard management approach is surgical\ncorrection via dismembered pyeloplasty after an initial period of observation and monitoring. Urinary\ntract infection is not common with UPJ obstruction. If a urinary tract infection is present, one should\nlook for comorbid vesicoureteral reflux or bladder abnormalities.\nIn contrast to UPJ obstruction, UVJ obstruction rarely presents with pain and is often associated with\nurinary tract infection. During an infectious episode, the degree of ureteral dilatation may be more\npronounced because of the effect of bacterial toxins on the ureteral smooth muscle. Although UVJ\nobstruction can self-resolve, there are no signs or symptoms that predict resolution. If the UVJ\nobstruction does not resolve, ureteral reimplantation with an antireflux approach may be required,\nparticularly in children who experience recurrent urinary tract infections.\nAs with the other forms of obstructive uropathy, PUV often presents prenatally but can also present in\nlater childhood. A prenatal diagnosis may be made when ultrasonography reveals a small bladder,\nbilateral hydroureteronephrosis, and oligohydramnios. Later presentation may include a history of\nurinary incontinence, weak urinary stream, or urinary tract infection, or it may be more significant with\nurosepsis and renal failure. Once the diagnosis is established with renal ultrasonography and voiding\ncystourethrography that show a dilated posterior urethra, the child should undergo bladder\ndecompression and endoscopic valve ablation. The bladders in children with PUV are often quite\nsmall, stiff, and poorly compliant. They are often under very high pressure that is exacerbated by the\nimpaired concentrating ability of the kidneys, which produces a large urinary volume. This\ncombination of a large urinary volume and high pressure bladder results in high pressures transmitted\nto the kidneys and worsening renal function. Therefore, children with PUV require very close follow-\nup with ultrasonography and laboratory assessments. Many children with PUV will have poor bladder\nfunction that requires additional surgeries to enhance urinary drainage. Potential interventions include\nmore proximal urinary diversion (vesicostomy, ureterostomy, pyelostomy), bladder augmentation, and\nureteral tapering with reimplantation. Regular bladder emptying is essential and often requires clean\nintermittent catheterization during the day and Foley catheter drainage overnight. In children who are\nsensate, catheterization may prove difficult. In these cases, creation of a continent catheterizable\nstoma may be necessary.\n\nIn all forms of obstructive uropathy, close monitoring before and after surgery is essential to preserve\nrenal function. Monitoring consists of blood pressure measurement to screen for hypertension,\nelectrolyte and renal function assessment to screen for chronic kidney disease progression, urine\nstudies to screen for proteinuria, and imaging studies of the kidneys and bladder to screen for new or\nworsening obstruction or reflux. Ideally, the imaging should consist of ultrasonography performed\nwhen the bladder is both full and empty to provide additional functional information. The interval\nbetween follow-up imaging studies is dependent on the initial management approach (watchful\nwaiting vs decompression) and clinical response (structural and functional). Regardless of the\napproach, long-term follow-up is critical to preserve and protect renal function as the child matures\nand reaches adulthood.\nFamilies should be counseled on the avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, including nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs. They should be provided anticipatory guidance regarding early identification and\ntreatment of urinary tract infections. Due to the impaired renal concentrating ability of most children\nwith obstructive uropathy, families should also be counseled on providing children free access to\nwater and ensuring that they remain hydrated. Constipation, which can lead to further difficulties with\nbladder emptying, is a frequent comorbid finding in these children. Close monitoring of stool habits\nand stool burden is also required, and early treatment of constipation should be encouraged.\nPREP Pearls\n Some forms of obstructive uropathy (ureteropelvic junction obstruction, ureterovesicular junction obstruction)\ncan self-resolve, but others (posterior urethral valve) require immediate intervention and ultimate surgical\ncorrection.\n Close long-term follow-up to screen for hypertension, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, and new or worsening\nobstruction is essential for patients with obstructive uropathy.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the management options and follow-up for patients with urethral valves, ureterovesicular junction\nobstruction, and ureteropelvic junction obstruction\nSuggested Readings\n Chevalier RL, Peters CA.

About a\nquarter of individuals with Joubert syndrome will have nephronophthisis. Other organs that may be\ninvolved include the eyes (coloboma, retinal dystrophy), liver (fibrosis), and skeleton (polydactyly).\nJoubert syndrome has autosomal recessive inheritance, and mutations in at least 20 genes have\nbeen implicated.\nMany of the Joubert syndrome–related genes are also causative of nephronophthisis-related\nciliopathy (NEPHRC), for which mutations in at least 30 genes have been implicated. Renal disease\nin NEPHRC involves progressive tubular atrophy, tubule basement membrane thinning, interstitial\ninflammation, and fibrosis. On ultrasonography, the kidneys may show increased echogenicity that\nprogresses to small hyperechoic kidneys with poor corticomedullary differentiation.

    "explanation": "C. norepinephrine\nThe patient described in the vignette fulfills the criteria for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Of the\nchoices provided for treatment options, diuretics, which may be used for the treatment of portal\nhypertension, would worsen circulating volume. Dopamine, with its partial vasodilatory properties,\ncould worsen the acute kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, these agents are not the appropriate.\nNorepinephrine has been used in the United States for splanchnic vasoconstriction and raising blood\npressure in HRS.\nHepatorenal syndrome describes functional renal failure in patients with chronic liver disease;\nhowever, renal histologic findings would appear unchanged, and tubular function appears intact.\nReportedly, patients with HRS recover kidney function after liver transplantation, and their kidneys\nhave even been used as renal allografts for kidney transplantation.\nThe pathophysiology is secondary to splanchnic vasodilatation because of portal hypertension, which\nin turn leads to decreased effective circulatory volume, and subsequent decreased glomerular\nfiltration rate. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system worsens this cycle and also\nleads to sodium retention. Abnormal renal autoregulation and cirrhotic cardiomyopathy perpetuate\nthis vicious cycle (Figure).\nFigure: The vasodilatation hypothesis of hepatorenal Syndrome.\nReprinted with permission from Adebayo D, Morabito V, Davenport A, Jalan R. Renal dysfunction in cirrhosis is not\njust a vasomotor nephropathy. Kidney Int. 2015;87:509–515.\n\nTwo types of HRS are recognized. Type 1 has an acute onset of renal failure (within 2 weeks),\nwhereas type 2 HRS has a more gradual decline in renal function.\nThe original criteria for diagnosis of HRS included minor criteria, such as urine volume less than 500\nmL/d, urine sodium less than 10 mEq/L (10 mmol/L), urine osmolality greater than plasma osmolality,\nand a serum sodium concentration less than 130 mEq/L (130 mmol/L). The major criteria initially\nincluded a measured 24-hour creatinine clearance of less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 (0.67 mL/s/m2).\nOver time, the creatinine clearance criteria was removed and the urine volume and sodium level\ncriteria were also removed due to nonspecificity. However, a urine sodium level less than 10 mEq/L\n(10 mmol/L) helps us differentiate HRS from acute tubular necrosis and other organic causes.\nThere are problems with these criteria for the pediatric nephrologist, the first being not pediatric\nfriendly because it relies on an absolute creatinine concentration. Secondly, serum creatinine is not a\ngood marker of renal function because patients with cirrhosis are malnourished and have increased\ncreatinine secretion as well.\nPotential refinements to this criteria are to include Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes\ncriteria in diagnosing AKI and the use of newer biomarkers, such as cystatin C and neutrophil\ngelatinase-associated lipocalin. Studies are underway to validate these measures.\nPrevention strategies focus on avoidance of renal injury in patients with cirrhosis are proposed in\n‘World J Nephrol. 2015;4(5):511-520 to include:\n Minimize exposure to iodinated contrast agents\n Prescribe intravenous albumin for volemic filling after large volume paracentesis\n Suspend or limit diuretic therapy\n Prescribe antibiotics to prophylactically prevent infections reducing intestinal bacterial translocation\n Identify and treat adrenal insufficiency\n Adjust drug dosages according to renal function\n Avoid drugs that reduce renal perfusion or nephrotoxic substances\nWhen treating HRS, medical therapy primarily targets the causes by the principal pathogenetic\nmechanism. The treatment approach cause splanchnic vasoconstriction, which reduces portal\nhypertension. This in turn increases the circulating volume, which improves renal perfusion. The\nvasoconstrictor agents that are used are terlipressin, norepinephrine, and midodrine.\nThe treatment of choice for HRS is intravenous terlipressin with albumin. In addition to expanding\nthe the circulating volume; albumin binds to bile acids, bilirubin, and endotoxins produced in liver\ndysfunction, thereby exerting metabolic and some immune effects as well. This combination has a\nfavorable outcome in 40% to 60% of patients. Once the serum creatinine level is below 1.5 mg/dL\n(133 μmol/L), the treatment is stopped in adults. The recovery time is between 1 and 2 weeks, and\nafter 2 weeks, if there is no improvement, treatment should be stopped. Recurrence is seen in almost\n50% of patients. However, terlipressin is not available in the United States and Canada.\nNorepinephrine, which is an ɑ-adrenergic agent, has also been used in HRS. The aim of treatment is\nto increase the mean arterial pressure by 10 mm Hg, thereby increasing urine output. Another\nalternative to norepinephrine is midodrine, another ?-adrenergic agent. It is a prodrug metabolized to\nits active metabolite desglymidodrine by the liver. Midodrine is used in combination with octreotide,\nwhich is a somatostatin analog and splanchnic vasodilator; this combination has a 50% chance of\n\nreversing HRS. Octreotide alone has no effect on kidney function in HRS. Both norepinephrine and\nthe midodrine-octreotide combination have been used in the United States for HRS.\nSome other modalities that are tried in HRS and outlined in ‘World J Nephrol. 2015;4(5):511-520’ are\nas follows:\n Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt - The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt\nincreases venous return to the right side of the heart and increases the effective blood volume, thereby\nimproving renal function in HRS.\n Renal Replacement Therapy - Indications for renal replacement therapy (RRT) are no different than\nany other cause of AKI. RRT is used as a bridging therapy for HRS until liver transplantation; however,\nthere is no evidence of improvement of survival of patients awaiting liver transplantation.\n Extracorporeal Artificial Liver Support Therapy - Although RRT improves removal of water soluble\ntoxins, such as ammonia, most toxins that accumulate in liver failure are albumin bound and are not\nremoved by conventional RRT. Liver support therapies are designed to remove both albumin-bound\nand water-soluble toxins and have been used as bridging therapies for patients awaiting liver\ntransplantation.\n Liver Transplantation - Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for HRS. However, recovery of\nrenal function is not universal. In fact, a quarter of patients did not recover renal function in a small\nseries of 28 patients with HRS who underwent liver transplantation. Even with renal recovery, although\nsodium excretion and renal function normalize within a month, renovascular resistance may take longer\nto recover (as much as a year).\nAll of these treatment recommendations are based mainly on adult experience.\nPREP Pearls\n Hepatorenal syndrome is traditionally ascribed to functional acute kidney injury in patients with chronic liver\ndisease associated with no significant morphologic changes in renal histologic features and with largely\npreserved tubular function.\n The ideal treatment is to improve liver function by causing splanchnic vasoconstriction, which reduces portal\nhypertension and thereby increases circulating volume, which in turn causes renal vasodilation.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand ways of preventing and treating hepatorenal syndrome\nSuggested Readings\n Adebayo D, Morabito V, Davenport A, Jalan R.

    "explanation": "C. positive anti-streptococcal serologies\nThis 7-year-old boy with acute kidney injury (AKI) has findings suggestive of an acute\nglomerulonephritis. Given the recent respiratory illness and high prevalence of streptococcal infection\nin school-aged children, an infection-associated glomerulonephritis, such as post-streptococcal\nglomerulonephritis (PSGN), is most likely. With PSGN, complement 3 levels would be expected to be\nlow. Both hematuria and pyuria are common with PSGN, and the pyuria is generally a predominance\nof neutrophils rather than eosinophils. Eosinophils might be expected in medication-induced\ntubulointerstitial nephritis; however, the boy in this vignette has not taken medications that cause\ntubulointerstitial nephritis. His recent infection could be consistent with an infectious trigger for\ntubulointerstitial nephritis; however, this condition is much less common than PSGN. Schistocytes in\nthe blood might be expected with a thrombotic microangiopathy. These microangiopathies, in\nparticular hemolytic uremic syndrome, can lead to AKI; however, in this case, thrombocytopenia\nwould also be expected.\nThe etiologies of AKI include decreased circulatory volume and impaired renal perfusion, intrinsic\ninjury to the kidney, or obstruction of outflow from the kidney. The intrinsic causes of AKI include\nglomerular etiologies and tubulointerstitial etiologies, including tubulointerstitial nephritis. Another\ncommon tubulointerstitial cause of AKI is acute tubular necrosis from hypoxic kidney injury or\nnephrotoxic kidney injury. Glomerular etiologies for AKI are now less common than tubulointerstitial\ncauses; however, they remain important to consider in the differential diagnosis. Any\nglomerulonephritis, if sufficiently severe in presentation and pathology, may present with AKI. Certain\nglomerular disorders, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, and pulmonary renal syndromes, such as\nantineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitides, typically present severely and are\ncommonly associated with AKI. But, common glomerular disorders, such as PSGN and IgA\nnephropathy, can have severe presentations with AKI and require renal replacement therapy.\nPREP Pearls\n Acute kidney injury may be caused by decreased circulatory volume and impaired renal perfusion, intrinsic\ninjury to the kidney, or obstruction of outflow from the kidney.\n Intrinsic causes of kidney injury include glomerular etiologies and tubulointerstitial etiologies.\n Any glomerulonephritis, if sufficiently severe in presentation and pathology, may present with acute kidney\ninjury, including conditions such as postinfectious glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy that typically have\nless severe presentations.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Recognize that certain primary kidney disorders (such as hemolytic-uremic syndrome, glomerular disorders,\nand tubulointerstitial nephritis) may present with acute kidney injury\nSuggested Readings\n Selewski DT, Symons JM.

    "explanation": "D. isolated renal glucosuria\nThe girl in this vignette has asymptomatic isolated glucosuria in the absence of proteinuria,\nphosphaturia, acidosis, or clinical signs of rickets. She also has normal growth and development.\nMost importantly, she has normoglycemia. Accordingly, the most likely cause of glucosuria in this\npatient is isolated renal glucosuria, also known as hereditary glucosuria or familial renal glucosuria.\nRenal glucose reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule and is achieved by the concerted actions of\nluminal and basolateral transporters. The S2 segment of the proximal convoluted tubule expresses a\nluminal sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT2), which is a low-affinity high-capacity glucose\ntransporter encoded by SLC5A2. Following transport by SGLT2, glucose is transported out of the cell\nto the peritubular capillaries via the sodium-independent transporter GLUT2, which is encoded\nby SLC2A2. The concerted actions of SGLT2 and GLUT2 mediate the bulk of glucose absorption in\nthe early proximal tubule. The late or straight S3 segment of the proximal tubule expresses a luminal\nhigh-affinity, low-capacity sodium-glucose transporter called SGLT1, which is encoded by SLC5A1,\nand a basolateral sodium-independent transporter GLUT1, which is encoded by SLC2A1. These 2\ntransporters mediate absorption of the filtered glucose that escaped reabsorption in the early proximal\ntubule. SGLT1 has affinity for both glucose and galactose.\nUnder normal conditions, the urine is glucose-free. Physiologic glucosuria occurs in premature\ninfants. Tubular reabsorption of glucose matures by 30 weeks of gestation. Glucosuria occasionally\noccurs in patients with heavy proteinuria and damage to the early proximal tubule, such as patients\nwith early focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. Glucosuria, generalized aminoaciduria,\nphosphaturia, renal tubular acidosis, and rickets occur in patients with renal Fanconi syndrome\ncaused by disorders such as cystinosis, Fanconi-Bickel syndrome, toxic nephropathies, and\ntyrosinemia. Of course, glucosuria is a cardinal sign of hyperglycemia when filtered glucose exceeds\nthe tubular maximum for glucose of the proximal tubule.\nThe presence of isolated glucosuria in the absence of fasting hyperglycemia in an otherwise healthy\nchild should raise suspicion for familial renal glucosuria (OMIM [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]\nphenotype #233100), an autosomal recessive disorder of renal glucose reabsorption. Familial renal\nglucosuria is caused by mutations in SLC5A2, which encodes SGLT2. Patients with familial renal\nglucosuria are typically asymptomatic, except in some cases during pregnancy or extreme starvation.\nFamilial renal glucosuria is not associated with intestinal malabsorption of glucose, hence the lack of\nsignificant gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients with mutations in SLC2A2, which encodes GLUT2,\nmanifest Fanconi-Bickel syndrome, which is characterised by aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, and\nrickets, in addition to glucosuria. Patients typically also have hepatosplenomegaly. Presumably,\naccumulation of excess glucose in the cell harms the proximal tubular cell, causing apoptosis and a\ngeneralized proximal tubulopathy. Mutations in SLC5A1, which encodes SGLT1, cause glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption in the kidney and intestine. This autosomal recessive disorder may be fatal,\ncausing severe neonatal diarrhea, if not recognized early and treated by elimination of glucose and\ngalactose from the diet.\nThe patient in this vignette does not have a generalized tubulopathy caused by Fanconi-Bickel\nsyndrome, hyperglycemia caused by diabetes mellitus, or glucose-galactose malabsorption.\nPREP Pearls\n Isolated renal glucosuria is generally a benign disorder of renal glucose transport caused by mutations in the\nluminal sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2, which is expressed in the S2 segment of the early proximal\ntubule.\n\n Mutations in the basolateral glucose transporter 2 cause Fanconi-Bickel syndrome, a generalized proximal\ntubulopathy and glucosuria.\n Hereditary renal glucosuria (mutations in sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2) should be distinguished\nfrom glucose-galactose malabsorption (mutations in sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1), given the\nsignificantly different clinical courses and management of these 2 disorders.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the differential diagnosis of glucosuria\nSuggested Readings\n Santer R, Calado J.

The MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) scan findings of left-sided radiotracer\nretention with delayed excretion suggest an obstruction and not a physiologic or nonobstructive cause\nof hydronephrosis. Voiding cystourethrography in the clinical setting of UPJ obstruction should not\ndemonstrate bladder or urethral abnormalities or reflux.\nUreteropelvic junction obstructions are the second leading pathologic cause of antenatal\nhydronephrosis; the most common cause is vesicoureteral reflux. Ureteropelvic junction obstructions\nare relatively common and occur in 1 per 1,000 to 2,000 newborns. Pathophysiological causes can be\ncategorized as extramural, mural, or intramural in regards to the site of the ureteral abnormality\nleading to obstruction. The most common cause of UPJ obstruction in the newborn is mural causes.\nKajbafzadeh et al assessed histologic components of the UPJ following pyeloplasty in 23 patients\nwith obstruction as compared to 25 autopsies from patients without UPJ obstruction. They found that\nsmooth muscle cell apoptosis was increased in the obstructed segment of the ureter as compared to\nnonobstructed segments within the same patients and the autopsy controls. They also found a higher\namount of collagen deposition and lower number of nerve endings at the site of obstruction. These\nhistologic findings appear to result in the adynamic segment of ureter and subsequent obstruction.\nLess commonly, extramural impingement of the ureter by surrounding structures can also cause UPJ\nobstruction. Aberrant vessels or adhesions can lead to intermittent extrinsic compression of the ureter\nbut are more rare than mural abnormalities. Intramural obstructions such as fibroepithelial outgrowths\ncan also cause UPJ obstruction by occluding the lumen of the ureter. However, these lesions are a\nvery rare cause of UPJ obstruction in newborns. Finally, while an ectopic ureteric bud can lead to\nabnormal interaction with the metanephric mesenchyme and a theoretically abnormal UPJ, response\nchoice C suggests that an ectopic insertion distally would manifest itself more as a ureterovesical\njunction obstruction rather than a proximal ureter obstruction.\nPREP Pearls\n Ureteropelvic junction obstruction is most commonly associated with abnormal collections of collagen and\nsmooth muscle fibers within the ureter and an adynamic segment of the ureter.\n External compression and intraluminal obstructions are rare causes of ureteropelvic junction obstruction.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know how to diagnose and evaluate obstructive lesions at the ureterovesicular junction and the ureteropelvic\njunction\n Know how to diagnose and evaluate obstructive lesions at the ureterovesicular junction and the ureteropelvic\njunction\nSuggested Readings\n Kajbafzadeh AM, Payabvash S, Salmasi AH, Monajemzadeh M, Tavangar SM.

    "explanation": "A. high sodium and high potassium diet\nThe teenager in this vignette most likely has Gitelman syndrome, which is caused by autosomal\nrecessive loss-of-function of the sodium-chloride cotransporter expressed on the apical membranes\nof distal convoluted tubular cells. This loss of function leads to inappropriate loss of sodium chloride in\nthe urine and resulting hypovolemia. The hypovolemia stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone\nsystem, enhancing excretion of K+ and H+ in the cortical collecting duct, leading to hypokalemia and\nmetabolic alkalosis. Loss of function of the sodium-chloride cotransporter also leads to impaired\nmagnesium reabsorption by the distal convoluted tubule and resulting hypomagnesemia. Because of\nthe activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and compensatory mechanisms to enhance\nsodium reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle,\ncalcium reabsorption is also stimulated through paracellular mechanisms. Therefore, urine calcium\nlevels are normal or even somewhat low, which helps to distinguish Gitelman Syndrome from Bartter\nsyndrome.\nThe teenager in this vignette displays all of the diagnostic features of Gitelman syndrome, including\nhypovolemia (worse during vigorous activity or dehydrating illness), hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis,\nhypomagnesemia, and normal urine calcium levels. Gitelman syndrome typically presents in school-\naged children, teenagers, or young adults, in contrast to Bartter syndrome, which often presents in\nthe neonatal period. This difference is because the loop of Henle, the site of the dysfunction in Bartter\nsyndrome, is responsible for reabsorbing a much greater sodium/volume load as compared to the\ndistal convoluted tubule. Presenting symptoms of Gitelman syndrome are hypovolemia, hypokalemia,\nand/or hypomagnesemia (eg, weakness, muscle cramps), which are escalated during vigorous\nactivity or dehydrating illness. Complications are generally directly related to fluid and electrolyte\nabnormalities. Notably, glomerular filtration rate and other renal functional parameters are generally\nmaintained in Gitelman syndrome, whereas the hypercalciuria in Bartter syndrome can lead to\nnephrocalcinosis, tubulointerstitial damage, and eventual progressive impairment in glomerular\nfiltration rate.\nThe first step in the treatment of Gitelman syndrome is to replace the urinary losses of sodium\nchloride and potassium with a high sodium, high potassium diet. Most patients naturally crave this\ndiet and may have already adopted it prior to diagnosis. A diet high in magnesium is also indicated.\nPotassium and magnesium supplements are often required in addition to dietary management.\nLisinopril or spironolactone can be considered to manage the often very significant hypokalemia\nassociated with Gitelman syndrome. However, these medications block important compensatory\nmechanisms for hypovolemia, so they should not be first-line therapies for Gitelman syndrome;\nrather, they should only be used for severe, refractory, symptomatic hypokalemia. When these\nmedications are started, the patient requires close monitoring for signs and symptoms of worsening\nhypovolemia. Ibuprofen can also be a helpful therapy, mitigating the amount of sodium chloride\nwasting that occurs by constricting the afferent arteriole of the glomerulus. This is a mainstay of\ntreatment for Bartter syndrome, but is not always necessary in Gitelman syndrome; so, it is not\nconsidered a first-line therapy. Chronic ibuprofen use can result in gastric irritation and worsening\nkidney function.\nPREP Pearls\n Gitelman syndrome, which is caused by loss of function of the sodium-chloride cotransporter, presents with\nhypovolemia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypomagnesemia.\n Initial treatment should include a diet high in sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Most patients also require\npotassium and magnesium supplementation.\n\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists may also be used to treat hypokalemia\nbut carry risks of worsening hypovolemia; therefore, patient monitoring is needed if these medications are\nstarted.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the clinical and laboratory features of Gitelman syndrome\n Know the treatment and the complications of treatment for Gitelman syndrome\nSuggested Readings\n Seyberth HW.

There are three important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics: the\ndevelopment of new algorithms and statistics with which to assess relationships among members of\nlarge data sets; the analysis and interpretation of various types of data including nucleotide and\namino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures; and the development and\nimplementation of tools that enable efficient access and management of different types of information.\nBioinformatics includes all of the “omics,” such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics (Figure).\nFigure.

Deciphering\nthe complex: methodological overview of statistical models to derive OMICS-based biomarkers. Environ Mol\nMutagen. 2013;54(7):542-557.\nThe flood of data from biology, mainly in the form of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, has placed a\nheavy demand on computers and computational scientists, while also demanding a transformation of\nthe basic ethos of biological sciences. These activities have generated terabytes of data that are\nbeing analyzed with computer, statistical, and machine learning techniques.\nBioinformatics represents the convergence of genomics, biotechnology, and information technology\nand encompasses analysis and interpretation of data, modeling of biological phenomena, and\ndevelopment of algorithms and statistics. Bioinformatics has typically been used to describe the\nanalytics applied to basic research (T1 informatics) or translational studies (T2 informatics). In\ncontrast, clinical informatics is more specific to improving health care and encompasses implementing\nand evaluating guidelines (T3 informatics) as well as using data from clinical practice epidemiology\nand population health to inform research (T4 informatics). In each case, the challenges are similar.\n\nTo address the large data problem, several organizations have created large, open access,\nmultinational biological databases. For example, a genome biodatabase can comprise sequence data\nfrom many genome sequencing projects worldwide.Most of these tools are available over the Internet.\nAs the databases continue to grow, mining them offers newer challenges.\nThe field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis\nand interpretation of various types of data, which include nucleotide and amino acid sequences,\nprotein domains, and protein structures. Therefore, bioinformatics also includes the development and\nimplementation of computer programs that enable efficient access to, use, and management of\nvarious types of information. It also includes the development of algorithms and statistical measures\nthat assess relationships among members of large data sets.\nThe statistical testing of mega data sets has imposed serious methodological challenges. One of the\nchallenges is the “small n, large p” problem, wherein a relatively small number of observations “n” (in\nthis vignette, n = 100) was greatly exceeded by the number of measurements “p” or variables (in this\nvignette, several thousands or more). Theoretically, every measurement or variable could be tested\nfor each observation, but then by chance alone, some associations might be deemed significant. Two\nstrategies are used to address this problem. First, the measurements can be reduced to smaller\ngroups by building upon the biological correlation within the data, eg, viruses that cluster together\nphylogenetically can be lumped into one group by evolutionary algorithms. Second, multiple statistical\ncorrection strategies have to be used. Multiple comparisons cannot overcome sampling error; in fact\na lower p-value is needed to achieve significance. The Table details some of the most common\nmethods for statistical analyses of mega datasets.\nTable.

    "explanation": "D. work on weight loss to achieve a normal body mass index\nAll children who are diagnosed with primary or secondary hypertension should be counseled on\ntherapeutic lifestyle changes (Table).\nTable. Recommended Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes.\nLose weight if overweight, with a goal of:\n● Body mass index < 85th percentile if < 20 years of age\n● Body mass index < 25 kg/m2 if ≥ 20 years of age\nAchieve ≥ 1 hour of moderate to vigorous exercise (eg, jogging, baseball) every daya\nEngage in vigorous activity (eg, running, tennis, soccer) on 3 d/wk\nDecrease sedentary activities (television and video games) to < 2 h/d\nInstitute the Cardiovascular Health Integrated Lifestyle diet (CHILD-1 ) and DASH eating plan:\n● Increase intake of fresh vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy\n● Reduced carbohydrate, fat, and processed sugar intake\n● Limit/avoid sugar-sweetened beverages\n● Encourage foods with high dietary fiber content (age + 5 = number of grams per day)\nLimit sodium intake\nStop smoking\nAbbreviation: DASH, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.\naFor children ≥ 5 years of age\nCourtesy of T. Brady\nEach component of these recommended modifications lowers blood pressure, and there is evidence\nfor an amplified response when the modifications are adopted together. If an asymptomatic child with\nprimary hypertension and no target organ damage is unsuccessful in making the recommended\nlifestyle changes or remains hypertensive after 6 to 12 months of therapeutic lifestyle changes, then\nan antihypertensive medication should be prescribed. In contrast, children with secondary\nhypertension, symptomatic hypertension, type 1 or 2 diabetes, or left ventricular hypertrophy should\nbe prescribed an antihypertensive medication at diagnosis while also working on a heart healthy\nlifestyle.\nBody size is a determinant of blood pressure in children. Across all ages, increasing body weight is\nassociated with increasing blood pressure and with hypertension. Weight loss lowers blood pressure\nin children and adults. In adults, a 5% reduction in body weight decreases systolic blood pressure by\n1.8 to 3.8 mm Hg. Although weight loss has not been as extensively studied in children, overweight\nand obese children who lose weight may have a more substantial drop in systolic blood pressure,\nwith studies reporting a decrease ranging from 6 to 16 mm Hg. Because of this beneficial\ncardiovascular effect of weight loss, all children with hypertension should be counseled on the\nimportance of maintaining a normal body mass index. Furthermore, among children with obesity-\nrelated primary hypertension, weight loss should be considered first-line therapy. In this patient\npopulation, weight loss is not only effective, but it addresses the underlying cause, improves\ncomorbidities, and reduces sympathetic nervous system activation that contributes to the\ndevelopment of hypertension in the overweight or obese individual.\nExercise is also effective in reducing blood pressure. Children who engage in moderate to vigorous\nactivity are less likely to have elevated blood pressure and hypertension than children who are less\nactive. The effect of exercise on blood pressure is more pronounced when it is sustained and when it\nis combined with weight loss.\nThe impact of diet quality and sodium reduction on blood pressure is best demonstrated in adults in\nthe Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and DASH-Sodium trials. Independently,\n\nimproving diet quality (increased intake of fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy) and decreasing sodium\nintake each lowers blood pressure among adults. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 6.6 mm Hg\n(95% confidence interval, 4.0 to 9.1 mm Hg) when following a DASH diet with a high sodium intake\n(compared to a usual diet with high sodium intake) and by 8.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 6.6\nto 10.0 mm Hg) when following a low sodium diet in the setting of a usual diet (compared to a low\nsodium usual diet) among adults with hypertension. When implemented together (a DASH diet plus\nsodium reduction), blood pressure is lowered even further; systolic blood pressure was reduced by\n11.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 8.9 to 14.1 mm Hg) when a low sodium, DASH diet was\nfollowed. These adult studies have formed the basis of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the\nCardiovascular Health Integrated Lifestyle Diet (CHILD-1) described in the Table.\nThe guidelines are vague regarding sodium intake, recommending only to “limit sodium intake.” The\nInstitute of Medicine provides recommended sodium intake by age, with the following maximum\nrecommended daily intake:\n 1 to 3 years of age, 1,500 mg\n 4 to 8 years of age, 1,900 mg\n 9 to 13 years of age, 2,200 mg\n 14 to 18 years of age, 2,300 mg\nThe 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that the general population ingest less than\n2,300 mg/d of sodium. Individuals with certain characteristics (age > 50 years; African American race;\nhistory of hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease) should target a daily sodium intake of\nless than 1,500 mg. These guidelines do not provide specific recommended intakes for children. The\nDietary Guidelines for Americans were updated in 2015 and, while not specifically addressing\nchildren, recommended that sodium intake remain less than 2,300 mg/d for the general population or\nbelow age-appropriate upper limits established by the Institute of Medicine.\nSmoking increases cardiovascular disease risk and can lead to blood pressure elevations, particularly\nwithin 30 minutes of smoking. Many individuals begin smoking cigarettes in their teenage years, so\nregular screening for tobacco use and cessation counseling is important in this age group.\nThe patient in this vignette is an asymptomatic adolescent with primary, stage I hypertension. She\nhas no comorbidities or evidence of target organ damage, so the immediate initiation of an\nantihypertensive medication is not warranted. Excess weight may be contributing to her hypertension,\nso weight loss should be a priority in the management approach. In addition, she should be\ncounseled on implementing the other components of a heart healthy lifestyle (Table). These healthy\nbehaviors include an hour of moderate to vigorous activity each day and limiting sodium intake.\nPREP Pearls\n Therapeutic lifestyle change should be prescribed to all children who are diagnosed with hypertension.\n Weight loss should be prescribed to all children with a body mass index greater than the 85th percentile and all\nyoung adults older than 20 years with a body mass index greater than 25 kg/m2 who are also hypertensive.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the contribution of diet, BMI, and exercise to blood pressure control\n\nSuggested Readings\n Appel LJ, Lichtenstein AH, Callahan EA, Sinaiko A, Van Horn L, Whitsel L.

    "explanation": "B. complement factor H antibodies\nFor the patient described in the vignette, complement factor H (CFH) antibodies are most likely to be\nassociated with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Complement C1q deficiency is rare but\nassociated with the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus with rash and glomerulonephritis. Acquired\nsomatic mutations of phosphatidylinositol glycan class A in red blood cell precursors lead to\nparoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Mutations in ankyrin 1 lead to hereditary spherocytosis not\natypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).\nThe patient in the vignette presents with triad of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure\nconsistent with HUS. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of HUS is a thrombotic\nmicroangiopathy (TMA). Endothelial injury in the glomeruli leads to renal failure, and the\nmicroangiopathy results in platelet consumption and hemolysis, leading to anemia and\nthrombocytopenia. The microangiopathy can affect other vessels, leading to other complications,\nsuch as neurologic symptoms of seizures, coma, and death.\nThe most common type of HUS (90%) is diarrhea-associated forms of HUS (D+ HUS) typically\ncaused by Shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Atypical HUS (aHUS) refers to nondiarrheal\nHUS. However, D+ HUS and aHUS may be difficult to differentiate from one another because up to\none-third patients with aHUS may have diarrhea, as in this vignette. There are other (nondiarrheal)\ninfections that can also induce HUS, such as Streptococcus pneumonia.\nThe complement pathway is a component of the innate immune system and contributes to immune\nactivation by generation of cytokines, opsonization of pathogens, and cell lysis by the membrane\nattack complex (MAC). There are 3 mechanisms for complement activation: the classic complement\npathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative complement pathways (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1:\nSimplified version of complement activation:\nComplement fixing antibodies (IgG, IgM) activate the classic pathway via binding of C1q. This leads to a complex that\ncleave C2 and C4, allowing C4 convertase to form. C4 convertase cleaves C3 to C3b. Mannose binding lectins bind\nsugars on surfaces of bacteria. They form complexes also able to cleave C2 and C4 to form the C4 convertase.\nThe alternative complement pathway is constitutively active with a constant tickover cleavage to form C3bBb\ncomplexes (C3 convertase). C3 convertase cleave more C3, amplifying the complement response. Inhibitors of this\ncleavage (eg. Factor H, Factor I) regulate immune activation on cell surfaces. Mutations that lead to dysregulated\nalternative complement activation result in aHUS.\nAll three pathways converge with generation of C3b. C3b binds either C4aC2b or C3bBb to form C5 convertase. C5\nconvertase cleaves C5 to C5b, allowing MAC complex formation. (membrane attack complex = MAC)\nCourtesy of K. Reidy\nThe alternative complement pathway is constitutively active with a constant “tick over” of C3 to C3b.\nComplement factor D cleaves complement factor B (CFB), and a C3bBb complex forms (C3\nconvertase). The C3 convertase cleaves more C3 to C3b to amplify the activation. C3bBbC3b\ncomplexes form, known as C5 convertase. This cleaves C5 to C5a, allowing the MAC to form. The\nMAC can insert in cell membranes to induce cell lysis. Cleavages of C3 and C5 also release C3a and\nC5a, which serve as anaphylotoxins (cytokine-like peptides that stimulate leukocyte phagocytosis,\nincrease endothelial permeability, induce arterial smooth muscle wall contraction, and drive neutrophil\nchemotaxis).\nThe alternative complement system is tightly regulated to prevent activation. CFH is a cofactor for\ncomplement factor I (CFI). CFH prevents binding of C3b to cell surfaces and degrades C3 convertase\n(the C3bBb complex). CFI cleaves C3b to an inactive form. The membrane cofactor protein (MCP) is\na cofactor for CFI and promotes cleavage of C3b to the inactive form (iC3b). There are additional\nmechanisms to prevent activation. Complement receptor 1 also promotes the inactivation of C3b to\niC3b. There is a decay accelerating factor (DAF or CD55) that promotes degradation of C3 and C5\nconvertases. Finally, protectin (CD59) blocks the formation of the MAC.\nDefects in regulation of the alternative complement system that lead to overactivation of complement\nare associated with development of aHUS (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2:\nAlternative complement system highlighting how mutations and antibodies can lead to activation of complement and\naHUS (lightning symbol).

Am J Kidney Dis. 2013;61(2):289-29\nComplement component C3 is most often low with C3 and CFB mutations but can be low with all but\nCFHR 1 or 3 mutations. Antibodies to the complement regulatory system (anti-CFH or anti-CFI\nantibodies) also lead to aHUS. Anti-CFH antibodies are present in up to 6% of aHUS cases. They\nresult in a functional deficiency of CFH and prevent CFH binding to C3b. Because of the similarity\nbetween CFHR and CFH proteins, in addition to a direct effect on complement activation, CFHR\nmutations may predispose patients to form anti-CFH antibodies. Interestingly, mutations in\ndiacylglycerol kinase (DGKE) have been associated with aHUS but do NOT appear linked to\ncomplement activation.\nUp to 70% of aHUS cases will have an identifiable mutation. Approximately 10% may have more than\n1 mutation in different complement components. Identification of mutations may be helpful to predict\nprognosis in some cases. For example, mutations in MCP are one of the most common genetic\ncauses of aHUS and are primarily identified in children. Mutations in CFH, CFI, and CFB are\nassociated with high risk of aHUS recurrence after renal transplant, whereas MCP mutations have\nlow risk of recurrence after transplant. Complement mutations may also be present in secondary\nTMAs, such as TMAs associated with pregnancy, cobalamin C deficiency, malignant hypertension,\nand medication-related TMAs.\nEculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits cleavage and C5 incorporation in MAC\nand thus prevents terminal complement activation. Eculizumab is approved by the US Food and Drug\nAdministration for the treatment of aHUS. Because it prevents activation of alternative complement\npathway, patients are at higher risk of infection by encapsulated organisms, such as Neisseria\nmeningitidis. Thus, vaccination against meningitis is required before treatment.\nPREP Pearls\n Dysregulation of the alternative complement system leads to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n\n Mutations in the alternative complement system\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the role of complement abnormalities in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome\nSuggested Readings\n Alasfar S, Alachkar N.

    "explanation": "B. sickle cell trait likely largely contributed to this presentation\nThe patient in this clinical vignette has papillary necrosis secondary to sickle cell trait. Given her age\nand unremarkable medical history, sickle cell disease is unlikely. The presentation of painless gross\nhematuria in patients with sickle cell disease or trait should prompt the physician to include papillary\nnecrosis in the differential diagnosis. Although the clinical vignette could also indicate crystalluria or\nstones, the asymptomatic clinical presentation and family history do not support this diagnosis.\nAlthough exercise can induce transient gross and microscopic hematuria, exercise-induced hematuria\nshould be a diagnosis of exclusion and clots are unusual. A bleeding diathesis could lead to gross\nhematuria, but usually the patient will have other signs and symptoms of clotting abnormalities.\nFurthermore, a bleeding diathesis is rare compared to sickle cell trait. Thin glomerular basement\nmembrane disease rarely results in gross hematuria and is less likely than sickle cell trait. Of note,\nsickle cell trait is a risk factor for medullary renal cell carcinoma, which would be included in the\ndifferential diagnosis for a patient with sickle cell trait and gross hematuria.\nPapillary necrosis occurs focally when the vasculature in the medulla becomes infarcted. This\ninfarction leads to medullary fibrosis and loss of medullary collecting ducts. When the infarction is\nlarge enough, the papilla can be sloughed, and the patient can experience gross hematuria with\n“clots” as seen in this vignette. The “clots” are actually papillary tissue and not true fibrin clots. These\nsloughed tissue fragments can be large enough to cause obstruction and can lead to unilateral flank\npain.\nPapillary necrosis is associated with different conditions and clinical contexts. Sickle cell disease and\nsickle cell trait lead to sickling events in the vasa rectae in the medulla. Because the medulla has low\noxygen tension and pH, this scenario promotes sickling events even in patients with only sickle cell\ntrait. Diabetes, pyelonephritis, and analgesic abuse or chronic use are also associated with papillary\nnecrosis. Analgesic-associated papillary necrosis usually occurs in older patients with a history of\nlong-term use ofnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or combination analgesics. Phenacetin was\nonce the analgesic most associated with papillary necrosis, but it was removed from the market in\n1983. Interestingly, in contrast to sickle cell disease or trait, analgesic-associated papillary necrosis\nprimarily involves peritubular capillaries instead of the vasa rectae. During pyelonephritis, local\ninflammation in the medulla can lead to local impingement of vasculature and papillary necrosis. The\npatient in this vignette was asymptomatic, thus, pyelonephritis is unlikely.\nAlthough intravenous pyelography or computed tomography urography are not routinely performed\nduring clinical evaluation because of unnecessary radiation exposure, these imaging studies will\ndemonstrate extracalyceal contrast agent at the papillary tip, which is described as a “ball-on-tee” and\nshown by the arrows in the Figure.\n\nFigure: Angiomyolipoma.

The preferred terminology\nnow is papillary necrosis. Cortical necrosis, however, is a unique entity distinct from papillary\nnecrosis. Cortical necrosis usually occurs in patients with profound or prolonged hypoperfusion of the\nkidneys. In patients who have severe sepsis, endotoxin can damage endothelial cells and activate\nthrombosis accumulation in cortical vasculature.

    "explanation": "D. this child will develop progressive chronic kidney disease and worsening proteinuria in the next\ndecade\nThe patient in this vignette has polyuria, polydipsia, and failure to thrive. Laboratory and imaging\ninvestigations revealed evidence of chronic kidney disease, bilaterally small kidneys, and thickened\nrenal cortex with nephrograms that is consistent with oligomeganephronic renal hypoplasia. Renal\nultrasonography would show 2 small kidneys (less than fifth percentile for height), poor\ncorticomedullary differentiation, and no evidence of hydronephrosis. A renal biopsy, which is not\nnecessary for diagnosis, would show paucity of glomeruli that are 4 times the size of normal\nglomeruli, mesangial matrix expansion, tubular dilation, and mild tubulointerstitial fibrosis.\nRenal hypoplasia should be distinguished from other forms of congenital anomalies of the kidney and\nurinary tract characterized by small kidneys, such as renal hypodysplasia, segmental scarring caused\nby vesicoureteral reflux, diffuse scarring caused by congenital renal artery stenosis, and infantile\nnephronophthisis.\nThe 2 histological forms of renal hypoplasia are simple hypoplasia and oligomeganephronia, which\nare characterized by severe reduction in renal size and up to an 80% decrease in the number of\nnephrons (glomeruli). The glomeruli retain a normal volume in simple hypoplasia but are\nhypertrophied (at least 3-fold larger than normal age-adjusted glomeruli) in oligomeganephronia.\nOther features of oligomeganephronia are less than 5 renal lobes (normal number is more than 10),\nas well as a lack of cone-shaped medullary pyramids and the presence of thickened renal cortex and\nstriated nephrograms on contrast-enhanced computed tomography due to glomerular and proximal\ntubular hypertrophy. The prognosis in oligomeganephronia is guarded. Experimental studies of\nreduced renal mass in rodents have shown that glomerular hypertrophy is accompanied by\nglomerular hypertension, mesangial stretch, and activation of the local renin-angiotensin system,\nleading to release of inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines. The fibrotic cytokines lead to progressive\nrenal dysfunction and proteinuria. Most patients develop worsening proteinuria and renal function\nover 10 to 15 years, which results in end-stage renal disease. Accordingly, close monitoring and\nfollow-up of these patients is warranted.\nManagement of patients with renal hypoplasia depends on early identification of renal disease,\nprevention of repeated episodes of dehydration with adequate water and salt supplementation, and\nappropriate medical management of anemia and renal osteodystrophy. Some patients require gastric\ntube placement for continuous water and salt supplementation. Data from animal studies also\nsuggest that early initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may lower the proteinuria and\nslow (but not prevent) the progression of chronic renal disease.\nPREP Pearls\n The 2 types of renal hypoplasia are simple hypoplasia and oligomeganephronic hypoplasia. The latter is\nassociated with cortical thickening and striated nephrograms on computed tomography scan.\n In oligomeganephronic hypoplasia, glomerular hypertrophy is accompanied by progressive renal disease and\nproteinuria.\n Management of renal hypoplasia relies on judicious replacement of urinary fluid and electrolyte losses, as well\nas management of metabolic bone disease and anemia.

    "explanation": "C. only 9 glomeruli on the light microscopy sample\nRenal biopsy is often needed to accurately diagnose renal pathology. This procedure is not without\nrisk, especially in children. Therefore, steps should be taken to ensure that the obtained kidney tissue\nspecimen is adequate for accurate diagnosis, while also minimizing the risk of morbidity by limiting\nthe number of passes of the biopsy needle, and thus also the number of tissue cores obtained.\nHowever, the characteristics that make a kidney biopsy specimen adequate are not the same for all\nbiopsies. Specimen adequacy may vary according to the tissue source (native vs graft kidney) and\nthe clinical conditions being evaluated.\nRenal diseases may affect the different compartments of the kidney. Therefore, biopsy specimens\nshould allow for examination of each of the histologic elements (glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, and\nvasculature). Additionally, the specimens should be large enough to allow for light microscopy (LM),\nimmunofluorescence microscopy (IFM), and electron microscopy (EM) examinations of a native\nkidney biopsy. For certain diagnoses, IFM or EM findings are essential. In a review of adult native\nkidney biopsies, findings from EM were necessary for diagnosis in 21% of cases and provided\nsignificant refinement to the diagnosis in an additional 24% of cases. The diagnosis of IgA\nnephropathy/Henoch-Schonlein purpura, IgM nephropathy, C1q nephropathy, anti-glomerular\nbasement membrane disease, humoral (C4d) transplant rejection, or amyloidosis in children may be\nmissed without IFM. Moreover, the diagnosis of nail-patella syndrome, dense deposit disease, Alport\nsyndrome, or thin basement membrane disease in children may be missed without EM.\nFor transplant biopsy, LM and IFM are considered standard, and repeat biopsies often require only\nLM. However, with newer histopathologic findings associated with humoral rejection, such as C4d\ndeposition, IFM or immunohistochemistry is now considered requisite for most transplant biopsies,\nincluding repeat biopsies. For the vast majority of these cases, the IFM is performed to identify C4d\ndeposition in the peritubular capillaries or arteries; thus, the number of glomeruli would not matter as\nmuch. However, there can be occasions when the number of glomeruli on IFM specimen of a\ntransplant kidney biopsy is critical, such as in recurrence of IgA nephropathy or de novo\nantiglomerular basement membrane disease. Similarly, there are other renal disorders that might\nhave early changes on EM, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with early podocyte\neffacement, and EM may be requisite for accurate analysis in these cases. In this vignette, with\nrecurrence of FSGS being a strong possibility, a limited number of glomeruli on IFM is not critical for\nspecimen adequacy.\nThe volume of each tissue specimen is determined by the length of the tissue core and the caliber (or\ngauge) of the biopsy needle. Recommendations for adult renal biopsies have included obtaining 2\ncores, each at least 1 cm in length, by using a 14- or 16-gauge needle, as this approach provides at\nleast 5 mm2 of renal cortex. Eighteen-gauge needles give very narrow samples and may provide an\ninadequate representation of vessels. Studies in adults comparing 18-gauge needle biopsy\nspecimens to lower gauge (larger caliber) needles have shown a lower number of glomeruli sampled\nwith the narrower needles. However, in smaller pediatric patients, an 18-gauge needle may be more\nappropriate to avoid biopsy-related bleeding complications; the 18-gauge needles have been\nassociated with a lower incidence of macroscopic hematuria in this population, while still yielding\nenough tissue for accurate diagnosis.\nLonger tissue cores are more likely to provide more renal tissue overall, but may not necessarily\nprovide a greater yield of glomeruli. Medullary tissue, which has a very sparse distribution of\nglomeruli, is not considered requisite for specimen adequacy. However, the juxtamedullary glomeruli\nare the earliest to be affected by FSGS, so the deeper region of cortex may be more helpful in\ndiagnosing FSGS. Additionally,the subcapsular cortex may have an overrepresentation of glomeruli\n\nwith nonspecific scarring from hypertension or aging, especially in a transplant graft, so very\nsuperficial samples of the cortex may not accurately reflect the findings in its other parts.\nFor certain diffuse disorders, like membranous glomerulonephritis or amyloidosis, in which most\nglomeruli are affected, identification of a single glomerulus with classic findings is usually sufficient for\ndiagnosis. However, focal disorders, like FSGS, may have only a percentage of the glomeruli\ninvolved. Therefore, the biopsy sample must be large enough to contain these affected glomeruli in\norder to make an accurate diagnosis. As the prevalence of any focal disease is unknown prior to\nperforming a biopsy, some presumptions may be needed to improve the probability of making an\naccurate diagnosis. In a 1988 editorial, Corwin et al explained the statistics behind biopsy sampling:\n“If the actual prevalence of diseased glomeruli… is 10%, there is a 35% probability that no abnormal\nglomeruli will be found in a sample (of) only 10 glomeruli. When the biopsy contains 20 glomeruli, the\nprobability…is still 12%” (Am J Nephrol. 1988;8[2]:85-89). Others have cited 25 glomeruli as a\nstandard of adequacy, because this is the number needed to have a greater than 95% chance of\ndetecting low prevalence lesions on LM. Therefore, only 9 glomeruli on LM may be considered an\ninadequate number when looking for FSGS.\nSample size also plays a role when trying to quantify the extent of injury seen on biopsy. Whether\ntrying to determine the amount of interstitial fibrosis or the number of glomeruli with crescentic\nchange, a limited sample size may contribute to misclassification of disease extent, especially in\npatients diagnosed with moderate (vs mild or severe) disease. Corwin et al statistically modeled the\naccuracy of certain classification schema and found that the classification of moderate disease may\nbe accurate 75% of the time when only 10 glomeruli are sampled, but the accuracy would improve to\n85% when 20 glomeruli are sampled.\nA systematic approach of semiquantitative evaluation of renal biopsy specimens has been endorsed\nin several instances, such as the Oxford classification system for IgA nephropathy or the World\nHealth Organization classification system for lupus nephritis. In 1991, the Banff classification system\ndefined an adequate sample as containing at least 7 glomeruli and 1 artery. However, this definition\nwas refined in 1997 (published in 1999) to a minimum of 10 glomeruli and 2 arteries, while a marginal\nsample contains 7 to 10 glomeruli or 1 artery, and an unsatisfactory sample contains less than 7\nglomeruli or no arteries. By applying these criteria to the sample in this vignette, the presence of 2\narteries is considered adequate, and the presence of 9 glomeruli is considered marginal but not\nadequate. The marginal number of glomeruli does not mean that the biopsy results are inaccurate,\nbecause there may still be extensive rejection findings or findings of segmental sclerosis in several\nglomeruli.\nPREP Pearls\n For native kidney biopsy specimens, an adequate tissue specimen to allow for light, immunofluorescence, and\nelectron microscopy is necessary. For a transplant biopsy, only light microscopy and immunofluorescence\nmicroscopy may be needed, although electron microscopy may be helpful in some cases.\n If a disorder with focal findings (eg, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) is being strongly considered, a larger\nsample size of glomeruli may be needed for an accurate diagnosis.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Assess the adequacy of biopsy specimens\nSuggested Readings\n Corwin HL, Schwartz MM, Lewis EJ.

    "explanation": "B. discontinue the tacrolimus and mycophenolate, continue prednisolone\nThe patient in this vignette has a severe posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), including\ncentral nervous system involvement. Despite improvements in treatment and prognosis, PTLD\nremains a serious complication of kidney transplantation and continues to be associated with\nsuboptimal outcomes, such as significant mortality. In particular, central nervous system PTLD carries\na very high mortality rate.\nAlthough there are no randomized clinical trials of PTLD treatments, most guidelines and opinion\npapers recommend a reduction of overall immunosuppression as the first strategy in the management\nof PTLD. The type and extent of reduction is not clear and thus can be varied, such as reduction in all\nagents or selective elimination of certain agents. A common approach would be to eliminate the\nmycophenolate and decrease the goal tacrolimus level with no change in steroid dosing. In milder or\nearlier cases of PTLD, such reduction may be sufficient to restore immune responses to the PTLD,\nespecially if driven by Epstein-Barr virus replication.\nIn moderately severe cases of PTLD or cases that do not respond to initial immunosuppression\nreduction, a variety of other agents are then recommended, such as rituximab, chemotherapy\nmedications, or both. Gross et al have demonstrated a 70% complete response rate of a composite\noutcome (patient survival, relapse-free, allograft survival) of a rituximab–low dose chemotherapy\nregimen in a multicenter cohort of children with PTLD after solid organ transplant. In adults, the\nmulticenter PTLD-1 trial showed similar efficacy of a rituximab–standard chemotherapy regimen.\nWhen a patient has central nervous system PTLD, the prognosis is much worse. In such situations,\nmost transplantation professionals agree that a staged approach starting with reduction of\nimmunosuppression is not enough. Therefore, an almost complete elimination of immunosuppression\nis recommended. If the patient is on a steroid-free regimen, then complete elimination is advised.\nSteroids, however, are part of the lymphoma-based chemotherapy regimens used in the treatment of\nPTLD. Therefore, continuing prednisolone would be appropriate in this situation. An immediate and\nabrupt withdrawal of prednisolone that has been administered for a long time is not advisable,\nbecause it poses a risk for inducing pseudotumor cerebri. Therefore, discontinuation of tacrolimus\nand mycophenolate and continued prednisolone is the preferred treatment approach.\nThis case highlights the dilemma of having to choose between patient survival and allograft survival.\nA near or complete cessation of immunosuppression would expose the allograft to an acute rejection\nepisode and create a 4-fold higher risk of allograft failure. In kidney transplantation, there is the\nfallback option of maintaining a patient on chronic dialysis in case the allograft fails. Therefore, patient\nsurvival should always take precedence over allograft survival in such situations. Unfortunately, other\nsolid organ recipients, such as lung and heart transplant recipients, may not have this luxury,\nbecause in these situations, allograft failure can frequently mean patient death. When PTLD occurs in\na lung transplant recipient, chemotherapy is instituted in the context of maintained\nimmunosuppression.\nPREP Pearls\n In the appropriate context, patient survival generally takes preference over allograft survival.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the post-transplant dilemmas of choosing patient survival at the expense of graft survival\nSuggested Readings\n Dharnidharka VR, Webster AC, Martinez OM, Preiksaitis JK, Leblond V, Choquet S.

    "correct_index": 3,
    "explanation": "D. she should have liver ultrasonography to look for liver fibrosis and bile duct dilatation associated\nwith autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease\nPatients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) uniformly have liver fibrosis on\na microscopic level at birth, with about half having clinically detectable disease (hepatosplenomegaly,\nesophageal varices, or both) as neonates. Liver manifestations include congenital hepatic fibrosis,\nCaroli syndrome (nonobstructed dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts), and common bile duct\ndilatation. About three-fourths of patients will develop portal hypertension related to hepatic fibrosis.\nAbout two-thirds of patients will have bile duct abnormalities that can lead to cholangitis, vitamin\nmalabsorption (fat soluble vitamins including A, D, E, and K), and long-term risk of tumors (both\nbenign and malignant including cholangiocarcinoma). Some patients manifest a predominantly\nhepatic phenotype with minimal or no renal involvement. The percentage of such patients is\nunknown. Thus, in this patient with a severely affected sibling with liver involvement, normal renal\nultrasonography results would not exclude ARPKD, and high resolution ultrasonography of the liver\nshould be performed, especially with the clinical findings of a firm liver edge.\nAs noted above, portal hypertension and biliary disease are common manifestations of ARPKD.\nSynthetic dysfunction is rare, especially early in the disease. Thus, checking liver synthetic function in\nthis child is unlikely to be helpful in making a diagnosis.\nThe polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 gene (PKHD1) is a large gene (470 kb) with 86 exons\nand alternative splice variants. In patients with clinical ARPKD, genetic analysis requires both\nsequence analysis and deletion/duplication analysis to reach an almost 80% detection rate for\npathologic variants (ie, genetic confirmation). Thus, genetic testing is uninformative (negative test\nresult with positive phenotype, false negative) in about 20% of patients with clinical ARPKD.\nHowever, if the pathologic gene variants of the deceased sibling are known, then genetic analysis for\nthis child can determine if similar variants are present. In older studies, the detection of pathologic\nmutations in patients with liver-predominant disease was about half that of patients with a severe\nrenal phenotype.\nThe age at presentation influences survival and phenotype. Individuals diagnosed at less than 1 year\nof age typically have renal enlargement, and about half have hepatosplenomegaly. The 10-year\nsurvival rate is about 70%. In children who are diagnosed at older than 1 year of age, liver\ncomplications such as variceal bleeding or cholangitis are more common at presentation, with renal\nenlargement being less common (about one-third). The 10-year survival rate is over 90% in this\ngroup. At 10 years of age, about 10% of diagnosed ARPKD patients will have required a liver\ntransplant, and about 60% will have received a kidney transplant. In one series of children with\nARPKD who received a kidney transplant, 80% of the early deaths were related to liver disease\n(mostly infection related to bile duct disease). In addition, the liver disease typically progresses with\nworsening of portal hypertension that may require sclerotherapy, banding of varices, or transjugular\nintrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement for management.\nPREP Pearls\n Individuals with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease may have severe liver disease with minimal or\nno kidney disease.\n For screening purposes, both kidney and liver high-resolution ultrasonography are needed.\n Individuals with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease who have a kidney transplant may experience\nsignificant morbidity and mortality related to liver disease.\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the spectrum of liver disease in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, including long term\ncomplications\nSuggested Readings\n Adeva M, El-Youssef M, Rossetti S, et al.

Obstruction can occur anywhere along the urinary tract and can range from\npartial unilateral obstruction to complete bilateral obstruction. In each scenario, increased pressure is\ntransmitted to the renal interstitium. When present before birth, this elevated pressure can lead to\nrenal maldevelopment. When present in infancy and early childhood, the elevated pressure can lead\nto progressive renal failure. When urinary obstruction persists, irreversible interstitial fibrosis and\nglomerulosclerosis can develop. Animal studies have provided evidence that the severity of renal\ndamage is associated with the duration and severity of obstruction before birth. Early diagnosis and\npostnatal intervention is therefore essential to preserve renal function and prevent further decline.\nAlthough relieving obstruction soon after birth can halt this process and improve functional\nparameters, such as blood pressure and serum creatinine levels, it does not eliminate the risk for\nchronic kidney disease progression. Interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, and tubular atrophy can\noccur and progress in the previously obstructed kidney, as well as in the nonobstructed kidney in\nindividuals with unilateral disease. Therefore, individuals with a history of obstructive uropathy are at\nrisk for glomerular filtration rate decline as well as the development of proteinuria and hypertension\nthroughout their lifespan, and they require follow-up throughout adulthood.\nThe clinical outcomes of children with urinary tract obstruction are wide and varied. A child with mild\nunilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction may experience minimal renal sequelae, whereas a child\nwith bladder outlet obstruction may develop severe renal injury with complete loss of function. It is\noften difficult to predict renal function and outcome; but, in general, the duration of obstruction\n(chronic vs acute), the timing of obstruction (prenatal vs after nephrogenesis is complete), the degree\nof obstruction (complete vs partial, bilateral vs unilateral), and the immediate response after relief of\nobstruction can be used to risk stratify individuals for progressive kidney disease. In addition,\ncharacteristics associated with worse renal prognosis include earlier gestational age at diagnosis,\ncoexisting vesicoureteral reflux, echogenic kidneys on ultrasonography, history of urinary tract\ninfections, higher creatinine level at 1 year of age, development of hypertension, and the presence of\nproteinuria.\nIn the vignette above, there is evidence of significant obstructive uropathy with a diagnosis of\nposterior urethral valves (PUV), bilateral ureteronephrosis, and oligohydramnios. In severe cases of\nPUV, the kidneys are poorly developed and have minimal function. In addition, many children have\nassociated pulmonary hypoplasia, which causes mortality among children with PUV.\nIn developed countries, mortality among children with severe PUV has decreased from 50% in the\n1950s to close to 1% currently. Although overall survival has improved dramatically, the majority of\nchildren with prenatally diagnosed PUV will experience renal insufficiency and complications related\nto chronic kidney disease before their 10th birthday. A small subset of children experience no long-\nterm effects related to PUV, but this outcome cannot be predicted with precision; therefore, close\nlong-term follow-up is essential.\nPrenatal diagnosis may help prevent the development of fatal pulmonary hypoplasia by interventions\nsuch as decompression of the urinary system, but there is no evidence that prenatal diagnosis\nchanges long-term renal outcome.\nPREP Pearls\n The clinical outcomes of children with urinary tract obstruction range from minimal renal sequelae to end-stage\nrenal disease.\n\n Children with obstructive uropathy must be closely followed through adulthood to monitor for the progression of\nchronic kidney disease.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the renal prognosis for patients with urethral valves, ureterovesicular junction obstruction, and\nureteropelvic junction obstruction\nSuggested Readings\n Chevalier RL, Peters CA.

Urinary protein electrophoresis showing a mixed glomerular and tubular pattern and the\npresence of elevated urinary β2-microglobulin levels (greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal)\nare consistent with a diagnosis of Dent disease. Microscopic hematuria is very common. Tubular\ndysfunction can manifest with a urine concentrating defect, hypophosphatemia, amino aciduria, and\nrickets. Some patients have nephrotic-range proteinuria with glomerulosclerosis. Other patients have\nhypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis similar to Bartter syndrome. In addition, vitamin A–responsive\nnight blindness occurs in some patients.\nDiagnostic findings in Dent disease can include:\n Low molecular weight proteinuria (typically present)\n Hypercalciuria (typically present)\n Hematuria\n Nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis\n Hypophosphatemia\nApproximately 60% of individuals with Dent disease have a mutation in CLCN5 (Dent disease type 1),\nwhich encodes a voltage-gated chloride proton exchanger. Approximately 15% of individuals with\nDent disease have a mutation in OCRL1 (Dent disease type 2), which encodes an inositol\npolyphosphate 5 phosphatase. Interestingly, about 15% of individuals with Lowe syndrome have\nmutations in OCRL1. Therefore, individuals suspected of having Dent disease should be assessed for\neye diseases (congenital cataracts and glaucoma) and developmental issues associated with Lowe\nsyndrome.\nDent disease is typically described as an X-linked recessive disorder. However, female carriers can\nhave high levels of urinary β2-microglobulin, and some carriers progress to severe nephrocalcinosis\nand renal failure. This progression is thought to be caused by unfavorable X inactivation.\nStudies of Dent disease families reveal that progressive nephrocalcinosis and chronic kidney disease\nare more common in families with CLCN5 mutations. However, the disease can have variable\nseverity even within a kindred. Hypercalciuria and low molecular weight proteinuria are consistent\nfindings, while nephrocalcinosis develops in three-fourths of patients and renal insufficiency develops\nin two-thirds of patients. End-stage kidney disease typically occurs in the fourth or fifth decade of life,\nand the disease does not recur after transplant. Rickets or osteomalacia occurs in one-fourth of male\nindividuals with disease.\nTreatment of hypercalciuria is similar to treatment of patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria and stone\ndisease (sodium restriction and thiazide diuretics).

Brady\nThe physical examination results and past medical history of the child in this vignette are\nunremarkable, and the laboratory test results are only notable for hypokalemia. This presentation,\nalong with her family history, raises concern for a monogenic cause of hypertension. Therefore, the\nmeasurement of plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels would be the most likely testing\nto reveal the etiology of her hypertension. Among children with an elevated clinic blood pressure, 24-\nhour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is most useful when evaluating for white coat\nhypertension and for individuals with persistent hypertension despite escalating doses of\nantihypertensive medications; however, nothing from her history is suggestive of these possibilities.\nEchocardiography would be helpful in determining if she has left ventricular hypertrophy but will not\nhelp diagnose the underlying cause for hypertension. If she had a cardiac cause of her hypertension,\nit would likely have been evident from history or physical examination. Polysomnography is helpful in\nevaluating for obstructive sleep apnea, which can cause resistant hypertension; however, she does\nnot have any risk factors (obesity), physical examination findings (adenotonsillar hypertrophy), or\nhistory (snoring, daytime somnolence) suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea.\nPREP Pearls\n All children with confirmed hypertension should be evaluated for a secondary cause of hypertension.\n Initial evaluation of hypertension should include a detailed history (including medical, family, and birth history),\nphysical examination, laboratory testing (electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, fasting\nglucose, fasting lipids), and imaging (renal and bladder ultrasonography, echocardiography).\n\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the differential diagnosis of sustained hypertension\nSuggested Readings\n Ehret GB, Caulfield MJ.

    "explanation": "A. 99mTc-coupled radiotracer that is cleared by tubular secretion\nHydronephrosis is the most common prenatal ultrasound finding, and its detection has increased in\nrecent years with advanced ultrasonography equipment and techniques. The majority (50%-70%) of\nprenatal hydronephrosis is transient and most likely physiologic. When hydronephrosis persists or\nurinary tract infection occurs, follow-up studies are needed to exclude the possibility of a congenital\nanomaly. Specifically, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and obstruction must be considered as potential\netiologies. A voiding cystourethrogram can assess bladder morphology and urethral abnormalities\nsuch as posterior urethral valves.\nTo assess obstructions at the ureterovesical or ureteropelvic junctions, MAG3\n(mercaptoacetyltriglycine) diuretic renography is the test of choice. The procedure involves\nradiotracer injection into a peripheral intravenous site. A urinary catheter is recommended to eliminate\nany intravesicular pressure that may prevent upper tract drainage. Unlike a DMSA\n(dimercaptosuccinic acid) scan, which requires circulation and parenchymal uptake for a period of\ntime, MAG3 images are recorded immediately. Usually, 20 minutes after injection, a dose of\nfurosemide is given and drainage is further recorded. Time-course drainage curves and image\nexamination can determine split function of kidneys as well as laterality of obstructions. Because of\ntubular immaturity, this test is more likely to be accurate after 6 to 8 weeks of age.\nIn the patient in this vignette, a voiding cystourethrogram excluded VUR and urethral anomalies such\nas posterior urethral valves. A 99mTc-coupled radiotracer is filtered by glomeruli and excreted during\nDTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid) scintigraphy, which would be useful in determining\nglomerular filtration rate and can provide drainage information. Compared to a MAG3 scan, this test is\ninferior in providing drainage information because of a lower target to background ratio leading to\npoorer image quality, especially in the setting of obstruction. Because this child does not have an\nabnormal serum creatinine level, assessment of glomerular filtration rate is not indicated. A 99mTc-\ncoupled radiotracer is injected intravesically in radionuclide cystography. This test is a nuclear\nmedicine study used to assess for VUR, but with less radiation than a typical voiding\ncystourethrogram and increased sensitivity. The likelihood of high-grade VUR leading to\nhydronephrosis is low because the initial voiding cystourethrogram had negative results; therefore,\nradionuclide cystography is of low yield. A 99mTc-coupled radiotracer is filtered and excreted in the\nurine (40%) and fix in tubular cells (60%) during DMSA scintigraphy. A DMSA scan can be helpful in\nassessing parenchymal defects that would be seen in VUR nephropathy but is not particularly helpful\nin assessing obstruction. The best study to determine drainage of the urinary tract is MAG3 diuretic\nrenography, which will demonstrate delayed drainage in an obstructed system. A 99mTc-coupled\nradiotracer cleared by tubular secretion is used in MAG3 renography. Radionuclides and their uses\nare summarized in the Table.\n\nTable.

Classic renal manifestations of\nnephronophthisis include progressive chronic kidney disease, impaired urinary concentration function\npresenting as polydipsia and polyuria (in particular, nocturnal polyuria), relative short stature, and\nmarked anemia from erythropoietin deficiency disproportionate to the degree of renal insufficiency.\nThe renal insufficiency relates to the marked tubulointerstitial fibrosis.\nNephronophthisis may also be associated with nonrenal clinical features (Table) that are sometimes\ncorrelated with the specific genotypes.\nTable.

Weinstein\nDepending on the combination of nonrenal features, the condition may be part of a multisystem\nsyndrome, such as Joubert syndrome (nephronophthisis, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and\nbrainstem anomalies) or Senior-Loken syndrome. Senior-Loken syndrome is a more common\nnephronophthisis syndrome that presents with classic renal features together with impaired night\nvision (from retinitis pigmentosa) often in the school-aged to adolescent years. Infantile oculomotor\napraxia (difficulty in controlled eye movement) may be another nonrenal clinical presentation of\nnephronophthisis, as seen in the adolescent girl in this vignette.\nNPHP1 mutations are the most common genetic etiology of nephronophthisis and are seen in almost\nhalf of cases presenting in the school-aged or adolescent years. Of the answer choices\nlisted, NPHP1 mutation analysis is the most likely test to be diagnostic. NPHP1 encodes the protein\nnephrocystin-1. However, genetic testing is not required for clinical diagnosis and may not always be\ndefinitive. Infantile presentations may be associated with NPHP2, NPHP3, and NPHP9 mutations,\nalthough NPHP2 mutations exclusively cause an infantile presentation. An increasing number of\ngenes are being identified as genetic etiologies of nephronophthisis, yet many cases remain\ngenetically unexplained. Nearly all the genes identified are directly or indirectly related to nonmotile\ncilia function. Therefore, nephronophthisis is generally classified as a “ciliopathy.”\nThe anemia of the adolescent girl in this vignette, in particular with a normal mean corpuscular\nvolume, is most likely secondary to erythropoietin deficiency rather than iron deficiency. Results of\nurinalysis and microscopy in nephronophthisis are most often bland and unrevealing. Although\nurinalysis may be helpful in excluding alternative diagnoses, the results are unlikely to be diagnostic\nin this case. Renal ultrasonography may reveal smaller than normal, hyperechoic kidneys. Medullary\ncysts are sometimes but not always seen. Such findings might be suggestive of nephronophthisis but\nwould not be diagnostic.\n\nPREP Pearls\n Renal manifestations of nephronophthisis include progressive chronic kidney disease in childhood, urinary\nconcentrating impairment, short stature, and marked anemia.\n Nephronophthisis may be associated with extrarenal manifestations including retinal, oculomotor, central\nnervous system, skeletal, and hepatobiliary conditions.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the renal and nonrenal features of nephronophthisis including infantile and syndromic forms\nSuggested Readings\n Arts HH, Knoers NVAM.

    "explanation": "C. next-generation whole exome sequencing\nIn the current era of precision medicine, the most likely molecular test to yield a specific etiology in a\nchild with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) is whole exome or genome\nsequencing. Array comparative genome hybridization, mass spectrometry of the urinary proteome,\nand urinary and blood metabolomics profiles can be helpful in identifying defective biochemical\npathways but are unlikely to identify the specific defect causing CAKUT.\nInitial studies of CAKUT (and other renal disease such as IgA nephropathy and idiopathic\nmembranous nephropathy) relied on genome-wide association studies. For example, a large family\npedigree showed that a chromosomal region statistically co-segregates with CAKUT, leading to the\nidentification of a disease locus (usually stretching over 1 or more megabases). Direct DNA\nsequencing of suspected target genes can identify the co-segregating mutation. But, the proof that\nthis mutation is harmful relies on additional family members with the same genotype/phenotype\ncorrelation as well as demonstration of pathogenicity in animal or cell model systems.\nChanges in DNA copy number (copy number variations), which are caused by duplication or loss of\ngenetic material and usually encompass multiple genes, can be detected by array comparative\ngenomic hybridization. This technique is used in clinical practice, especially in prenatal care and for\nthe diagnosis of developmental defects. Copy number variations are found in a significant number of\ndevelopmental disorders, ranging from random isolated organ dysgenesis to multi–organ system\nsyndromes. Copy number variations are defined as gain or loss of at least 1 kb of DNA (up to several\nmegabases). An example of a disorder discovered by array comparative genomic hybridization is the\nchild with CAKUT and severe developmental delay who has subtelomeric deletion of chromosome 9\ncontaining the gene encoding human histone lysine methyltransferase 1 (mutated in Kleefstra\nsyndrome). A multicenter study identified a copy number variation of 250 kb or greater in 17% of\npatients with CAKUT. Interestingly, known copy-number genetic syndromes are frequently\naccompanied by an abnormal urinary tract (eg, DiGeorge syndrome, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome).\nHowever, with the continuous decrease in costs of next-generation whole genome or exome\nsequencing, it is likely that these technologies will enhance the ability to detect rare genetic variants.\nIn addition to analysis of DNA sequence and structural variants, metabolic, genetic, and acquired\ndisorders can be classified based on their proteomic profiles determined by 2-dimensional gel\nelectrophoresis and mass spectrometry. However, these techniques are labor intensive, and a\npeptide mass fingerprint is lacking for most common disorders. On the other hand, tests of urinary\nbiomarkers, such as KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule 1) and NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated\nlipocalin), are available and can guide diagnosis and treatment options for acute and chronic kidney\ninjury as well as aid in renal research.\nPREP Pearls\n In the current genomic era, several molecular tools are available to the clinician. Perhaps the most useful\napplication involves the widespread use of array comparative genome hybridization.\n The decreasing costs and turn-around time for next-generation whole exome or genome sequencing will likely\nmake these techniques the tests of choice for the diagnosis of both rare and common disorders.\n Urinary biomarkers have the potential to illuminate diagnosis, management, and prognosis in acute and\nchronic renal disease.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the applications of genomics, proteomics and metabolomics in the field of renal research\n\nSuggested Readings\n Decramer S, Wittke S, Mischak H, et al.

    "explanation": "D. OCRL1\nLowe (oculocerebrorenal) syndrome is characterized by ophthalmic, cerebral, and renal defects.\nLowe syndrome is rare, with an estimated disease prevalence of 1:500,000. The manifestations of\nLowe syndrome vary with age. Lowe syndrome is caused by mutations in OCRL1. OCRL1 is located\non the X chromosome, and Lowe syndrome has an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. The\nOCRL-1 protein is an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase.\nThe classic renal manifestations of Lowe syndrome are low molecular weight proteinuria and\nalbuminuria. Low molecular weight proteinuria can be defined by assessing retinol-binding protein or\nα1- or β2-microglobulin. Albumin excretion is often in the nephrotic range (>1 g/m2/d) but serum\nalbumin levels remain normal. The albuminuria is thought to result from impaired megalin-mediated\nendocytosis of filtered albumin in the proximal tubule. Hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis are\npresent in two-thirds of patients. About one-third of patients have renal tubular acidosis. Renal\nmanifestations generally appear in the first weeks or months after birth. More than 70% of patients\nwith Lowe syndrome develop progressive renal failure that requires dialysis. Secondary focal\nglomerulosclerotic lesions may be seen on biopsy. The most common ophthalmic presentation is\ncongenital bilateral cataracts. Intellectual disability is the most common central nervous system\nmanifestation. However, Lowe syndrome affects multiple organs and has many manifestations\n(Table).\n\nTable.

The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of\nLowe: an update. Pediatr Nephrol. 2016;31(12):2201-2212.\nSome important clinical features differentiate Lowe syndrome from other proximal tubular defects.\nFirst, glycosuria is rare in Lowe syndrome. Phosphaturia may be present in up to 40% of patients, but\nis thought to be primarily caused by elevated parathyroid hormone. Defects in absorption of vitamin\nD–binding protein, rather than in the level of vitamin D, appear to cause the rickets and osteomalacia\nthat are present in up to 50% of patients with Lowe syndrome.\nOCRL1 has 2 splice variants, with an alternative larger splice variant of exon 18a predominantly\nexpressed in the brain. Over 200 gene variants are associated with Lowe syndrome, and 10% to 20%\nof patients have no identifiable mutations. Two-thirds of patients with Lowe syndrome have mutations\n(frameshift, nonsense, or splice site) that lead to loss of gene expression by mRNA decay or\npremature truncation. The remaining one-third have complete deletions or missense mutations.\n\nInterestingly, OCRL1 variants are also associated with Dent disease type 2. OCRL1 has 23 exons;\npatients with Dent disease type 2 have frameshift or nonsense mutations in the first 7 exons or\nmissense mutations in exons 9 to 21. Dent disease type 2 is characterized by hypercalciuria and the\nlow molecular weight proteinuria that is typical of all types of Dent disease. In addition, a small\nproportion of the patients have mild intellectual deficits, hypotonia, and subclinical cataracts.\nHowever, genotype-phenotype correlations are variable as the same mutation may present in Dent\nsyndrome or Lowe syndrome.\nThe OCRL1 protein is an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase that removes a phosphate from\nphosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. It has several\nprotein domains, including actin and GTPase binding domains. OCRL1 localizes to the trans-Golgi\nnetwork and clathrin-coated endocytic structures (Figure).\nFigure. Effects of OCRL1 loss of function.\nAbbreviations: N, nucleus; TGN, trans-Golgi network. Courtesy of K. Reidy\nIn vitro studies have demonstrated that loss of OCRL1 perturbs several cellular processes, including\nGTPase-regulated membrane trafficking to apical and basolateral domains and actin remodeling. In\naddition, effects on cell migration, ciliogenesis, and cell division have been reported. It is not entirely\nclear how these defects translate into the Lowe phenotype, but human mutations affect localization of\nOCRL1 to the endosome, suggesting that its role in endocytic recycling is important. All affected cell\ntypes (neurons, optic lens epithelium, and renal epithelial cells) are highly polarized, suggesting that\ndefects in polarity may also be important in the phenotype.\nThere are limited treatment options for renal manifestations of Lowe syndrome. The long-term\noutcome is typically slow progression to end-stage kidney disease by 20 to 30 years of\nage. Potassium citrate may be used in the setting of acidosis and with nephrocalcinosis. Thiazide\ndiuretics, while helpful for nephrocalcinosis, carry a greater risk of electrolyte disturbances in Lowe\nsyndrome and would need to be used with caution. Patients with hypophosphatemic rickets may\nrequire 1-OH cholecalciferol and phosphate supplements. Dental, ophthalmologic, orthopedic, and\nneurology specialists may be necessary for management of extrarenal disease. Because of bleeding\ndisorders, a hematologist should be consulted prior to surgical procedures. Angiotensin-converting\nenzyme inhibitors may be considered to slow progression of chronic kidney disease.\n\nThe patient in this vignette exhibits the triad of congenital cataracts, cognitive impairment, and\nproteinuria as well as seizures, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis, which are typical of Lowe\nsyndrome. Thus, mutations in OCRL1are the most likely genetic defect. Mutations in ATP6V1B1,\nwhich encodes the B1-subunit of H+-ATPase, are also associated with hypercalciuria and\nnephrocalcinosis, but would also be expected to cause significant renal tubular\nacidosis. CTNS1 mutations are associated with nephropathic cystinosis, which would be expected to\npresent with more generalized Fanconi syndrome with more severe acidosis and glucosuria and does\nnot typically present with seizures or cataracts. Mutations in NKCC2 are associated with Bartter\nsyndrome, which can exhibit nephrocalcinosis and hypercalciuria; however, the patient in this vignette\nlacks alkalosis and hypokalemia.\nPREP Pearls\n Classic Lowe syndrome presents with the triad of congenital cataracts, intellectual disability, and low molecular\nweight proteinuria and albuminuria.\n OCRL1 mutations are associated with both Lowe syndrome and Dent disease type 2.\n Lowe syndrome presents with selective proximal tubular defects; low molecular weight proteinuria and\nalbuminuria, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis are common, but persistent glucosuria is not common and\nacidosis is often mild.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the molecular and genetic basis for Lowe syndrome\n Know clinical features of Lowe syndrome\n Know the treatment, complications and long-term outcomes of Lowe syndrome\nSuggested Readings\n Bökenkamp A, Ludwig M.

    ],
    "correct_index": 1,
    "explanation": "B. he is at elevated risk for having hypertension susceptibility risk alleles, and mechanistic treatment\nwith a diuretic may be indicated\nThe patient in this vignette is Amish. The ancestors of the Amish people were a limited number of\nimmigrants from Switzerland in the early 18th century; thus, the founder population was small. The\nAmish population is relatively closed, leading to a higher risk of recessive genetic disease. These\ncharacteristics combined with a fairly uniform lifestyle have facilitated the discovery of hypertensive\nsusceptibility genes by using genome-wide association studies in a limited Amish population. The first\nhypertensive susceptibility gene identified in this fashion is STK39, the serine threonine kinase 39\ngene, which encodes the Ste20-related proline-alanine–rich kinase (SPAK) protein involved in sodium\nchannel function. This protein regulates the Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) function and\nphosphorylates the thiazide-sensitive Na+/Cl− cotransporter (NCC), which is loop diuretic sensitive. In\nthe initial description, the risk alleles were associated with about a 10 mm Hg difference in systolic\nblood pressure.\nThis finding has been confirmed and expanded in a Belgian study of STK39 and the upstream\nregulatory protein with no lysine kinase 1 (WNK1). A homozygous susceptibility genotype (single\nnucleotide polymorphism) in STK39was found in 7.3% of the hypertensive population, rendering an\nalmost 6-fold odds ratio of hypertension and a 10 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure.\nSimilarly, a homozygous risk allele in WNK1 was found in 5.5% of the hypertensive population,\nrendering a 4-fold odds ratio of hypertension and a slightly less than 10 mm Hg increase in systolic\nblood pressure.\nTraditional monogenic causes of hypertension may be associated with physical signs (Table 1),\nwhich may be related to elevated renin production (polycystic kidney disease, conditions associated\nwith renal or aortic stenosis, or renal masses).\nTable 1.

    ],
    "correct_index": 1,
    "explanation": "B. 16-year-old female adolescent with a 1.5-cm calcium oxalate dihydrate stone in the right upper\npole\nExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was first used clinically in 1980 to treat adults with\nurolithiasis. Because it is less invasive, has a high safety profile, and has minimal morbidity, it is a\npopular treatment alternative when medical management fails with symptomatic kidney stones. Since\nits first use in children in 1986, it has also become a preferred first-line treatment in pediatric\nurolithiasis. However, ESWL is not always the best treatment option for some types of urolithiasis or\nunder certain treatment conditions.\nHigh-energy shock waves are generated by an electrical discharge within the lithotripter that is\ndirected by using radiography. When there is a change in tissue density from soft (like the kidney and\nother organs) to hard (like the stone), there is a release of energy at the interface of these different\ndensities, in this case the stone’s surface. This energy release can cause stress waves from the\nexternal surface of the stone, which travel internally within the stone and can be amplified by\nirregularities and angles on the stone surface. The result is a compressive effect directed inwardly\nthat, when done repetitively and with enough intensity, causes stone fragmentation from within.\nAdditionally, the release of energy from shock waves may also cause the formation of bubbles, or\ncavitation, on the surface of the stone. These bubbles may burst, and the pressure from the collapse\nof these bubbles may erode the stone’s outer surface. Thus, these 2 processes, the internal direct\nstress and the external cavitation effect, may act in concert to pulverize the stone into smaller\nfragments.\nThe targeted width of the lithotripter, in essence the focal width of shock waves, should be just slightly\nwider than the stone size for greatest efficacy. Lower frequency (60 Hz) shock wave pulses are more\neffective than higher frequency (120 Hz) treatments, possibly by allowing more time for the formation\nof cavitating bubbles. The initiation of treatment with lower power pulses with a gradual increase over\ntime is also more effective than using higher power pulses throughout the treatment.\nFactors that influence the success of ESWL in adults are summarized in the Table.\nTable. Patient and stone predictors of the success of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.\nCalculus size Size is inversely proportional to the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy results (> 2\ncm has poorer results).\nCalculus density High density (> 1000 Hounsfield units) calculi have worse results.\nCalculus location Lower pole calculi have worse results than upper and mid-pole.\nCalyceal calculi have worse outcomes than renal pelvis.\nDistal ureteral calculi have worse outcomes than proximal ureter.\nSkin-to-stone Distances > 9 cm negatively affect results.\ndistance\nRenal anomalies Kidneys with congenital anomalies have lower elimination rates.\nExcretory path Infundibulopelvic angle > 90°, infundibular length > 3 cm, and width < 5 mm are less\nfavorable anatomy with worse outcomes.\nAdapted and reprinted with permission from Torricelli FCM, Danilovic A, Vicentini FC, Marchini GS, Srougi M, Mazzucchi E.\nExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in the treatment of renal and ureteral stones. Rev Assoc Med Bras. 2015; 61(1):65-71.\nClearance rates are 66% to 99% for calculi less than 2 cm in diameter and 45% to 70% for calculi 20\nto 30 mm in diameter. Therefore, the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for the\nmanagement of stones in adults recommend that ESWL should not be offered as first-line therapy for\nstones bigger than 20 mm, although it should be considered a first-line therapy, along with\nureteroscopy, in pediatric patients with stones smaller than 20 mm.\n\nStaghorn calculi, which branch out to fill the renal pelvis and sometimes extend into calyces, are very\nlarge and have a high recurrence rate if not completely cleared. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy, not\nESWL, is the first-line treatment for such stones.\nDenser stone material is more difficult to pulverize with ESWL. Cystine, calcium oxalate\nmonohydrate, and calcium phosphate (brushite) are harder crystalline materials that are less\nsuccessfully treated with ESWL. Calcium oxalate dihydrate, uric acid, and magnesium ammonium\nphosphate (struvite) have softer compositions and are more amenable to shock wave treatment.\nHowever, uric acid calculi are radiolucent and therefore may not be as easily located for directing\nshock wave treatments.\nExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy may be used to treat both renal and ureteral stones, but yields\ndifferent results based on the location of the calculus. Upper and mid-pole kidney stones have very\ngood clearance rates, as do stones in the renal pelvis, as compared to stones within the calyx. Lower\npole stones have decreased success rates with ESWL, likely because of poorer clearance of stone\nfragments. Therefore, the AUA guidelines indicate that ESWL should not be the first-line therapy for\nlower pole stones that are bigger than 10 mm.\nSimilarly, for ureteral stones, ESWL may be considered for mid and distal ureteral stones, but\nureteroscopy has significantly better results for stones in these locations and should be the preferred\nfirst-line therapy. A meta-analysis of studies comparing stone-free rates for distal ureteral stones\nshowed ureteroscopy to be effective 92% of the time with a single treatment, as compared to a 65%\nsuccess rate for ESWL. Additionally, ESWL is even less effective with ureteral stones composed of\ncystine and uric acid, so it is recommended that ureteroscopy be considered specifically when these\ntypes of ureteral calculi are suspected. Ureteroscopy does have a slightly higher complication risk\nthan ESWL, specifically for ureteral perforation. For women of childbearing age with mid or distal\nureteral calculi, ESWL should be used conservatively because the effects of shock waves on the\novary have not been completely elucidated.\nThe indications for ESWL in pediatric patients are similar to its indications in adults. It should be\noffered to patients who do not pass ureteral stones after a period of observation or are unlikely to\npass stones spontaneously because of their size. It should also be considered in patients with kidney\nstones that are unlikely to pass without significant risk of obstruction or other complications,\nespecially in patients with a solitary functioning kidney. Acute indications for ESWL include\nuncontrolled pain, persistent visible hematuria, or obstruction secondary to urolithiasis.\nContraindications to ESWL are based on higher risks of complications from urinary obstruction or\nlocal tissue injury caused by shock waves. These contraindications include coagulopathy, abdominal\naortic or renal artery aneurysms, severe skeletal abnormalities, pregnancy, untreated urinary tract\ninfection, obstruction distal to the calculus (such as ureteropelvic junction narrowing or megaureter),\nor a more distal stone.\nA female patient with uric acid stones that previously lodged in her distal right ureter (Response\nchoice A) has calculi of softer composition but they may be difficult to locate because of radiolucency.\nHowever, more importantly, this patient has issues with calculi lodging in the distal ureter, possibly\nbecause of relative narrowing. The distal ureter is a less optimal location for ESWL, because\nureteroscopy has a much greater success rate, and ESWL has a higher risk of morbidity in female\npatients of childbearing age. A male patient with a staghorn calculus in the left renal pelvis (Response\nchoice C) has a calculus material (struvite) that is amenable to shock wave therapy. However, the\nsize of staghorn calculi and the high likelihood of recurrence if not completely cleared make ESWL a\nmuch less desirable therapy, with nephrolithotomy often recommended. A patient with 1-cm cystine\nstones in both lower poles (Response choice D) has calculi composed of a denser material and\n\nlocated in a more difficult position for fragment clearance, making the patient a less than ideal\ncandidate. Lastly, a patient with a 1.5-cm calcium oxalate dihydrate stone in the upper right pole\n(Response choice B) has a calculus composed of softer material, located in a position with good\noutcome, and sufficiently sized (< 20 mm) so that ESWL is likely to completely clear the stone.\nPREP Pearls\n Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy has a relatively high rate of complete stone clearance in pediatric\npatients who are properly selected.\n For stones greater than 20 mm in length, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy has a significantly lower\nsuccess rate than for stones less than 20 mm in length, especially in cases of staghorn calculi.\n Cystine and other denser stone materials are less likely to respond to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Understand the principles of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy\n Know the indications of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in different types of nephrolithiasis\nSuggested Readings\n Assimos D, Krambeck A, Miller NL, et al.

    "explanation": "A. exon 4 of the uromodulin gene (UMOD)\nThe constellation of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings in this young patient —hyposthenuria\nassociated with enuresis, nocturia, polydipsia, polyuria, a bland urine sediment, normal blood\npressure, anemia disproportional to the degree of reduced glomerular filtration rate, growth failure,\nand increased echogenicity on renal ultrasonography —is characteristic of a group of inherited\ninterstitial kidney diseases (IKDs) with overlapping clinical presentations.\nInterstitial kidney disorders can be autosomal recessive (nephronophthisis) or autosomal dominant.\nDistinguishing features of autosomal recessive IKD are extrarenal manifestations and earlier onset of\nend-stage kidney disease (before age 25 years). Hyperuricemia is a distinguishing feature of\nautosomal dominant IKD (ADIKD), also referred to as autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney\ndisease. The family history in this patient is more consistent with an autosomal dominant inheritance\npattern. Other features suggestive of ADIKD in this patient are the presence of hyperuricemia and the\nabsence of extrarenal manifestations.\nFour related groups of autosomal dominant genetic renal diseases compose ADIKD:\n Mucin-1–associated ADIKD (also known as medullary cystic kidney disease, type 1) presents\nlater in life (mean age, 62 years), usually with chronic kidney disease. Mucin-1–associated\nADIKD disease is not associated with hyperuricemia early in life. Approximately 40% of these\npatients display 1 or more small corticomedullary cysts on renal ultrasonography; the cysts\nmay be unilateral or bilateral.\n Uromodulin-associated ADIKD (also known as familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy or\nmedullary cystic kidney disease, type 2) results in end-stage kidney disease at a mean age of\n32 years and is characterized by early onset hyperuricemia and hypouricosuria. Uromodulin\n(Tamm-Horsfall protein) is a kidney-specific protein that is expressed in the thick ascending\nlimb of Henle. Most mutations in the uromodulin gene, UMOD, are clustered in exons 4 or 5\nand result in an abnormal uromodulin protein that obstructs the lumen of the thick ascending\nlimb of Henle; this obstruction leads to tubular dilation, disruption of the basement membrane,\nand interstitial fibrosis with inflammation. Corticomedullary cysts are found in uromodulin-\nassociated disease but at a much lower frequency than in mucin-1–associated disease.\n Renin-associated ADIKD is a very rare disorder that has only been identified in a few families\nworldwide. Renin-associated ADIKD is caused by a mutation that prevents processing of the\nsignal peptide in the pre-prorenin protein, resulting in accumulation of immature renin in the\ncell cytoplasm, which leads to apoptosis and tubular loss. Renin-associated ADIKD usually\npresents in early life with salt-losing nephropathy, hyperkalemia, and hyperuricemia.\n Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β–associated ADIKD (glomerulocystic kidney disease) is relatively\ncommon, presents early in life, and is associated with cortical renal cysts. It can be\ndistinguished from other forms of ADIKD by the presence of diabetes mellitus (previously\ncalled maturity-onset diabetes of the young [MODY] with renal cysts or MODY-5).\nFor the patient in this vignette, a mutation in the renin gene (REN) is unlikely given the absence of\nsalt wasting and hyperkalemia and the relatively late-onset presentation, despite the presence of\nhyperuricemia. A mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β gene (HNF1B) is also less likely given\nthe absence of cortical renal cysts and diabetes. Nephronophthisis (an autosomal recessive disease)\n\ncaused by a mutation in NPHP1, which encodes nephrocystin-1, is unlikely because of the autosomal\ndominant pattern of inheritance and hyperuricemia.\nPREP Pearls\n A child exhibiting urinary concentrating defect, anemia, chronic kidney disease, and growth failure should be\nsuspected of having an inherited interstitial kidney disease.\n Autosomal dominant inheritance, the absence of extrarenal manifestations, and the presence of hyperuricemia\nfavor a diagnosis of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease rather than autosomal recessive interstitial\nkidney disease (nephronophthisis).\n Hyperuricemia in a patient with clinical autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease suggests uromodulin-\nassociated disease (medullary cystic kidney disease, type 2).\n The absence of corticomedullary renal cysts does not exclude the diagnosis of interstitial kidney disease.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Recognize related disorders such as familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy and glomerular cystic disease\nSuggested Readings\n Eckardt KU, Alper SL, Antignac C, et al.

    "explanation": "D. increasing ibuprofen dose\nThis vignette describes an infant who has Bartter syndrome. Bartter syndrome encompases a related\ngroup of disorders that involve impaired sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of\nthe loop of Henle. Patients have downstream compensations, including overproduction of renal\nprostaglandin E2 and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, that result in secondary\nhypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs), such as ibuprofen or indomethacin, are effective treatments for Bartter\nsyndrome. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce glomerular filtration rate and natriuresis and\nconsequently reduce polyuria and electrolyte wasting. These reductions will decrease the stimulation\nof the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and also improve the associated hypokalemia and\nmetabolic alkalosis. Because the patient in this vignette has worsening polyuria and failure to thrive,\nincreasing his ibuprofen dose would be an appropriate treatment option.\nPatients with Bartter syndrome typically pass isotonic urine, reflecting the loss of function of the loop\nof Henle’s concentrating mechanism. Patients with type 1 Bartter syndrome may develop hypotonic\nurine when the distal convoluted tubule is stimulated to reabsorb sodium in the absence of water.\nTherefore, secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a relatively well-understood complication\nassociated with Bartter syndrome, but it does not respond to desmopressin. Further evaluation to\nassess the response to desmopressin would not be necessary, nor would genetic testing for\nvasopressin 2 receptor mutations. Thiazide diuretics, a well-studied therapy for primary nephrogenic\ndiabetes insipidus, and also a potential therapeutic option for hypercalciuria, would inhibit an\nimportant compensatory mechanism that prevents worsening hypovolemia in Bartter syndrome. They\nare typically not well tolerated in patients with Bartter syndrome and should be avoided. Angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme inhibitor therapy is sometimes used to decrease potassium excretion and improve\nhypokalemia in Bartter syndrome. However, this treatment does not improve polyuria and may\nworsen hypovolemia, posing a risk for hypotension. In this patient with near normal potassium levels,\nmaximizing other therapeutic options such as prostaglandin inhibition would be preferred.\nOver the past few decades, the molecular genetics of Bartter syndrome have been clarified, allowing\nfor a markedly enhanced understanding of sodium chloride reabsorption at the thick ascending limb\nof the loop of Henle. This transcellular sodium chloride reabsorption requires a number of\ntransporters, channels, and proteins that include:\n NKCC2 (furosemide-sensitive sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter 2), a cotransporter that\npermits movement of sodium, potassium, and chloride from the tubular lumen into the tubular\ncell and is defective in type 1 Bartter syndrome\n ROMK (renal outer medullary potassium channel), an apical potassium channel that recycles\npotassium back into the tubular lumen, maintaining adequate luminal levels for NKCC2 to\nmove potassium intracellularly; defective in type 2 Bartter syndrome\n CLCNKB (chloride channel Kb), a basolateral chloride channel that moves chloride\nextracellularly, providing a favorable chloride gradient for NKCC2; defective in type 3 Bartter\nsyndrome\n Barttin, a subunit necessary for the function of CLCNKB; defective in type 4 Bartter syndrome\nThe molecular effects of the genetic defects associated with Bartter syndrome are shown in\nthe Figure.\n\nAdditional figure from previous prep.Courtesy of Kim REidy.: Genetic Defects Associated With Bartter\nSyndrome\nCourtesy of K. Reidy\nEach type of Bartter syndrome is treated similarly with sodium and potassium supplementation and\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as the mainstay of therapy. However, there may be subtle\ndifferences in the clinical presentations of the different types (Table).\nTable.

Weinstein\nBartter syndrome type 1, caused by the loss of function of NKCC2, typically presents in the neonatal\nperiod with marked, often life-threatening, polyuria and urinary sodium chloride wasting.\nPolyhydramnios and premature delivery are common. As compensatory mechanisms in proximal and\ndistal segments of the nephron mature, the polyuria becomes less severe, but hypokalemic metabolic\nalkalosis, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis predominate. Hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis are\nimportant prognostic factors that are challenging to treat because thiazide diuretics are not well\n\ntolerated. As nephrocalcinosis develops and progresses, Bartter syndrome patients will be at risk for\nchronic kidney disease and progressive loss of renal function.\nBartter syndrome types 2 and 4 also typically present in the neonatal period. Type 3 often presents\nlater during the school-aged years because its severity is mitigated by a chloride channel, CLCNKA,\nthat is expressed at lower levels in the basolateral membrane of the thick ascending limb of the loop\nof Henle. Patients with type 2 Bartter syndrome in the neonatal period may have less significant\nhypokalemia, and some may have hyperkalemia because this type of Bartter syndrome is caused by\nmutation of a potassium channel that has important potassium excretion function in more distal\nnephron segments. Patients with type 4 Bartter syndrome can develop sensorineural deafness\nbecause barttin is a necessary subunit for chloride channels in the inner ear as well.\nMore recently, pediatric nephrologists and molecular geneticists have identified type 5 Bartter\nsyndrome, which is caused by a gain of function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor. When\nactivated, the calcium-sensing receptor inhibits the ROMK channel in the thick ascending limb of the\nloop of Henle. This interaction is physiologically intuitive because it inhibits the electrochemical\ngradient that stimulates paracellular calcium reabsorption. Therefore, such activating mutations may\ncreate a similar clinical presentation to type 2 Bartter syndrome. Type 5 Bartter syndrome is\nparticularly associated with hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and hypocalcemia.\nPREP Pearls\n Bartter syndrome is a related group of disorders involving impaired sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick\nascending limb of the loop of Henle. Patients have downstream compensations, including overproduction of\nrenal prostaglandin E2 and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which results in secondary\nhypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.\n Types 1 through 4 of Bartter syndrome are caused by defects in NKCC2, ROMK, CLCNKB, and barttin,\nrespectively. Type 5 Bartter syndrome is caused by gain of function, activating mutations of the calcium-\nsensing receptor.\n Each type of Bartter syndrome is treated similarly with sodium and potassium supplementation and\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs being the mainstay of therapy. However, there may be some subtle\ndifferences in clinical presentation of the different types.\n Patients with type 1 Bartter syndrome may develop hypotonic urine when the distal convoluted tubule is\nstimulated to reabsorb sodium in the absence of water. Therefore, secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is\na relatively well-understood complication associated with Bartter syndrome.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the clinical and laboratory features of the various forms of Bartter syndrome\n Know the treatment and the complications of treatment for the various forms of Bartter syndrome\n Know the natural history of the various forms of Bartter syndrome\nSuggested Readings\n Kleta R, Bockenhauer D.

    "explanation": "D. urinalysis with birefringent needle-shaped crystals\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a common occurrence in critically ill patients. Nephrotoxin exposure\ncauses at least 25% of the episodes of AKI. Advanced age, female sex, chronic kidney disease, low\ncardiac output, and decreased intravascular volume status are risk factors for AKI following\nnephrotoxin exposure. The total dose and duration of nephrotoxin exposure also correlate with the\nrisk for AKI. Prevention and drug level monitoring are the mainstays to avoiding adverse clinical\noutcomes from nephrotoxin exposure.\nNephrotoxin-induced AKI can occur by direct tubular cell toxicity, as seen with aminoglycosides and\ncomputed tomography contrast agents, or by ischemic injury caused by alterations of the renal\nautoregulatory mechanism that influence blood flow, as seen with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.\nThe patient in this vignette most likely has AKI secondary to acyclovir administration in the face of\nintravascular volume depletion. Toxicity occurs when acyclovir precipitates in the distal nephron and\ncauses obstruction in the distal tubules. The urine may demonstrate birefringent needle-shaped\ncrystals. Patients may experience pain or nausea similar to nephrolithiasis-related renal colic that is\nsecondary to these tubular obstruction events. Usually, the toxicity is enhanced or evident in the face\nof intravascular volume depletion. The AKI is usually mild but can be severe and is usually evident\nwithin 1 or 2 days of starting therapy. Hydration to flush the tubules and decrease the increased\nintratubular concentration of acyclovir is the primary treatment. Theoretically, loop diuretics can be\nused to flush the distal nephron, but increased intravenous hydration is needed concurrently.\nSwitching to a less nephrotoxic agent such as ganciclovir should also be considered if antiviral\ntherapy is indicated.\nNephrotoxin-induced AKI can be distinguished from ischemic/vasomotor AKI in a number of ways.\nFirst, prerenal azotemia, oliguria, and a low fractional excretion of sodium will precede tubular injury\nin ischemic AKI. As renal blood flow decreases, prostaglandin synthesis relaxes glomerular afferent\narterioles and angiotensin II constricts efferent arterioles. If hypoperfusion persists, tubular epithelial\ncells, especially in the S3 segment of the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of\nHenle, become damaged secondary to hypoxia. Tubular cells lose polarity and start to undergo\ndysfunction, which leads to worsening salt/water losses that accelerate the intravascular volume\ndepletion. This finding is also compounded with tubular sloughing/cast formation, damage to the\nendothelium, and tubular leaks leading to inflammation and generation of damaging reactive oxygen\nspecies.\nAn overview of common types of AKI, causative agents and states, and sites of injury is presented in\nthe Table.\n\nTable.

    "explanation": "C. genetic testing can help predict risk of malignancy, and renal imaging is recommended every 3\nmonths until 8 years of age\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome with a multitude of manifestations (Table\n1). Patients with one or more criteria should be suspected of having the syndrome. Renal involvement\nmay present early with structural abnormalities (eg, duplicated collecting system, cystic changes,\ndiverticula), nephromegaly, and hyperechogenicity of the cortex/medulla or present later with\nnephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and medullary sponge kidney.\nThe most concerning complication is malignancy (overall risk, 7.5%). Virtually all Beckwith-\nWiedemann syndrome–associated malignancies occur during the first 10 years of age. The most\ncommon malignancies are Wilms tumor (approximately 40%) and hepatoblastoma (approximately\n20%). Less common malignancies include neuroblastoma, pancreatoblastoma, adrenocortical\ncarcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia.\nThe risk for Wilms tumor is concentrated in the first 8 years of age, with a median age of presentation\nof 24 months. Although there is no uniform international consensus on tumor surveillance,\nultrasonography screening for the detection of Wilms tumor is often recommended every 3 months\nuntil 8 years of age. The risk of Wilms tumor development after 8 years of age is minimal.\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can be caused by a number of genetic and epigenetic disorders on\nchromosomal region 11p15 (Table 2). Less than 15% of cases are familial, and no genetic or\nepigenetic cause is found in 10% to 15% of cases. The 11p15 region harbors clusters of genes under\nthe control of DNA methylation and regulatory regions. One region includes imprinting center 1, which\nregulates H19 (a non-protein coding gene) and IGF2(encodes insulin-like growth factor 2). Normally,\nonly the paternal allele is methylated, and IGF2 is only expressed from that allele (H19 is only\ntranscribed from maternal allele). Imprinting center 2 controls KCNQ1OT1 (a non-protein coding\ngene) and CDKN1C (encodes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C) such that imprinting center 2 is\nnormally methylated only on the maternal allele and CDKN1C/p57 is only expressed from that allele.\nThe usual problem in individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is aberrant methylation of\nthese regions that is sometimes caused by paternal uniparental disomy (2 copies of the chromosomal\nregion are inherited from the father).\nThe cancer risk varies depending on the individual’s genetic characteristics. Individuals with aberrant\nmethylation of imprinting center 1 have the highest cancer risk (28%), as determined by data pooled\nfrom 8 studies (almost 2,000 patients). Wilms tumor accounted for 85% of these cancers; the\nremaining 15% of cancers were hepatoblastoma and other cancers. Individuals with uniparental\ndisomy had the second highest cancer risk (15%), and approximately 50% of these cancers were\nWilms tumor. Individuals with abnormalities in imprinting center 2 had the lowest cancer risk (2.6%);\nonly 7% of these cancers were Wilms tumor, 27% were hepatoblastoma, and the remainder were\nother tumors. Some practitioners have advocated a personalized screening regimen based on\nindividual genetic profiles.\nIn addition to ultrasonography every 3 months, screening for hepatoblastoma by serum α-fetoprotein\nmeasurement is recommended every 3 months until 4 years of age.\nPREP Pearls\n Individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome require ultrasonography every 3 months until 8 years of age\nto screen for Wilms tumor.\n Individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can have a variety of renal lesions including nephrocalcinosis\nand nephrolithiasis.\n\n Individuals with aberrant methylation of imprinting center 1 have the highest cancer risk.\nAmerican Board of Pediatrics Content Specification(s)\n Know the complications of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome including malignancy and the role of monitoring\nSuggested Readings\n Kalish JM, Deardorff MA.
